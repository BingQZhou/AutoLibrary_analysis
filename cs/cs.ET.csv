0,Checking Equivalence of Quantum Circuits and States,"  Quantum computing promises exponential speed-ups for important simulation and
optimization problems. It also poses new CAD problems that are similar to, but
more challenging, than the related problems in classical (non-quantum) CAD,
such as determining if two states or circuits are functionally equivalent.
While differences in classical states are easy to detect, quantum states, which
are represented by complex-valued vectors, exhibit subtle differences leading
to several notions of equivalence. This provides flexibility in optimizing
quantum circuits, but leads to difficult new equivalence-checking issues for
simulation and synthesis. We identify several different equivalence-checking
problems and present algorithms for practical benchmarks, including quantum
communication and search circuits, which are shown to be very fast and robust
for hundreds of qubits.
"
1,On the CNOT-cost of TOFFOLI gates,"  The three-input TOFFOLI gate is the workhorse of circuit synthesis for
classical logic operations on quantum data, e.g., reversible arithmetic
circuits. In physical implementations, however, TOFFOLI gates are decomposed
into six CNOT gates and several one-qubit gates. Though this decomposition has
been known for at least 10 years, we provide here the first demonstration of
its CNOT-optimality.
  We study three-qubit circuits which contain less than six CNOT gates and
implement a block-diagonal operator, then show that they implicitly describe
the cosine-sine decomposition of a related operator. Leveraging the canonicity
of such decompositions to limit one-qubit gates appearing in respective
circuits, we prove that the n-qubit analogue of the TOFFOLI requires at least
2n CNOT gates. Additionally, our results offer a complete classification of
three-qubit diagonal operators by their CNOT-cost, which holds even if ancilla
qubits are available.

2,"Steering plasmodium with light: Dynamical programming of Physarum
  machine","  A plasmodium of Physarum polycephalum is a very large cell visible by unaided
eye. The plasmodium is capable for distributed sensing, parallel information
processing, and decentralized optimization. It is an ideal substrate for future
and emerging bio-computing devices. We study space-time dynamics of plasmodium
reactiom to localised illumination, and provide analogies between propagating
plasmodium and travelling wave-fragments in excitable media. We show how
plasmodium-based computing devices can be precisely controlled and shaped by
planar domains of illumination.
"
3,Fast Equivalence-checking for Quantum Circuits,"  We perform formal verification of quantum circuits by integrating several
techniques specialized to particular classes of circuits. Our verification
methodology is based on the new notion of a reversible miter that allows one to
leverage existing techniques for circuit simplification of quantum circuits.
For reversible circuits which arise as runtime bottlenecks of key quantum
algorithms, we develop several verification techniques and empirically compare
them.
  We also combine existing quantum verification tools with the use of
SAT-solvers. Experiments with circuits for Shor's number-factoring algorithm,
containing thousands of gates, show improvements in efficiency by 3-4 orders of
magnitude.
"
4,Fast matrix multiplication techniques based on the Adleman-Lipton model,"  On distributed memory electronic computers, the implementation and
association of fast parallel matrix multiplication algorithms has yielded
astounding results and insights. In this discourse, we use the tools of
molecular biology to demonstrate the theoretical encoding of Strassen's fast
matrix multiplication algorithm with DNA based on an $n$-moduli set in the
residue number system, thereby demonstrating the viability of computational
mathematics with DNA. As a result, a general scalable implementation of this
model in the DNA computing paradigm is presented and can be generalized to the
application of \emph{all} fast matrix multiplication algorithms on a DNA
computer. We also discuss the practical capabilities and issues of this
scalable implementation. Fast methods of matrix computations with DNA are
important because they also allow for the efficient implementation of other
algorithms (i.e. inversion, computing determinants, and graph theory) with DNA.
"
5,"High-performance Energy Minimization with Applications to Adiabatic
  Quantum Computing","  Energy minimization of Ising spin-glasses has played a central role in
statistical and solid-state physics, facilitating studies of phase transitions
and magnetism. Recent proposals suggest using Ising spin-glasses for
non-traditional computing as a way to harness the nature's ability to find
min-energy configurations, and to take advantage of quantum tunneling to boost
combinatorial optimization. Laboratory demonstrations have been unconvincing so
far and lack a non-quantum baseline for definitive comparisons. In this work we
(i) design and evaluate new computational techniques to simulate natural energy
minimization in spin glasses and (ii) explore their application to study design
alternatives in quantum adiabatic computers. Unlike previous work, our
algorithms are not limited to planar Ising topologies. In one CPU-day, our
branch-and-bound algorithm finds ground states on 100 spins, while our local
search approximates ground states on 1, 000, 000 spins. We use this
computational tool as a simulator to study the significance of hyper-couplings
in the context of recently implemented adiabatic quantum computers.
"
6,A Library-Based Synthesis Methodology for Reversible Logic,"  In this paper, a library-based synthesis methodology for reversible circuits
is proposed where a reversible specification is considered as a permutation
comprising a set of cycles. To this end, a pre-synthesis optimization step is
introduced to construct a reversible specification from an irreversible
function. In addition, a cycle-based representation model is presented to be
used as an intermediate format in the proposed synthesis methodology. The
selected intermediate format serves as a focal point for all potential
representation models. In order to synthesize a given function, a library
containing seven building blocks is used where each building block is a cycle
of length less than 6. To synthesize large cycles, we also propose a
decomposition algorithm which produces all possible minimal and inequivalent
factorizations for a given cycle of length greater than 5. All decompositions
contain the maximum number of disjoint cycles. The generated decompositions are
used in conjunction with a novel cycle assignment algorithm which is proposed
based on the graph matching problem to select the best possible cycle pairs.
Then, each pair is synthesized by using the available components of the
library. The decomposition algorithm together with the cycle assignment method
are considered as a binding method which selects a building block from the
library for each cycle. Finally, a post-synthesis optimization step is
introduced to optimize the synthesis results in terms of different costs.
"
7,Rule-Based Optimization of Reversible Circuits,"  Reversible logic has applications in various research areas including
low-power design and quantum computation. In this paper, a rule-based
optimization approach for reversible circuits is proposed which uses both
negative and positive control Toffoli gates during the optimization. To this
end, a set of rules for removing NOT gates and optimizing sub-circuits with
common-target gates are proposed. To evaluate the proposed approach, the
best-reported synthesized circuits and the results of a recent synthesis
algorithm which uses both negative and positive controls are used. Our
experiments reveal the potential of the proposed approach in optimizing
synthesized circuits.
"
8,Reversible Circuit Synthesis Using a Cycle-Based Approach,"  Reversible logic has applications in various research areas including signal
processing, cryptography and quantum computation. In this paper, direct
NCT-based synthesis of a given $k$-cycle in a cycle-based synthesis scenario is
examined. To this end, a set of seven building blocks is proposed that reveals
the potential of direct synthesis of a given permutation to reduce both quantum
cost and average runtime. To synthesize a given large cycle, we propose a
decomposition algorithm to extract the suggested building blocks from the input
specification. Then, a synthesis method is introduced which uses the building
blocks and the decomposition algorithm. Finally, a hybrid synthesis framework
is suggested which uses the proposed cycle-based synthesis method in
conjunction with one of the recent NCT-based synthesis approaches which is
based on Reed-Muller (RM) spectra. The time complexity and the effectiveness of
the proposed synthesis approach are analyzed in detail. Our analyses show that
the proposed hybrid framework leads to a better quantum cost in the worst-case
scenario compared to the previously presented methods. The proposed framework
always converges and typically synthesizes a given specification very fast
compared to the available synthesis algorithms. Besides, the quantum costs of
benchmark functions are improved about 20% on average (55% in the best case).
"
9,How to build a DNA search engine like Google?,"  This paper proposed a new method to build the large scale DNA sequences
search system based on web search engine technology. We give a very brief
introduction for the methods used in search engine first. Then how to build a
DNA search system like Google is illustrated in detail. Since there is no local
alignment process, this system is able to provide the ms level search services
for billions of DNA sequences in a typical server.
"
10,Block-based quantum-logic synthesis,"  In this paper, the problem of constructing an efficient quantum circuit for
the implementation of an arbitrary quantum computation is addressed. To this
end, a basic block based on the cosine-sine decomposition method is suggested
which contains $l$ qubits. In addition, a previously proposed quantum-logic
synthesis method based on quantum Shannon decomposition is recursively applied
to reach unitary gates over $l$ qubits. Then, the basic block is used and some
optimizations are applied to remove redundant gates. It is shown that the exact
value of $l$ affects the number of one-qubit and CNOT gates in the proposed
method. In comparison to the previous synthesis methods, the value of $l$ is
examined consequently to improve either the number of CNOT gates or the total
number of gates. The proposed approach is further analyzed by considering the
nearest neighbor limitation. According to our evaluation, the number of CNOT
gates is increased by at most a factor of $\frac{5}{3}$ if the nearest neighbor
interaction is applied.

11,"Towards Biochemical Filter with Sigmoidal Response to pH Changes:
  Buffered Biocatalytic Signal Transduction","  We realize a biochemical filtering process by introducing a buffer in a
biocatalytic signal-transduction logic system based on the function of an
enzyme, esterase. The input, ethyl butyrate, is converted into butyric acid-the
output signal, which in turn is measured by the drop in the pH value. The
developed approach offers a versatile ""network element"" for increasing the
complexity of biochemical information processing systems. Evaluation of an
optimal regime for quality filtering is accomplished in the framework of a
kinetic rate-equation model.
"
12,"Noise-based information processing: Noise-based logic and computing:
  what do we have so far?","  We briefly introduce noise-based logic. After describing the main motivations
we outline classical, instantaneous (squeezed and non-squeezed), continuum,
spike and random-telegraph-signal based schemes with applications such as
circuits that emulate the brain functioning and string verification via a slow
communication channel.
"
13,Cluster quantum computer on the basis of quasi-part,"  The present paper deals with the possibility of creation of the quantum
computer in which the role of q-bits is played by quasi-particles. In such a
computer, the elementary computation block should represent a cluster created
on the basis of the paramagnetic molecules. The latter form heterogeneous spin
states in the cluster owing to the presence of interelectron correlations.
"
14,"Artificial Immune Privileged Sites as an Enhancement to Immuno-Computing
  Paradigm","  The immune system is a highly parallel and distributed intelligent system
which has learning, memory, and associative capabilities. Artificial Immune
System is an evolutionary paradigm inspired by the biological aspects of the
immune system of mammals. The immune system can inspire to form new algorithms
learning from its course of action. The human immune system has motivated
scientists and engineers for finding powerful information processing algorithms
that has solved complex engineering problems. This work is the result of an
attempt to explore a different perspective of the immune system namely the
Immune Privileged Site (IPS) which has the ability to make an exception to
different parts of the body by not triggering immune response to some of the
foreign agent in these parts of the body. While the complete system is secured
by an Immune System at certain times it may be required that the system allows
certain activities which may be harmful to other system which is useful to it
and learns over a period of time through the immune privilege model as done in
case of Immune Privilege Sites in Natural Immune System.
"
15,"Hybrid CMOS-MQCA Logic Architectures using Multi-Layer Spintronic
  Devices","  We present a novel hybrid CMOS-MQCA architecture using multi-layer Spintronic
devices as computing elements. A feasibility study is presented with 22nm CMOS
where new approaches for spin transfer torque induced clocking and read-out
scheme for variability-tolerance are introduced. A first-of-its-kind Spintronic
device model enables circuit simulation using existing CAD infrastructure.
Approximately 70% reduction in energy consumption is observed when compared
against conventional field-induced clocking scheme.
"
16,Solving mazes with memristors: a massively-parallel approach,"  Solving mazes is not just a fun pastime. Mazes are prototype models in graph
theory, topology, robotics, traffic optimization, psychology, and in many other
areas of science and technology. However, when maze complexity increases their
solution becomes cumbersome and very time consuming. Here, we show that a
network of memristors - resistors with memory - can solve such a non-trivial
problem quite easily. In particular, maze solving by the network of memristors
occurs in a massively parallel fashion since all memristors in the network
participate simultaneously in the calculation. The result of the calculation is
then recorded into the memristors' states, and can be used and/or recovered at
a later time. Furthermore, the network of memristors finds all possible
solutions in multiple-solution mazes, and sorts out the solution paths
according to their length. Our results demonstrate not only the first
application of memristive networks to the field of massively-parallel
computing, but also a novel algorithm to solve mazes which could find
applications in different research fields.
"
17,Reversible Circuit Optimization via Leaving the Boolean Domain,"  For years, the quantum/reversible circuit community has been convinced that:
a) the addition of auxiliary qubits is instrumental in constructing a smaller
quantum circuit; and, b) the introduction of quantum gates inside reversible
circuits may result in more efficient designs. This paper presents a systematic
approach to optimizing reversible (and quantum) circuits via the introduction
of auxiliary qubits and quantum gates inside circuit designs. This advances our
understanding of what may be achieved with a) and b).
"
18,A Study of Optimal 4-bit Reversible Toffoli Circuits and Their Synthesis,"  Optimal synthesis of reversible functions is a non-trivial problem. One of
the major limiting factors in computing such circuits is the sheer number of
reversible functions. Even restricting synthesis to 4-bit reversible functions
results in a huge search space (16! {\approx} 2^{44} functions). The output of
such a search alone, counting only the space required to list Toffoli gates for
every function, would require over 100 terabytes of storage. In this paper, we
present two algorithms: one, that synthesizes an optimal circuit for any 4-bit
reversible specification, and another that synthesizes all optimal
implementations. We employ several techniques to make the problem tractable. We
report results from several experiments, including synthesis of all optimal
4-bit permutations, synthesis of random 4-bit permutations, optimal synthesis
of all 4-bit linear reversible circuits, synthesis of existing benchmark
functions; we compose a list of the hardest permutations to synthesize, and
show distribution of optimal circuits. We further illustrate that our proposed
approach may be extended to accommodate physical constraints via reporting
LNN-optimal reversible circuits. Our results have important implications in the
design and optimization of reversible and quantum circuits, testing circuit
synthesis heuristics, and performing experiments in the area of quantum
information processing.
"
19,Quantum Reading of a Classical Digital Memory,"  We consider a basic model of digital memory where each cell is composed of a
reflecting medium with two possible reflectivities. By fixing the mean number
of photons irradiated over each memory cell, we show that a non-classical
source of light can retrieve more information than any classical source. This
improvement is shown in the regime of few photons and high reflectivities,
where the gain of information can be surprising. As a result, the use of
quantum light can have non-trivial applications in the technology of digital
memories, such as optical disks and barcodes.
"
20,ReveR: Software Simulator of Reversible Processor with Stack,"  A software model of a reversible processor ReveR with the stack is discussed
in this paper. An architecture, the minimal set of elementary reversible
operations together with an implementation of the basic control flow structures
and procedures calls using simple assembler language are described.
"
21,Vesicle computers: Approximating Voronoi diagram on Voronoi automata,"  Irregular arrangements of vesicles filled with excitable and precipitating
chemical systems are imitated by Voronoi automata --- finite-state machines
defined on a planar Voronoi diagram. Every Voronoi cell takes four states:
resting, excited, refractory and precipitate. A resting cell excites if it has
at least one excited neighbour; the cell precipitates if a ratio of excited
cells in its neighbourhood to its number of neighbours exceed certain
threshold. To approximate a Voronoi diagram on Voronoi automata we project a
planar set onto automaton lattice, thus cells corresponding to data-points are
excited. Excitation waves propagate across the Voronoi automaton, interact with
each other and form precipitate in result of the interaction. Configuration of
precipitate represents edges of approximated Voronoi diagram. We discover
relation between quality of Voronoi diagram approximation and precipitation
threshold, and demonstrate feasibility of our model in approximation Voronoi
diagram of arbitrary-shaped objects and a skeleton of a planar shape.
"
22,Simulating Spiking Neural P systems without delays using GPUs,"  We present in this paper our work regarding simulating a type of P system
known as a spiking neural P system (SNP system) using graphics processing units
(GPUs). GPUs, because of their architectural optimization for parallel
computations, are well-suited for highly parallelizable problems. Due to the
advent of general purpose GPU computing in recent years, GPUs are not limited
to graphics and video processing alone, but include computationally intensive
scientific and mathematical applications as well. Moreover P systems, including
SNP systems, are inherently and maximally parallel computing models whose
inspirations are taken from the functioning and dynamics of a living cell. In
particular, SNP systems try to give a modest but formal representation of a
special type of cell known as the neuron and their interactions with one
another. The nature of SNP systems allowed their representation as matrices,
which is a crucial step in simulating them on highly parallel devices such as
GPUs. The highly parallel nature of SNP systems necessitate the use of hardware
intended for parallel computations. The simulation algorithms, design
considerations, and implementation are presented. Finally, simulation results,
observations, and analyses using an SNP system that generates all numbers in
$\mathbb N$ - {1} are discussed, as well as recommendations for future work.
"
23,"Design and experimental demonstration of a high-directive emission with
  optical transformations","  With the explosion of wireless networks and automotive radar systems, there
is an acute need for new materials and technologies that would not only
minimize the size of these devices, but also enhance their performances. The
technique of transformation optics-an innovative approach to produce artificial
metamaterials that control electromagnetic waves as if space itself was
transformed-provides unique opportunities to reach this goal. In this paper we
design, fabricate and characterize a new class of metamaterial capable of
transforming the source distribution and radiation pattern of an isotropic
microwave emitter. Our findings have considerable implications for the
development of new ultradirective antennas with superior performances and
compactness compared to conventional antennas operating in the same frequency
range.
"
24,Self-Assembly with Geometric Tiles,"  In this work we propose a generalization of Winfree's abstract Tile Assembly
Model (aTAM) in which tile types are assigned rigid shapes, or geometries,
along each tile face. We examine the number of distinct tile types needed to
assemble shapes within this model, the temperature required for efficient
assembly, and the problem of designing compact geometric faces to meet given
compatibility specifications. Our results show a dramatic decrease in the
number of tile types needed to assemble $n \times n$ squares to
$\Theta(\sqrt{\log n})$ at temperature 1 for the most simple model which meets
a lower bound from Kolmogorov complexity, and $O(\log\log n)$ in a model in
which tile aggregates must move together through obstacle free paths within the
plane. This stands in contrast to the $\Theta(\log n / \log\log n)$ tile types
at temperature 2 needed in the basic aTAM. We also provide a general method for
simulating a large and computationally universal class of temperature 2 aTAM
systems with geometric tiles at temperature 1. Finally, we consider the problem
of computing a set of compact geometric faces for a tile system to implement a
given set of compatibility specifications. We show a number of bounds on the
complexity of geometry size needed for various classes of compatibility
specifications, many of which we directly apply to our tile assembly results to
achieve non-trivial reductions in geometry size.
"
25,"Efficient Squares and Turing Universality at Temperature 1 with a Unique
  Negative Glue","  Is Winfree's abstract Tile Assembly Model (aTAM) ""powerful?"" Well, if certain
tiles are required to ""cooperate"" in order to be able to bind to a growing tile
assembly (a.k.a., temperature 2 self-assembly), then Turing universal
computation and the efficient self-assembly of $N \times N$ squares is
achievable in the aTAM (Rotemund and Winfree, STOC 2000). So yes, in a
computational sense, the aTAM is quite powerful! However, if one completely
removes this cooperativity condition (a.k.a., temperature 1 self-assembly),
then the computational ""power"" of the aTAM (i.e., its ability to support Turing
universal computation and the efficient self-assembly of $N \times N$ squares)
becomes unknown. On the plus side, the aTAM, at temperature 1, isn't only
Turing universal but also supports the efficient self-assembly $N \times N$
squares if self-assembly is allowed to utilize three spatial dimensions (Fu,
Schweller and Cook, SODA 2011). We investigate the theoretical ""power"" of a
seemingly simple, restrictive class of tile assembly systems (TASs) in which
(1) the absolute value of every glue strength is 1, (2) there's a single
negative strength glue type and (3) unequal glues can't interact. We call these
the \emph{restricted glue} TASs (rgTAS). We first show the tile complexity of
producing an $N \times N$ square with an rgTAS is $O(\frac{\log n}{\log \log
n})$. We also prove that rgTASs are Turing universal with a construction that
simulates an arbitrary Turing machine. Next, we provide results for a variation
of the rgTAS class, partially restricted glue TASs, which is similar except
that the magnitude of the negative glue's strength can only assumed to be $\ge
1$. These results consist of a construction with $O(\log n)$ tile complexity
for building $N \times N$ squares, and one which simulates a Turing machine but
with a greater scaling factor than for the rgTAS construction.
"
26,"DNA Circuits Based on Isothermal Constrained Loop Extension DNA
  Amplification","  In this paper, we first describe the isothermal constrained loop extension
DNA amplification (ICLEDA), which is a new variant of amplification combining
the advantages of rolling circle amplification (RCA) and of strand displacement
amplification (SDA). Then, we formalize this process in terms of the theory of
formal languages and show, on the basis of this formulation, how to manage OR
and AND gates. We then explain how to introduce negation, which allows us to
prove that, in principle, it is possible to implement the computation of any
boolean function on DNA strands using ICLEDA.
"
27,Mobile Computing in Digital Ecosystems: Design Issues and Challenges,"  In this paper we argue that the set of wireless, mobile devices (e.g.,
portable telephones, tablet PCs, GPS navigators, media players) commonly used
by human users enables the construction of what we term a digital ecosystem,
i.e., an ecosystem constructed out of so-called digital organisms (see below),
that can foster the development of novel distributed services. In this context,
a human user equipped with his/her own mobile devices, can be though of as a
digital organism (DO), a subsystem characterized by a set of peculiar features
and resources it can offer to the rest of the ecosystem for use from its peer
DOs. The internal organization of the DO must address issues of management of
its own resources, including power consumption. Inside the DO and among DOs,
peer-to-peer interaction mechanisms can be conveniently deployed to favor
resource sharing and data dissemination. Throughout this paper, we show that
most of the solutions and technologies needed to construct a digital ecosystem
are already available. What is still missing is a framework (i.e., mechanisms,
protocols, services) that can support effectively the integration and
cooperation of these technologies. In addition, in the following we show that
that framework can be implemented as a middleware subsystem that enables novel
and ubiquitous forms of computation and communication. Finally, in order to
illustrate the effectiveness of our approach, we introduce some experimental
results we have obtained from preliminary implementations of (parts of) that
subsystem.
"
28,"Realization and Properties of Biochemical-Computing Biocatalytic XOR
  Gate Based on Enzyme Inhibition by a Substrate","  We consider a realization of the XOR logic gate in a process biocatalyzed by
an enzyme (here horseradish peroxidase: HRP), the function of which can be
inhibited by a substrate (hydrogen peroxide for HRP), when the latter is
inputted at large enough concentrations. A model is developed for describing
such systems in an approach suitable for evaluation of the analog noise
amplification properties of the gate. The obtained data are fitted for gate
quality evaluation within the developed model, and we discuss aspects of
devising XOR gates for functioning in ""biocomputing"" systems utilizing
biomolecules for information processing.
"
29,"Trans-Canada Slimeways: Slime mould imitates the Canadian transport
  network","  Slime mould Physarum polycephalum builds up sophisticated networks to
transport nutrients between distant part of its extended body. The slime
mould's protoplasmic network is optimised for maximum coverage of nutrients yet
minimum energy spent on transportation of the intra-cellular material. In
laboratory experiments with P. polycephalum we represent Canadian major urban
areas with rolled oats and inoculated slime mould in the Toronto area. The
plasmodium spans the urban areas with its network of protoplasmic tubes. We
uncover similarities and differences between the protoplasmic network and the
Canadian national highway network, analyse the networks in terms of proximity
graphs and evaluate slime mould's network response to contamination.
"
30,Reducing Quantum Cost in Reversible Toffoli Circuits,"  Recently, reversible circuit synthesis has been intensively studied. One of
the problems that has not been solved for a long time was exact minimization of
gate count (GC) in 4-bit circuits. Finally, last year a tool of practical usage
for finding optimal gate count Toffoli networks for any 4-variable function was
developed. However, not much work has been done yet on exact minimization of
quantum cost (QC) in 4-bit circuits. This paper presents an application of the
above mentioned tool to reducing QC of 4-bit reversible circuits. It is shown
that for benchmarks and for designs taken from recent publications it is
possible to obtain savings in QC of up to 74% comparing with previously known
circuits.

  Informal Environments","  Online conference proceedings for the IWDECIE workshop, taking place in New
Orleans on June 5th, 2011. The workshop focuses on non-conventional
implementations of bioinspired algorithms and its conceptual implications.
"
32,Slime mould computes planar shapes,"  Computing a polygon defining a set of planar points is a classical problem of
modern computational geometry. In laboratory experiments we demonstrate that a
concave hull, a connected alpha-shape without holes, of a finite planar set is
approximated by slime mould Physarum polycephalum. We represent planar points
with sources of long-distance attractants and short-distance repellents and
inoculate a piece of plasmodium outside the data set. The plasmodium moves
towards the data and envelops it by pronounced protoplasmic tubes.
"
33,Physarum Can Compute Shortest Paths,"  Physarum Polycephalum is a slime mold that is apparently able to solve
shortest path problems.
  A mathematical model has been proposed by biologists to describe the feedback
mechanism used by the slime mold to adapt its tubular channels while foraging
two food sources s0 and s1. We prove that, under this model, the mass of the
mold will eventually converge to the shortest s0 - s1 path of the network that
the mold lies on, independently of the structure of the network or of the
initial mass distribution.
  This matches the experimental observations by the biologists and can be seen
as an example of a ""natural algorithm"", that is, an algorithm developed by
evolution over millions of years.

34,QIS-XML: An Extensible Markup Language for Quantum Information Science,"  This Master thesis examines issues of interoperability and integration
between the Classic Information Science (CIS) and Quantum Information Science
(QIS). It provides a short introduction to the Extensible Markup Language (XML)
and proceeds to describe the development steps that have lead to a prototype
XML specification for quantum computing (QIS-XML). QIS-XML is a proposed
framework, based on the widely used standard (XML) to describe, visualize,
exchange and process quantum gates and quantum circuits. It also provides a
potential approach to a generic programming language for quantum computers
through the concept of XML driven compilers. Examples are provided for the
description of commonly used quantum gates and circuits, accompanied with tools
to visualize them in standard web browsers. An algorithmic example is also
presented, performing a simple addition operation with quantum circuits and
running the program on a quantum computer simulator. Overall, this initial
effort demonstrates how XML technologies could be at the core of the
architecture for describing and programming quantum computers. By leveraging a
widely accepted standard, QIS-XML also builds a bridge between classic and
quantum IT, which could foster the acceptance of QIS by the ICT community and
facilitate the understanding of quantum technology by IT experts. This would
support the consolidation of Classic Information Science and Quantum
Information Science into a Complete Information Science, a challenge that could
be referred to as the ""Information Science Grand Unification Challenge"".
"
35,An Analytical Approach for Memristive Nanoarchitectures,"  As conventional memory technologies are challenged by their technological
physical limits, emerging technologies driven by novel materials are becoming
an attractive option for future memory architectures. Among these technologies,
Resistive Memories (ReRAM) created new possibilities because of their
nano-features and unique $I$-$V$ characteristics. One particular problem that
limits the maximum array size is interference from neighboring cells due to
sneak-path currents. A possible device level solution to address this issue is
to implement a memory array using complementary resistive switches (CRS).
Although the storage mechanism for a CRS is fundamentally different from what
has been reported for memristors (low and high resistances), a CRS is simply
formed by two series bipolar memristors with opposing polarities. In this paper
our intention is to introduce modeling principles that have been previously
verified through measurements and extend the simulation principles based on
memristors to CRS devices and hence provide an analytical approach to the
design of a CRS array. The presented approach creates the necessary design
methodology platform that will assist designers in implementation of CRS
devices in future systems.

36,"Exploratory simulation of an Intelligent Iris Verifier Distributed
  System","  This paper discusses some topics related to the latest trends in the field of
evolutionary approaches to iris recognition. It presents the results of an
exploratory experimental simulation whose goal was to analyze the possibility
of establishing an Interchange Protocol for Digital Identities evolved in
different geographic locations interconnected through and into an Intelligent
Iris Verifier Distributed System (IIVDS) based on multi-enrollment. Finding a
logically consistent model for the Interchange Protocol is the key factor in
designing the future large-scale iris biometric networks. Therefore, the
logical model of such a protocol is also investigated here. All tests are made
on Bath Iris Database and prove that outstanding power of discrimination
between the intra- and the inter-class comparisons can be achieved by an IIVDS,
even when practicing 52.759.182 inter-class and 10.991.943 intra-class
comparisons. Still, the test results confirm that inconsistent enrollment can
change the logic of recognition from a fuzzified 2-valent consistent logic of
biometric certitudes to a fuzzified 3-valent inconsistent possibilistic logic
of biometric beliefs justified through experimentally determined probabilities,
or to a fuzzified 8-valent logic which is almost consistent as a biometric
theory - this quality being counterbalanced by an absolutely reasonable loss in
the user comfort level.
"
37,"Process Optimization and Downscaling of a Single Electron Single Dot
  Memory","  This paper presents the process optimization of a single-electron nanoflash
electron memory. Self-aligned single dot memory structures have been fabricated
using a wet anisotropic oxidation of a silicon nanowire. One of the main issue
was to clarify the process conditions for the dot formation. Based on the
process modeling, the influence of various parameters (oxidation temperature,
nanowire shape) has been investigated. The necessity of a sharp compromise
between these different parameters to ensure the presence of the memory dot has
been established. In order to propose an aggressive memory cell, the
downscaling of the device has been carefully studied. Scaling rules show that
the size of the original device could be reduced by a factor of 2. This point
has been previously confirmed by the realization of single-electron memory
devices.
"
38,Logic circuits from zero forcing,"  We design logic circuits based on the notion of zero forcing on graphs; each
gate of the circuits is a gadget in which zero forcing is performed. We show
that such circuits can evaluate every monotone Boolean function. By using two
vertices to encode each logical bit, we obtain universal computation. We also
highlight a phenomenon of ""back forcing"" as a property of each function. Such a
phenomenon occurs in a circuit when the input of gates which have been already
used at a given time step is further modified by a computation actually
performed at a later stage. Finally, we point out that zero forcing can be also
used to implement reversible computation. The model introduced here provides a
potentially new tool in the analysis of Boolean functions, with particular
attention to monotonicity.

39,Sub-Nyquist Sampling: Bridging Theory and Practice,"  Sampling theory encompasses all aspects related to the conversion of
continuous-time signals to discrete streams of numbers. The famous
Shannon-Nyquist theorem has become a landmark in the development of digital
signal processing. In modern applications, an increasingly number of functions
is being pushed forward to sophisticated software algorithms, leaving only
those delicate finely-tuned tasks for the circuit level.
  In this paper, we review sampling strategies which target reduction of the
ADC rate below Nyquist. Our survey covers classic works from the early 50's of
the previous century through recent publications from the past several years.
The prime focus is bridging theory and practice, that is to pinpoint the
potential of sub-Nyquist strategies to emerge from the math to the hardware. In
that spirit, we integrate contemporary theoretical viewpoints, which study
signal modeling in a union of subspaces, together with a taste of practical
aspects, namely how the avant-garde modalities boil down to concrete signal
processing systems. Our hope is that this presentation style will attract the
interest of both researchers and engineers in the hope of promoting the
sub-Nyquist premise into practical applications, and encouraging further
research into this exciting new frontier.

40,"The Life and Death of Unwanted Bits: Towards Proactive Waste Data
  Management in Digital Ecosystems","  Our everyday data processing activities create massive amounts of data. Like
physical waste and trash, unwanted and unused data also pollutes the digital
environment by degrading the performance and capacity of storage systems and
requiring costly disposal. In this paper, we propose using the lessons from
real life waste management in handling waste data. We show the impact of waste
data on the performance and operational costs of our computing systems. To
allow better waste data management, we define a waste hierarchy for digital
objects and provide insights into how to identify and categorize waste data.
Finally, we introduce novel ways of reusing, reducing, and recycling data and
software to minimize the impact of data wastage
"
41,Next Generation High Speed Computing Using Photonic Based Technolog,"  In the present era of technology computer has facilitated the human life up
to a great extent. The speed of computation has raised to astonish level but
the pace of development of other technologies which have core dependency over
computers have raised relatively exponentially huge, though the computer speed
of computation is very fast with respect to human abilities but still it has to
be increased a lot more to meet the future requirements. We have pushed
electrons to their maximum limit to a stage that nothing further could be
expected from electrons. Alternately one can use photon to replace the
relatively sluggish electrons. An alternate that posses all feature that an
electron holds but only millions of time faster and with a far more reliability
in one way or the other stretching the computers speed to a stage that no one
would have ever even wonder. In this research paper the photonics
implementations in computation industry have been presented along with its
scope as an alternate to electron with comparative study of electron and photon
under the computation perspective, generalized working of silicon based optical
computers, the application of photons and their crucial role in the upcoming
times. Keywords: Photonic Technology, H

42,"Frequency Domain Approach for Activity Classification using
  Accelerometer","  Activity classification was performed using MEMS accelerometer and wireless
sensor node for wireless sensor network environment. Three axes MEMS
accelerometer measures body's acceleration and transmits measured data with the
help of sensor node to base station attached to PC. On the PC, real time
accelerometer data is processed for movement classifications. In this paper,
Rest, walking and running are the classified activities of the person. Both
time and frequency analysis was performed to classify running and walking. The
classification of rest and movement is done using Signal magnitude area (SMA).
The classification accuracy for rest and movement is 100%. For the
classification of walk and Run two parameters i.e. SMA and Median frequency
were used. The classification accuracy for walk and running was detected as
81.25% in the experiments performed by the test persons.
"
43,A Spatial Calculus of Wrapped Compartments,"  The Calculus of Wrapped Compartments (CWC) is a recently proposed modelling
language for the representation and simulation of biological systems behaviour.
Although CWC has no explicit structure modelling a spatial geometry, its
compartment labelling feature can be exploited to model various examples of
spatial interactions in a natural way. However, specifying large networks of
compartments may require a long modelling phase. In this work we present a
surface language for CWC that provides basic constructs for modelling spatial
interactions. These constructs can be compiled away to obtain a standard CWC
model, thus exploiting the existing CWC simulation tool. A case study
concerning the modelling of Arbuscular Mychorrizal fungi growth is discussed.
"
44,Brane Calculi Systems: A Static Preview of their Possible Behaviour,"  We improve the precision of a previous Control Flow Analysis for Brane
Calculi, by adding information on the context and introducing causality
information on the membranes. This allows us to prove some biological
properties on the behaviour of systems specified in Brane Calculi.
"
45,Synchronization of P Systems with Simplex Channels,"  We solve the Firing Squad Synchronization Problem (FSSP), for P systems based
on digraphs with simplex channels, where communication is restricted by the
direction of structural arcs. Previous work on FSSP for P systems focused
exclusively on P systems with duplex channels, where communication between
parents and children is bidirectional. Our P solution, the first for simplex
channels, requires cell IDs, strongly connected digraphs and some awareness of
the local topology (such as each cell's outdegree)---we argue that these
requirements are necessary. Compared to the known solutions for cellular
automata, our solution is substantially simpler and faster.
"
46,Generalized Communicating P Systems Working in Fair Sequential Model,"  In this article we consider a new derivation mode for generalized
communicating P systems (GCPS) corresponding to the functioning of population
protocols (PP) and based on the sequential derivation mode and a fairness
condition. We show that PP can be seen as a particular variant of GCPS. We also
consider a particular stochastic evolution satisfying the fairness condition
and obtain that it corresponds to the run of a Gillespie's SSA. This permits to
further describe the dynamics of GCPS by a system of ODEs when the population
size goes to the infinity.
"
47,Multiscale Modelling: A Mobile Membrane Approach,"  Nowadays, multiscale modelling is recognized as the most suitable way to
study biological processes. Indeed, almost every phenomenon in nature exhibits
a multiscale behaviour, i.e., it is the outcome of interactions that occur at
different spatial and temporal scales. Although several ways to provide
""multilayer"" models have been proposed, only Complex Automata naturally embed
spatial information and realize the multiscale approach with well-established
inter-scale integration schemas. Recently, such approach has been restated in
terms of Spatial P systems - a variant of P systems with a more geometric
concept of space.
  In this work we discuss how mobile membranes, a variant of membrane systems
inspired by the biological movements of endocytosis and exocytosis, can be
efficaciously exploited to define a uniform multiscale coupling scheme relying
only on the features of the formalism itself.

"
50,"Memristor-based Synaptic Networks and Logical Operations Using In-Situ
  Computing","  We present new computational building blocks based on memristive devices.
These blocks, can be used to implement either supervised or unsupervised
learning modules. This is achieved using a crosspoint architecture which is an
efficient array implementation for nanoscale two-terminal memristive devices.
Based on these blocks and an experimentally verified SPICE macromodel for the
memristor, we demonstrate that firstly, the Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity
(STDP) can be implemented by a single memristor device and secondly, a
memristor-based competitive Hebbian learning through STDP using a $1\times
1000$ synaptic network. This is achieved by adjusting the memristor's
conductance values (weights) as a function of the timing difference between
presynaptic and postsynaptic spikes. These implementations have a number of
shortcomings due to the memristor's characteristics such as memory decay,
highly nonlinear switching behaviour as a function of applied voltage/current,
and functional uniformity. These shortcomings can be addressed by utilising a
mixed gates that can be used in conjunction with the analogue behaviour for
biomimetic computation. The digital implementations in this paper use in-situ
computational capability of the memristor.

51,"Slime mould solves maze in one pass ... assisted by gradient of
  chemo-attractants","  Plasmodium of Physarum polycephalum is a large cell, visible by unaided eye,
which exhibits sophisticated patterns of foraging behaviour. The plasmodium's
behaviour is well interpreted in terms of computation, where data are spatially
extended configurations of nutrients and obstacles, and results of computation
are networks of protoplasmic tubes formed by the plasmodium. In laboratory
experiments and numerical simulation we show that if plasmodium of Physarum is
inoculated in a maze's peripheral channel and an oat flake (source of
attractants) in a the maze's central chamber then the plasmodium grows toward
target oat flake and connects the flake with the site of original inoculation
with a pronounced protoplasmic tube. The protoplasmic tube represents a path in
the maze. The plasmodium solves maze in one pass because it is assisted by a
gradient of chemo-attractants propagating from the target oat flake.
"
52,Improving Ranking Using Quantum Probability,"  The paper shows that ranking information units by quantum probability differs
from ranking them by classical probability provided the same data used for
parameter estimation. As probability of detection (also known as recall or
power) and probability of false alarm (also known as fallout or size) measure
the quality of ranking, we point out and show that ranking by quantum
probability yields higher probability of detection than ranking by classical
probability provided a given probability of false alarm and the same parameter
estimation data. As quantum probability provided more effective detectors than
classical probability within other domains that data management, we conjecture
that, the system that can implement subspace-based detectors shall be more
effective than a system which implements a set-based detectors, the
effectiveness being calculated as expected recall estimated over the
probability of detection and expected fallout estimated over the probability of
false alarm.

53,Collective Adaptive Systems: Challenges Beyond Evolvability,"  This position paper overviews several challenges of collective adaptive

challenges and new research topics, but also to their impact and potential
breakthroughs in information and communication technologies.

NMR-based case study, showing which NMR parameters can be used to perform
boolean logic.

55,"Review on Feature Selection Techniques and the Impact of SVM for Cancer
  Classification using Gene Expression Profile","  The DNA microarray technology has modernized the approach of biology research
in such a way that scientists can now measure the expression levels of
thousands of genes simultaneously in a single experiment. Gene expression
profiles, which represent the state of a cell at a molecular level, have great
potential as a medical diagnosis tool. But compared to the number of genes
involved, available training data sets generally have a fairly small sample
size for classification. These training data limitations constitute a challenge
to certain classification methodologies. Feature selection techniques can be
used to extract the marker genes which influence the classification accuracy
effectively by eliminating the un wanted noisy and redundant genes This paper
presents a review of feature selection techniques that have been employed in
micro array data based cancer classification and also the predominant role of
SVM for cancer classification.
"
56,A Study of Computer-Based Simulations for Nano-Systems and their types,"  In most of the cases, the experimental study of Nanotechnology involves high
cost for Laboratory set-up and the experimentation processes were also slow.
So, one cannot rely on experimental nanotechnology alone. As such, the
Computer-Based molecular simulations and modeling are one of the foundations of
computational nanotechnology. The computer based modeling and simulations were
also referred as computational experimentations. In real experiments, the
investigator doesn't have full control over the experiment. But, in
Computational experimentation the investigator have full control over the
experiment. The accuracy of such Computational nano-technology based experiment
generally depends on the accuracy of the following things: Intermolecular
interaction, Numerical models and Simulation schemes used. Once the accuracy of
the Computational Scheme is guaranteed one can use that to investigate various
nonlinear interactions whose results are completely unexpected and unforeseen.
Apart from it, numerical modeling and computer based simulations also help to
understand the theoretical part of the nano-science involved in the
nano-system. They allow us to develop useful analytic and predictive models. In
this paper, a brief study of Computer-Based- Simulation techniques as well as
some Experimental result obtained using it were given.
"
57,Monitoring Breathing via Signal Strength in Wireless Networks,"  This paper shows experimentally that standard wireless networks which measure
received signal strength (RSS) can be used to reliably detect human breathing
and estimate the breathing rate, an application we call ""BreathTaking"". We show
that although an individual link cannot reliably detect breathing, the
collective spectral content of a network of devices reliably indicates the
presence and rate of breathing. We present a maximum likelihood estimator (MLE)
of breathing rate, amplitude, and phase, which uses the RSS data from many
links simultaneously. We show experimental results which demonstrate that
reliable detection and frequency estimation is possible with 30 seconds of
data, within 0.3 breaths per minute (bpm) RMS error. Use of directional
antennas is shown to improve robustness to motion near the network.
"
58,Empirical study of sensor observation services server instances,"  The number of Sensor Observation Service (SOS) instances available online has
been increasing in the last few years. The SOS specification standardises
interfaces and data formats for exchanging sensor-related in-formation between
information providers and consumers. SOS in conjunction with other
specifications in the Sensor Web Enablement initiative, at-tempts to realise
the Sensor Web vision, a worldwide system where sensor networks of any kind are
interconnected. In this paper we present an empirical study of actual instances
of servers implementing SOS. The study focuses mostly in which parts of the
specification are more frequently included in real implementations, and how
exchanged messages follows the structure defined by XML Schema files. Our
findings can be of practical use when implementing servers and clients based on
the SOS specification, as they can be optimized for common scenarios.
"
59,More powerful biomolecular computers,"  Biomolecular computers, along with quantum computers, may be a future
alternative for traditional, silicon-based computers. Main advantages of
biomolecular computers are massive parallel processing of data, expanded
capacity of storing information and compatibility with living organisms (first
attempts of using biomolecular computers in cancer therapy through blocking of
improper genetic information are described in Benenson et al.(2004). However,
biomolecular computers have several drawbacks including time-consuming
procedures of preparing of input, problems in detecting output signals and
interference with by-products. Due to these obstacles, there are few laboratory
implementations of theoretically designed DNA computers (like the Turing
machine and pushdown automaton), but there are many implementations of DNA
computers for particular problems. The first practical laboratory
implementation of the general theoretical model of a machine performing
DNA-based calculations was a simple two-symbol two-state finite automaton
established by Benenson et al.(2001). In the present work, we propose a new
attitude, extending the capability of DNA-based finite automaton, by employing
two or potentially more restriction enzymes instead of one used in other works.
This creates an opportunity to implement in laboratories of more complex finite
automata and other theoretical models of computers: pushdown automata, Turing
machines.
"
60,"Simulation and Optimization of MQW based optical modulator for on chip
  optical interconnect","  Optical interconnects are foreseen as a potential solution to improve the
performance of data transmission in high speed integrated circuits since
electrical interconnects operating at high bit rates have several limitations
which creates a bottleneck at the interconnect level. The objective of the work
is to model and then simulate the MQWM based optical interconnect transmitter.
The power output of the simulated modulator is then optimized with respect to
various parameters namely contrast ratio, insertion loss and bias current. The
methodology presented here is suitable for investigation of both analog and
digital modulation performance but it primarily deals with digital modulation.
We have not included the effect of carrier charge density in multiple quantum
well simulation.
"
61,"A Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Implementation of a Classical Deutsch-Jozsa
  Algorithm","  Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) has been widely used as a demonstrative
medium for showcasing the ability for quantum computations to outperform
classical ones. A large number of such experiments performed have been
implementations of the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm. It is known, however, that in
some cases the Deutsch-Jozsa problem can be solved classically using as many
queries to the black-box as in the quantum solution. In this paper we describe
experiments in which we take the contrasting approach of using NMR as a
classical computing medium, treating the nuclear spin vectors classically and
utilising an alternative embedding of bits into the physical medium. This
allows us to determine the actual Boolean function computed by the black-box
for the n=1,2 cases, as opposed to only the nature (balanced or constant) as
conventional quantum algorithms do. Discussion of these experiments leads to
some clarification of the complications surrounding the comparison of different
quantum algorithms, particularly black-box type algorithms.
"
62,Memristors can implement fuzzy logic,"  In our work we propose implementing fuzzy logic using memristors. Min and max
operations are done by antipodally configured memristor circuits that may be
assembled into computational circuits. We discuss computational power of such
circuits with respect to m-efficiency and experimentally observed behavior of
memristive devices. Circuits implemented with real devices are likely to
manifest learning behavior. The circuits presented in the work may be
applicable for instance in fuzzy classifiers.
"
63,Power aware physical model for 3d IC's,"  In this work we have proposed a geometric model that is employed to devise a
scheme for identifying the hotspots and zones in a chip. These spots or zone
need to be guarded thermally to ensure performance and reliability of the chip.
The model namely continuous unit sphere model has been presented taking into
account that the 3D region of the chip is uniform, thereby reflecting on the
possible locations of heat sources and the target observation points. The
experimental results for the - continuous domain establish that a region which
does not contain any heat sources may become hotter than the regions containing
the thermal sources. Thus a hotspot may appear away from the active sources,
and placing heat sinks on the active thermal sources alone may not suffice to
tackle thermal imbalance. Power management techniques aid in obtaining a
uniform power profile throughout the chip, but we propose an algorithm using
minimum bipartite matching where we try to move the sources minimally (with
minimum perturbation in the chip floor plan) near cooler points (blocks) to
obtain a uniform power profile due to diffusion of heat from hotter point to
cooler ones.
"
64,Synthesis and Optimization of Reversible Circuits - A Survey,"  Reversible logic circuits have been historically motivated by theoretical
research in low-power electronics as well as practical improvement of
bit-manipulation transforms in cryptography and computer graphics. Recently,
reversible circuits have attracted interest as components of quantum
algorithms, as well as in photonic and nano-computing technologies where some
switching devices offer no signal gain. Research in generating reversible logic
distinguishes between circuit synthesis, post-synthesis optimization, and
technology mapping. In this survey, we review algorithmic paradigms ---
search-based, cycle-based, transformation-based, and BDD-based --- as well as
specific algorithms for reversible synthesis, both exact and heuristic. We
conclude the survey by outlining key open challenges in synthesis of reversible
and quantum logic, as well as most common misconceptions.
"
65,A Theory of Consciousness Founded on Neurons That Behave Like Qubits,"  This paper presents a hypothesis that consciousness is a natural result of
neurons that become connected recursively, and work synchronously between short
and long term memories. Such neurons demonstrate qubit-like properties, each
supporting a probabilistic combination of true and false at a given phase.
Advantages of qubits include probabilistic modifications of cues for searching
associations in long term memory, and controlled toggling for parallel,
reversible computations to prioritize multiple recalls and to facilitate
mathematical abilities.
"
66,"Parallel Algorithms for DNA Probe Placement on Small Oligonucleotide
  Arrays","  Oligonucleotide arrays are used in a wide range of genomic analyses, such as
gene expression profiling, comparative genomic hybridization, chromatin
immunoprecipitation, SNP detection, etc. During fabrication, the sites of an
oligonucleotide array are selectively exposed to light in order to activate
oligonucleotides for further synthesis. Optical effects can cause unwanted
illumination at masked sites that are adjacent to the sites intentionally
exposed to light. This results in synthesis of unforeseen sequences in masked
sites and compromises interpretation of experimental data. To reduce such
uncertainty, one can exploit freedom in how probes are assigned to array sites.
The border length minimization problem (BLMP) seeks a placement of probes that
minimizes the sum of border lengths in all masks. In this paper, we propose two
parallel algorithms for the BLMP. The proposed parallel algorithms have the
local-search paradigm at their core, and are especially developed for the BLMP.
The results reported show that, for small microarrays with at most 1156 probes,
the proposed parallel algorithms perform better than the best previous
algorithms.
"
67,Massively parallel computing on an organic molecular layer,"  Current computers operate at enormous speeds of ~10^13 bits/s, but their
principle of sequential logic operation has remained unchanged since the 1950s.
Though our brain is much slower on a per-neuron base (~10^3 firings/s), it is
capable of remarkable decision-making based on the collective operations of
millions of neurons at a time in ever-evolving neural circuitry. Here we use
molecular switches to build an assembly where each molecule communicates-like
neurons-with many neighbors simultaneously. The assembly's ability to
reconfigure itself spontaneously for a new problem allows us to realize
conventional computing constructs like logic gates and Voronoi decompositions,
as well as to reproduce two natural phenomena: heat diffusion and the mutation
of normal cells to cancer cells. This is a shift from the current static
computing paradigm of serial bit-processing to a regime in which a large number
of bits are processed in parallel in dynamically changing hardware.
"
68,Semi-optimal Practicable Algorithmic Cooling,"  Algorithmic Cooling (AC) of spins applies entropy manipulation algorithms in
open spin-systems in order to cool spins far beyond Shannon's entropy bound. AC
of nuclear spins was demonstrated experimentally, and may contribute to nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Several cooling algorithms were
suggested in recent years, including practicable algorithmic cooling (PAC) and
exhaustive AC. Practicable algorithms have simple implementations, yet their
level of cooling is far from optimal; Exhaustive algorithms, on the other hand,
cool much better, and some even reach (asymptotically) an optimal level of
cooling, but they are not practicable. We introduce here semi-optimal
practicable AC (SOPAC), wherein few cycles (typically 2-6) are performed at
each recursive level. Two classes of SOPAC algorithms are proposed and
analyzed. Both attain cooling levels significantly better than PAC, and are
much more efficient than the exhaustive algorithms. The new algorithms are
shown to bridge the gap between PAC and exhaustive AC. In addition, we
calculated the number of spins required by SOPAC in order to purify qubits for
quantum computation. As few as 12 and 7 spins are required (in an ideal
scenario) to yield a mildly pure spin (60% polarized) from initial
polarizations of 1% and 10%, respectively. In the latter case, about five more
spins are sufficient to produce a highly pure spin (99.99% polarized), which
could be relevant for fault-tolerant quantum computing.
"
69,Synthesis of Quantum Circuits for Linear Nearest Neighbor Architectures,"  While a couple of impressive quantum technologies have been proposed, they
have several intrinsic limitations which must be considered by circuit
designers to produce realizable circuits. Limited interaction distance between
gate qubits is one of the most common limitations. In this paper, we suggest
extensions of the existing synthesis flow aimed to realize circuits for quantum
architectures with linear nearest neighbor (LNN) interaction. To this end, a
template matching optimization, an exact synthesis approach, and two reordering
strategies are introduced. The proposed methods are combined as an integrated
synthesis flow. Experiments show that by using the suggested flow, quantum cost
can be improved by more than 50% on average.
"
70,"Spectrally and Spatially Configurable Superlenses for Optoplasmonic
  Nanocircuits","  Energy transfer between photons and molecules and between neighboring
molecules is ubiquitous in living nature, most prominently in photosynthesis.
While energy transfer is efficiently utilized by living systems, its adoption
to connect individual components in man-made plasmonic nanocircuits has been
challenged by low transfer efficiencies which motivate the development of
entirely new concepts for energy transfer. We introduce herein optoplasmonic
superlenses that combine the capability of optical microcavities to insulate
molecule-photon systems from decohering environmental effects with the superior
light nanoconcentration properties of nanoantennas. The proposed structures
provide significant enhancement of the emitter radiative rate and efficient
long-range transfer of emitted photons followed by subsequent re-focusing into
nanoscale volumes accessible to near- and far-field detection. Optoplasmonic
superlenses are versatile building blocks for optoplasmonic nanocircuits and
can be used to construct ""dark"" single molecule sensors, resonant amplifiers,
nanoconcentrators, frequency multiplexers, demultiplexers, energy converters
and dynamical switches.
"
71,Thermally induced error: density limit for magnetic data storage,"  Magnetic data storage is pervasive in the preservation of digital information
and the rapid pace of computer development requires ever more capacity.
Increasing the storage density for magnetic hard disk drives requires a reduced
bit size, previously thought to be limited by the thermal stability of the
constituent magnetic grains. The limiting storage density in magnetic recording
is investigated treating the writing of bits as a thermodynamic process. A
'thermal writability' factor is introduced and it is shown that storage
densities will be limited to 15 to 20 TBit/in^2 unless technology can move
beyond the currently available write field magnitudes.
"
72,On Three Challenges of Artificial Living Systems and Embodied Evolution,"  Creating autonomous, self-supporting, self-replicating, sustainable systems
is a great challenge. To some extent, understanding life means not only being
able to create it from scratch, but also improving, supporting, saving it, or
even making it even more advanced. This can be thought of as a long-term goal
of living technologies and embodied evolution. Current research agenda targets
several short- and middle-term steps towards achieving such a vision:
connection of ICT and bio-/chemo- developments, advances in ""soft"" and ""wet""
robotics, integration of material science into developmental robotics, and
potentially, addressing the self-replication in autonomous systems.
"
73,Beating the Landauer's limit by trading energy with uncertainty,"  According to the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors in the
next 10-15 years the limits imposed by the physics of switch operation will be
the major roadblock for future scaling of the CMOS technology. Among these
limits the most fundamental is represented by the so-called Shannon-von
Neumann-Landauer limit that sets a lower bound to the minimum heat dissipated
per bit erasing operation. Here we show that in a nanoscale switch, operated at
finite temperature T, this limit can be beaten by trading the dissipated energy
with the uncertainty in the distinguishability of switch logic states. We
establish a general relation between the minimum required energy and the
maximum error rate in the switch operation and briefly discuss the potential
applications in the design of future switches.
"
74,"Computing with Liquid Crystal Fingers: Models of geometric and logical
  computation","  When a voltage is applied across a thin layer of cholesteric liquid crystal,
fingers of cholesteric alignment can form and propagate in the layer. In
computer simulation, based on experimental laboratory results, we demonstrate
that these cholesteric fingers can solve selected problems of computational
geometry, logic and arithmetics. We show that branching fingers approximate a
planar Voronoi diagram, and non-branching fingers produce a convex subdivision
of concave polygons. We also provide a detailed blue-print and simulation of a
one-bit half-adder functioning on the principles of collision-based computing,
where the implementation is via collision of liquid crystal fingers with
obstacles and other fingers.
"
75,"Phenomenology of retained refractoriness: On semi-memristive discrete
  media","  We study two-dimensional cellular automata, each cell takes three states:
resting, excited and refractory. A resting cell excites if number of excited
neighbours lies in a certain interval (excitation interval). An excited cell
become refractory independently on states of its neighbours. A refractory cell
returns to a resting state only if the number of excited neighbours belong to
recovery interval. The model is an excitable cellular automaton abstraction of
a spatially extended semi-memristive medium where a cell's resting state
symbolises low-resistance and refractory state high-resistance. The medium is
semi-memristive because only transition from high- to low-resistance is
controlled by density of local excitation. We present phenomenological
classification of the automata behaviour for all possible excitation intervals
and recovery intervals. We describe eleven classes of cellular automata with
retained refractoriness based on criteria of space-filling ratio, morphological
and generative diversity, and types of travelling localisations.
"
76,Robustness Analysis for Battery Supported Cyber-Physical Systems,"  This paper establishes a novel analytical approach to quantify robustness of
scheduling and battery management for battery supported cyber-physical systems.
A dynamic schedulability test is introduced to determine whether tasks are
schedulable within a finite time window. The test is used to measure robustness
of a real-time scheduling algorithm by evaluating the strength of computing
time perturbations that break schedulability at runtime. Robustness of battery
management is quantified analytically by an adaptive threshold on the state of
charge. The adaptive threshold significantly reduces the false alarm rate for
battery management algorithms to decide when a battery needs to be replaced.
"
77,Optoelectronic Reservoir Computing,"  Reservoir computing is a recently introduced, highly efficient bio-inspired
approach for processing time dependent data. The basic scheme of reservoir
computing consists of a non linear recurrent dynamical system coupled to a
single input layer and a single output layer. Within these constraints many
implementations are possible. Here we report an opto-electronic implementation
of reservoir computing based on a recently proposed architecture consisting of
a single non linear node and a delay line. Our implementation is sufficiently
fast for real time information processing. We illustrate its performance on
tasks of practical importance such as nonlinear channel equalization and speech
recognition, and obtain results comparable to state of the art digital
implementations.
"
78,"Linear Nearest Neighbor Synthesis of Reversible Circuits by Graph
  Partitioning","  Linear Nearest Neighbor (LNN) synthesis in reversible circuits has emerged as
an important issue in terms of technological implementation for quantum
computation. The objective is to obtain a LNN architecture with minimum gate
cost. As achieving optimal synthesis is a hard problem, heuristic methods have
been proposed in recent literature. In this work we present a graph
partitioning based approach for LNN synthesis with reduction in circuit cost.
In particular, the number of SWAP gates required to convert a given gate-level
quantum circuit to its equivalent LNN configuration is minimized. Our algorithm
determines the reordering of indices of the qubit line(s) for both single
control and multiple controlled gates. Experimental results for placing the
target qubits of Multiple Controlled Toffoli (MCT) library of benchmark
circuits show a significant reduction in gate count and quantum gate cost
compared to those of related research works.
"
79,Stabilizer States as a Basis for Density Matrices,"  We show that the space of density matrices for n-qubit states, considered as
a (2^n)^2 dimensional real vector space, has a basis consisting of density
matrices of stabilizer states. We describe an application of this result to
automated verification of quantum protocols.
"
80,Circuit Theory for SPICE of Spintronic Integrated Circuits,"  We present a theoretical and a numerical formalism for analysis and design of
spintronic integrated circuits (SPINICs). The formalism encompasses a
generalized circuit theory for spintronic integrated circuits based on
nanomagnetic dynamics and spin transport. We propose an extension to the
Modified Nodal Analysis technique for the analysis of spin circuits based on
the recently developed spin conduction matrices. We demonstrate the
applicability of the framework using an example spin logic circuit described
using spin Netlists.

81,"A memristive nanoparticle/organic hybrid synapstor for neuro-inspired
  computing","  A large effort is devoted to the research of new computing paradigms
associated to innovative nanotechnologies that should complement and/or propose
alternative solutions to the classical Von Neumann/CMOS association. Among
various propositions, Spiking Neural Network (SNN) seems a valid candidate. (i)
In terms of functions, SNN using relative spike timing for information coding
are deemed to be the most effective at taking inspiration from the brain to
allow fast and efficient processing of information for complex tasks in
recognition or classification. (ii) In terms of technology, SNN may be able to
benefit the most from nanodevices, because SNN architectures are intrinsically
tolerant to defective devices and performance variability. Here we demonstrate
Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP), a basic and primordial learning
function in the brain, with a new class of synapstor (synapse-transistor),
called Nanoparticle Organic Memory Field Effect Transistor (NOMFET). We show
that this learning function is obtained with a simple hybrid material made of
the self-assembly of gold nanoparticles and organic semiconductor thin films.
Beyond mimicking biological synapses, we also demonstrate how the shape of the
applied spikes can tailor the STDP learning function. Moreover, the experiments
and modeling show that this synapstor is a memristive device. Finally, these
synapstors are successfully coupled with a CMOS platform emulating the pre- and
post-synaptic neurons, and a behavioral macro-model is developed on usual
device simulator.

82,Fuzzy cellular model for on-line traffic simulation,"  This paper introduces a fuzzy cellular model of road traffic that was
intended for on-line applications in traffic control. The presented model uses
fuzzy sets theory to deal with uncertainty of both input data and simulation
results. Vehicles are modelled individually, thus various classes of them can
be taken into consideration. In the proposed approach, all parameters of
vehicles are described by means of fuzzy numbers. The model was implemented in
a simulation of vehicles queue discharge process. Changes of the queue length
were analysed in this experiment and compared to the results of NaSch cellular
automata model.
"
83,Teaching Memory Circuit Elements via Experiment-Based Learning,"  The class of memory circuit elements which comprises memristive,
memcapacitive, and meminductive systems, is gaining considerable attention in a
broad range of disciplines. This is due to the enormous flexibility these
elements provide in solving diverse problems in analog/neuromorphic and
digital/quantum computation; the possibility to use them in an integrated
computing-memory paradigm, massively-parallel solution of different
optimization problems, learning, neural networks, etc. The time is therefore
ripe to introduce these elements to the next generation of physicists and
engineers with appropriate teaching tools that can be easily implemented in
undergraduate teaching laboratories. In this paper, we suggest the use of
easy-to-build emulators to provide a hands-on experience for the students to
learn the fundamental properties and realize several applications of these
memelements. We provide explicit examples of problems that could be tackled
with these emulators that range in difficulty from the demonstration of the
basic properties of memristive, memcapacitive, and meminductive systems to
logic/computation and cross-bar memory. The emulators can be built from
off-the-shelf components, with a total cost of a few tens of dollars, thus
providing a relatively inexpensive platform for the implementation of these
exercises in the classroom. We anticipate that this experiment-based learning
can be easily adopted and expanded by the instructors with many more case
studies.
"
84,"Optimal Inverter VAR Control in Distribution Systems with High PV
  Penetration","  The intent of the study detailed in this paper is to demonstrate the benefits
of inverter var control on a fast timescale to mitigate rapid and large voltage
fluctuations due to the high penetration of photovoltaic generation and the
resulting reverse power flow. Our approach is to formulate the volt/var control
as a radial optimal power flow (OPF) problem to minimize line losses and energy
consumption, subject to constraints on voltage magnitudes. An efficient
solution to the radial OPF problem is presented and used to study the structure
of optimal inverter var injection and the net benefits, taking into account the
additional cost of inverter losses when operating at non-unity power factor.
This paper will illustrate how, depending on the circuit topology and its
loading condition, the inverter's optimal reactive power injection is not
necessarily monotone with respect to their real power output. The results are
demonstrated on a distribution feeder on the Southern California Edison system
that has a very light load and a 5 MW photovoltaic (PV) system installed away
from the substation.
"
85,Temporal Psychovisual Modulation: a new paradigm of information display,"  We report on a new paradigm of information display that greatly extends the
utility and versatility of current optoelectronic displays. The main innovation
is to let a display of high refresh rate optically broadcast so-called atom
frames, which are designed through non-negative matrix factorization to form
bases for a class of images, and different viewers perceive selfintended images
by using display-synchronized viewing devices and their own human visual
systems to fuse appropriately weighted atom frames. This work is essentially a
scheme of temporal psychovisual modulation in visible spectrum, using an
optoelectronic modulator coupled with a biological demodulator.
"
86,A New Full Adder Cell for Molecular Electronics,"  Due to high power consumption and difficulties with minimizing the CMOS
transistor size, molecular electronics has been introduced as an emerging
technology. Further, there have been noticeable advances in fabrication of
molecular wires and switches and also molecular diodes can be used for
designing different logic circuits. Considering this novel technology, we use
molecules as the active components of the circuit, for transporting electric
charge. In this paper, a full adder cell based on molecular electronics is
presented. This full adder is consisted of resonant tunneling diodes and
transistors which are implemented via molecular electronics. The area occupied
by this kind of full adder would be much times smaller than the conventional
designs and it can be used as the building block of more complex molecular
arithmetic circuits.
"
87,"A Novel Methodology for Thermal Aware Silicon Area Estimation for 2D &
  3D MPSoCs","  In a multiprocessor system on chip (MPSoC) IC the processor is one of the
highest heat dissipating devices. The temperature generated in an IC may vary
with floor plan of the chip. This paper proposes an integration and thermal
analysis methodology to extract the peak temperature and temperature
distribution of 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional multiprocessor system-on-chip.
As we know the peak temperature of chip increases in 3-dimensional structures
compared to 2-dimensional ones due to the reduced space in intra-layer and
inter-layer components. In sub-nanometre scale technologies, it is inevitable
to analysis the heat developed in individual chip to extract the temperature
distribution of the entire chip. With the technology scaling in new generation
ICs more and more components are integrated to a smaller area. Along with the
other parameters threshold voltage is also scaled down which results in
exponential increase in leakage current. This has resulted in rise in hotspot
temperature value due to increase in leakage power. In this paper, we have
analysed the temperature developed in an IC with four identical processors at
2.4 GHz in different floorplans. The analysis has been done for both 2D and 3D
arrangements. In the 3D arrangement, a three layered structure has been
considered with two Silicon layers and a thermal interface material (TIM) in
between them. Based on experimental results the paper proposes a methodology to
reduce the peak temperature developed in 2D and 3D integrated circuits .
"
88,Cognitive Memory Network,"  A resistive memory network that has no crossover wiring is proposed to
overcome the hardware limitations to size and functional complexity that is
associated with conventional analogue neural networks. The proposed memory
network is based on simple network cells that are arranged in a hierarchical
modular architecture. Cognitive functionality of this network is demonstrated
by an example of character recognition. The network is trained by an
evolutionary process to completely recognise characters deformed by random
noise, rotation, scaling and shifting
"
89,A Neuron Based Switch: Application to Low Power Mixed Signal Circuits,"  Human brain is functionally and physically complex. This 'complexity' can be
seen as a result of biological design process involving extensive use of
concepts such as modularity and hierarchy. Over the past decade, deeper
insights into the functioning of cortical neurons have led to the development
of models that can be implemented in hardware. The implementation of
biologically inspired spiking neuron networks in silicon can provide solutions
to difficult cognitive tasks. The work reported in this paper is an application
of a VLSI cortical neuron model for low power design. The VLSI implementation
shown in this paper is based on the spike and burst firing pattern of cortex
and follows the Izhikevich neuron model. This model is applied to a DC
differential amplifier as practical application of power reduction
"
90,"Cross-point architecture for spin transfer torque magnetic random access
  memory","  Spin transfer torque magnetic random access memory (STT-MRAM) is considered
as one of the most promising candidates to build up a true universal memory
thanks to its fast write/read speed, infinite endurance and non-volatility.
However the conventional access architecture based on 1 transistor + 1 memory
cell limits its storage density as the selection transistor should be large
enough to ensure the write current higher than the critical current for the STT
operation. This paper describes a design of cross-point architecture for
STT-MRAM. The mean area per word corresponds to only two transistors, which are
shared by a number of bits (e.g. 64). This leads to significant improvement of
data density (e.g. 1.75 F2/bit). Special techniques are also presented to
address the sneak currents and low speed issues of conventional cross-point
architecture, which are difficult to surmount and few efficient design
solutions have been reported in the literature. By using a STT-MRAM SPICE model
including precise experimental parameters and STMicroelectronics 65 nm
technology, some chip characteristic results such as cell area, data access
speed and power have been calculated or simulated to demonstrate the expected
performances of this new memory architecture.
"
91,Informed Source Separation using Iterative Reconstruction,"  This paper presents a technique for Informed Source Separation (ISS) of a
single channel mixture, based on the Multiple Input Spectrogram Inversion
method. The reconstruction of the source signals is iterative, alternating
between a time- frequency consistency enforcement and a re-mixing constraint. A
dual resolution technique is also proposed, for sharper transients
reconstruction. The two algorithms are compared to a state-of-the-art
Wiener-based ISS technique, on a database of fourteen monophonic mixtures, with
standard source separation objective measures. Experimental results show that
the proposed algorithms outperform both this reference technique and the oracle
Wiener filter by up to 3dB in distortion, at the cost of a significantly
heavier computation.
"
92,"Asynchronous Signal Passing for Tile Self-Assembly: Fuel Efficient
  Computation and Efficient Assembly of Shapes","  In this paper we demonstrate the power of a model of tile self-assembly based
on active glues which can dynamically change state. We formulate the
Signal-passing Tile Assembly Model (STAM), based on the model of Padilla, Liu,
and Seeman to be asynchronous, allowing any action of turning a glue on or off,
attaching a new tile, or breaking apart an assembly to happen in any order.
Within this highly generalized model we provide three new solutions to tile
self-assembly problems that have been addressed within the abstract Tile
Assembly Model and its variants, showing that signal passing tiles allow for
substantial improvement across multiple complexity metrics. Our first result
utilizes a recursive assembly process to achieve tile-type efficient assembly
of linear structures, using provably fewer tile types than what is possible in
standard tile assembly models. Our second system of signal-passing tiles
simulates any Turing machine with high fuel efficiency by using only a constant
number of tiles per computation step. Our third system assembles the discrete
Sierpinski triangle, demonstrating that this pattern can be strictly
self-assembled within the STAM. This result is of particular interest in that
it is known that this pattern cannot self-assemble within a number of well
studied tile self-assembly models. Notably, all of our constructions are at
temperature 1, further demonstrating that signal-passing confers the power to
bypass many restrictions found in standard tile assembly models.
"
93,"Constant-Optimized Quantum Circuits for Modular Multiplication and
  Exponentiation","  Reversible circuits for modular multiplication $Cx$%$M$ with $x<M$ arise as
components of modular exponentiation in Shor's quantum number-factoring
algorithm. However, existing generic constructions focus on asymptotic gate
count and circuit depth rather than actual values, producing fairly large
circuits not optimized for specific $C$ and $M$ values. In this work, we
develop such optimizations in a bottom-up fashion, starting with most
convenient $C$ values. When zero-initialized ancilla registers are available,
we reduce the search for compact circuits to a shortest-path problem. Some of
our modular-multiplication circuits are asymptotically smaller than previous
constructions, but worst-case bounds and average sizes remain $\Theta(n^2)$. In
the context of modular exponentiation, we offer several constant-factor
improvements, as well as an improvement by a constant additive term that is
significant for few-qubit circuits arising in ongoing laboratory experiments
with Shor's algorithm.
"
94,"Thermal analysis & optimization of a 3 dimensional heterogeneous
  structure","  Besides the lot of advantages offered by the 3D stacking of devices in an
integrated circuit there is a chance of device damage due to rise in peak
temperature value. Hence, in order to make use of all the potential benefits of
the vertical stacking a thermal aware design is very essential. The first step
for designing a thermal aware architecture is to analyze the hotspot
temperature generated by the devices. In this paper we are presenting the
results of our thermal analysis experiments of a 3D heterogeneous structure
with three layers. The bottom layer had eight identical processors at 2.4 GHz
and the top layer was with four memory units. The intermediate layer was a
thermal interface material (TIM). The 2D thermal analysis of the top and bottom
layers was also done separately. In the next step simulations were carried out
by varying TIM thickness and conductivity to study its affect on hotspot
temperature so as to optimize the temperature distribution.
"
95,Design and modelling of different SRAM's based on CNTFET 32nm technology,"  Carbon nanotube field-effect transistor (CNTFET) refers to a field-effect
transistor that utilizes a single carbon nanotube or an array of carbon
nanotubes as the channel material instead of bulk silicon in the traditional
MOSFET structure. Since it was first demonstrated in 1998, there have been
tremendous developments in CNTFETs, which promise for an alternative material
to replace silicon in future electronics. Carbon nanotubes are promising
materials for the nano-scale electron devices such as nanotube FETs for
ultra-high density integrated circuits and quantum-effect devices for novel
intelligent circuits, which are expected to bring a breakthrough in the present
silicon technology.
  A Static Random Access Memory (SRAM) is designed to plug two needs: i) The
SRAM provides as cache memory, communicating between central processing unit
and Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM). ii) The SRAM technology act as driving
force for low power application since SRAM is portable compared to DRAM, and
SRAM doesn't require any refresh current. On the basis of acquired knowledge,
we present different SRAM's designed for the conventional CNTFET. HSPICE
simulations of this circuit using Stanford CNTFET model shows a great
improvement in power saving.
"
96,Are motorways rational from slime mould's point of view?,"  We analyse the results of our experimental laboratory approximation of
motorways networks with slime mould Physarum polycephalum. Motorway networks of
fourteen geographical areas are considered: Australia, Africa, Belgium, Brazil,
Canada, China, Germany, Iberia, Italy, Malaysia, Mexico, The Netherlands, UK,
USA. For each geographical entity we represented major urban areas by oat
flakes and inoculated the slime mould in a capital. After slime mould spanned
all urban areas with a network of its protoplasmic tubes we extracted a
generalised Physarum graph from the network and compared the graphs with an
abstract motorway graph using most common measures. The measures employed are
the number of independent cycles, cohesion, shortest paths lengths, diameter,
the Harary index and the Randic index. We obtained a series of intriguing
results, and found that the slime mould approximates best of all the motorway
graphs of Belgium, Canada and China, and that for all entities studied the best
match between Physarum and motorway graphs is detected by the Randic index
(molecular branching index).
"
97,"Numerical computations and mathematical modelling with infinite and
  infinitesimal numbers","  Traditional computers work with finite numbers. Situations where the usage of
infinite or infinitesimal quantities is required are studied mainly
theoretically. In this paper, a recently introduced computational methodology
(that is not related to the non-standard analysis) is used to work with finite,
infinite, and infinitesimal numbers \textit{numerically}. This can be done on a
new kind of a computer - the Infinity Computer - able to work with all these
types of numbers. The new computational tools both give possibilities to
execute computations of a new type and open new horizons for creating new
mathematical models where a computational usage of infinite and/or
infinitesimal numbers can be useful. A number of numerical examples showing the
potential of the new approach and dealing with divergent series, limits,
probability theory, linear algebra, and calculation of volumes of objects
consisting of parts of different dimensions are given.
"
98,Higher order numerical differentiation on the Infinity Computer,"  There exist many applications where it is necessary to approximate
numerically derivatives of a function which is given by a computer procedure.
In particular, all the fields of optimization have a special interest in such a
kind of information. In this paper, a new way to do this is presented for a new
kind of a computer -- the Infinity Computer -- able to work numerically with
finite, infinite, and infinitesimal numbers. It is proved that the Infinity
Computer is able to calculate values of derivatives of a higher order for a
wide class of functions represented by computer procedures. It is shown that
the ability to compute derivatives of arbitrary order automatically and
accurate to working precision is an intrinsic property of the Infinity Computer
related to its way of functioning. Numerical examples illustrating the new
concepts and numerical tools are given.
"
99,Methodology of Numerical Computations with Infinities and Infinitesimals,"  A recently developed computational methodology for executing numerical
calculations with infinities and infinitesimals is described in this paper. The
developed approach has a pronounced applied character and is based on the
principle `The part is less than the whole' introduced by Ancient Greeks. This
principle is used with respect to all numbers (finite, infinite, and
infinitesimal) and to all sets and processes (finite and infinite). The point
of view on infinities and infinitesimals (and in general, on Mathematics)
presented in this paper uses strongly physical ideas emphasizing interrelations
holding between a mathematical object under the observation and tools used for
this observation. It is shown how a new numeral system allowing one to express
different infinite and infinitesimal quantities in a unique framework can be
used for theoretical and computational purposes. Numerous examples dealing with
infinite sets, divergent series, limits, and probability theory are given.

  Estimation for the Cross Layer based Cognitive Radio Networks","  Secured opportunistic Medium Access Control (MAC) and complexity reduction in
channel estimation are proposed in the Cross layer design Cognitive Radio
Networks deploying the secured dynamic channel allocation from the endorsed
channel reservation. Channel Endorsement and Transmission policy is deployed to
optimize the free channel selection as well as channel utilization to cognitive
radio users. This strategy provide the secured and reliable link to secondary
users as well as the collision free link to primary users between the physical
and MAC layers which yields the better network performance. On the other hand,
Complexity Reduction in Minimum Mean Square Errror (CR-MMSE) and Maximum
Likelihood (CR-ML) algorithm on Decision Directed Channel Estimation (DDCE) is
deployed significantly to achieve computational complexity as Least Square (LS)
method. Rigorously, CR-MMSE in sample spaced channel impulse response (SS-CIR)
is implemented by allowing the computationally inspired matrix inversion.
Regarding CR-ML, Pilot Symbol Assisted Modulation (PSAM) with DDCE is
implemented such the pilot symbol sequence provides the significant performance
gain in frequency correlation using the finite delay spread. It is found that
CRMMSE demonstrates outstanding Symbol Error Rate (SER) performance over MMSE
and LS, and CR-ML over MMSE and ML.

101,"Automation of Mobile Pick and Place Robotic System for Small Food
  Industry","  The use of robotics in food industry is becoming more popular in recent
years. The trend seems to continue as long as the robotics technology meets
diverse and challenging needs of the food producers. Rapid developments in
digital computers and control systems technologies have significant impact in
robotics like any other engineering fields. By utilizing new hardware and
software tools, design of these complex systems that need strong integration of
distinct disciplines is no longer difficult compared to the past. Therefore,
the purpose of this paper is to design and implement a micro-controller based
on reliable and high performance robotic system for food / biscuit

baking it picks the biscuits tray from the furnace. A special gripper is
designed to pick and place the biscuits tray with flexibility.

102,Intra-bodyhybrid communication scheme for healthcare systems,"  Intra-body communication (IBC) is a type of Body Area Network (BAN)that
utilizes human body as the medium for data transmission. Thelow power
requirements of intra-body communication (IBC) as compared to near field
electromagnetic waves showed that it can be a suitable solution for Medical
Body Area Networks (MBANs) in a mobile health care system.In this paper, we
investigate the transmission characteristics of the human body as a conductor
of signals by considering different data transmission rates of multi-point to
point network in order to reduce overall power consumption of the
BAN.Furthermore, we utilize IBC and propose a new scheme to combines Slotted
ALOHA, TDMA, and Reservation ALOHA together to increase the throughput and
decrease the delay. By using our new hybrid scheme with the movable boundary
designed for health status monitoring, we are able to increase the efficiency
of data transmission by prioritizing the more critical data from the sensors.

"
105,A Novel Design for Quantum-dot Cellular Automata Cells and Full Adders,"  Quantum dot Cellular Automata (QCA) is a novel and potentially attractive
technology for implementing computing architectures at the nanoscale. The basic
Boolean primitive in QCA is the majority gate. In this paper we present a novel
design for QCA cells and another possible and unconventional scheme for
majority gates. By applying these items, the hardware requirements for a QCA
design can be reduced and circuits can be simpler in level and gate counts. As
an example, a 1-bit QCA adder is constructed by applying our new scheme and is
compared to the other existing implementation. Beside, some Boolean functions
are expressed as examples and it has been shown, how our reduction method by
using new proposed item, decreases gate counts and levels in comparison to the
other previous methods.

106,Coordinated Home Energy Management for Real-Time Power Balancing,"  This paper proposes a coordinated home energy management system (HEMS)
architecture where the distributed residential units cooperate with each other
to achieve real-time power balancing. The economic benefits for the retailer
and incentives for the customers to participate in the proposed coordinated
HEMS program are given. We formulate the coordinated HEMS design problem as a
dynamic programming (DP) and use approximate DP approaches to efficiently
handle the design problem. A distributed implementation algorithm based on the
convex optimization based dual decomposition technique is also presented. Our
focus in the current paper is on the deferrable appliances, such as Plug-in
(Hybrid) Electric Vehicles (PHEV), in view of their higher impact on the grid
stability. Simulation results shows that the proposed coordinated HEMS
architecture can efficiently improve the real-time power balancing.
"
107,"Noise based logic: why noise? A comparative study of the necessity of
  randomness out of orthogonality","  Although noise-based logic shows potential advantages of reduced power
dissipation and the ability of large parallel operations with low hardware and
time complexity the question still persist: is randomness really needed out of
orthogonality? In this Letter, after some general thermodynamical
considerations, we show relevant examples where we compare the computational
complexity of logic systems based on orthogonal noise and sinusoidal signals,
respectively. The conclusion is that in certain special-purpose applications
noise-based logic is exponentially better than its sinusoidal version: its
computational complexity can be exponentially smaller to perform the same task.
"
108,High-dimensional noise-based logical controller,"  We introduce a scheme for controlling physical and other quantities;
utilizing noise-based logic for control-and-optimization with high
dimensionality, similarly how the Hilbert space of quantum informatics can be
utilized for such purpose. As a concrete realization of the noise-based control
scheme, we introduce ""Dictatorial control"" where noise-based logic results in
an exponential speedup of operation.
"
109,Optical Solver of Combinatorial Problems: Nano-Technological Approach,"  We report the first steps in creating an optical computing system. This
system may solve NP-Hard problems by utilizing a setup of exponential sized
masks. This is exponential space complexity but the production of those masks
is done with a polynomial time preprocessing. These masks are later used to
solve the problem in polynomial time. We propose to reduced the size of the
masks to nano-scaled density. Simulations were done to choose a proper design,
and actual implementations show the feasibility of such a system.

110,"A low power high bandwidth four quadrant analog multiplier in 32 nm
  CNFET technology","  Carbon Nanotube Field Effect Transistor (CNFET) is a promising new technology
that overcomes several limitations of traditional silicon integrated circuit
technology. In recent years, the potential of CNFET for analog circuit
applications has been explored. This paper proposes a novel four quadrant
analog multiplier design using CNFETs. The simulation based on 32nm CNFET
technology shows that the proposed multiplier has very low harmonic distortion
(<0.45%), large input range ({\pm}400mV), large bandwidth (~50GHz) and low

111,"Automating Open Fault Correction in Integrated Circuits via Field
  Induced Diffusion Limited Aggregation","  We perform studies on electric field induced diffusion limited aggregation of
conductive particles dispersed in a non conductive medium. The bridges formed
across gaps between electrodes with an electric field in between due to the
aggregation mechanism provides a means to automate the correction of open

for the bridging time and describe the mechanics of bridge formation with the
above application in mind.

112,CDMA Based Interconnect Mechanism for SOPC,"  The Network-on-chip (NoC) designs consisting of large pack of Intellectual
Property (IP) blocks (cores) on the same silicon die is becoming technically
possible nowadays. But, the communication between the IP Cores is the main
issue in recent years. This paper presents the design of a Code Division
Multiple Access (CDMA) based wrapper interconnect as a component of System on
programmable chip (SOPC) builder to communicate between IP cores. In the
proposal, only bus lines that carry address and data signals are CDMA coded.
CDMA technology has better data integrity, channel continuity, channel
isolation, and also mainly it reduces the no.of lines in the bus architecture
for transmitting the data from master to slave.
"
113,Polariton Condensate Transistor Switch,"  A polariton condensate transistor switch is realized through optical
excitation of a microcavity ridge with two beams. The ballistically ejected
polaritons from a condensate formed at the source are gated using the 20 times
weaker second beam to switch on and off the flux of polaritons. In the absence
of the gate beam the small built-in detuning creates potential landscape in
which ejected polaritons are channelled toward the end of the ridge where they
condense. The low loss photon-like propagation combined with strong
nonlinearities associated with their excitonic component makes polariton based
transistors particularly attractive for the implementation of all-optical
integrated circuits.

"
115,"A meet-in-the-middle algorithm for fast synthesis of depth-optimal
  quantum circuits","  We present an algorithm for computing depth-optimal decompositions of logical
operations, leveraging a meet-in-the-middle technique to provide a significant
speed-up over simple brute force algorithms. As an illustration of our method
we implemented this algorithm and found factorizations of the commonly used
quantum logical operations into elementary gates in the Clifford+T set. In
particular, we report a decomposition of the Toffoli gate over the set of
Clifford and T gates. Our decomposition achieves a total T-depth of 3, thereby
providing a 40% reduction over the previously best known decomposition for the
Toffoli gate. Due to the size of the search space the algorithm is only
practical for small parameters, such as the number of qubits, and the number of
gates in an optimal implementation.
"
116,Information theoretic security by the laws of classical physics,"  It has been shown recently that the use of two pairs of resistors with
enhanced Johnson-noise and a Kirchhoff-loop-i.e., a Kirchhoff-Law-Johnson-Noise
(KLJN) protocol-for secure key distribution leads to information theoretic
security levels superior to those of a quantum key distribution, including a
natural immunity against a man-in-the-middle attack. This issue is becoming
particularly timely because of the recent full cracks of practical quantum
communicators, as shown in numerous peer-reviewed publications. This
presentation first briefly surveys the KLJN system and then discusses related,
essential questions such as: what are perfect and imperfect security
characteristics of key distribution, and how can these two types of securities
be unconditional (or information theoretical)? Finally the presentation
contains a live demonstration.
"
117,Proposal For Neuromorphic Hardware Using Spin Devices,"  We present a design-scheme for ultra-low power neuromorphic hardware using
emerging spin-devices. We propose device models for 'neuron', based on lateral
spin valves and domain wall magnets that can operate at ultra-low terminal
voltage of ~20 mV, resulting in small computation energy. Magnetic tunnel
junctions are employed for interfacing the spin-neurons with charge-based
devices like CMOS, for large-scale networks. Device-circuit
co-simulation-framework is used for simulating such hybrid designs, in order to
evaluate system-level performance. We present the design of different classes
of neuromorphic architectures using the proposed scheme that can be suitable
for different applications like, analog-data-sensing, data-conversion,
cognitive-computing, associative memory, programmable-logic and analog and
digital signal processing. We show that the spin-based neuromorphic designs can
achieve 15X-300X lower computation energy for these applications; as compared
to state of art CMOS designs.

118,"Fast and efficient exact synthesis of single qubit unitaries generated
  by Clifford and T gates","  In this paper, we show the equivalence of the set of unitaries computable by
the circuits over the Clifford and T library and the set of unitaries over the
ring $\mathbb{Z}[\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}},i]$, in the single-qubit case. We report an
efficient synthesis algorithm, with an exact optimality guarantee on the number
of Hadamard and T gates used. We conjecture that the equivalence of the sets of
unitaries implementable by circuits over the Clifford and T library and
unitaries over the ring $\mathbb{Z}[\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}},i]$ holds in the
$n$-qubit case.
"
119,Path Selection for Quantum Repeater Networks,"  Quantum networks will support long-distance quantum key distribution (QKD)
and distributed quantum computation, and are an active area of both
experimental and theoretical research. Here, we present an analysis of
topologically complex networks of quantum repeaters composed of heterogeneous
links. Quantum networks have fundamental behavioral differences from classical
networks; the delicacy of quantum states makes a practical path selection
algorithm imperative, but classical notions of resource utilization are not
directly applicable, rendering known path selection mechanisms inadequate. To
adapt Dijkstra's algorithm for quantum repeater networks that generate
entangled Bell pairs, we quantify the key differences and define a link cost
metric, seconds per Bell pair of a particular fidelity, where a single Bell
pair is the resource consumed to perform one quantum teleportation. Simulations
that include both the physical interactions and the extensive classical
messaging confirm that Dijkstra's algorithm works well in a quantum context.
Simulating about three hundred heterogeneous paths, comparing our path cost and
the total work along the path gives a coefficient of determination of 0.88 or
better.

120,Memristor-based mono-stable oscillator,"  In this letter, a reactance-less mono-stable oscillator is introduced for the
first time using memristors. By replacing bulky inductors and capacitors with
memristors, the novel mono-stable oscillator can be an area-efficient solution
for on-chip fully integrated systems. The proposed circuit is described,
mathematically analysed and verified by circuit simulations.
"
121,"Modular Arithmetic Expressions and Primality Testing via DNA
  Self-Assembly","  Self-assembly is a fundamental process by which supramolecular species form
spontaneously from their components. This process is ubiquitous throughout the
life chemistry and is central to biological information processing. Algorithms
for solving many mathematical and computational problems via tile self assembly
have been proposed by many researchers in the last decade. In particular tile
set for doing basic arithmetic of two inputs have been given. In this work we
give tile set for doing basic arithmetic (addition, subtraction,
multiplication) of n inputs and subsequently computing its modulo. We also
present a tile set for primality testing. Finally we present a software
'xtilemod' for doing modular arithmetic. This simplifies the task of creating
the input files to xgrow simulator for doing basic (addition, subtraction,
multiplication and division) as well as modular arithmetic of n inputs. Similar
software for creating tile set for primality testing is also given.

122,All-optical Reservoir Computing,"  Reservoir Computing is a novel computing paradigm which uses a nonlinear
recurrent dynamical system to carry out information processing. Recent
electronic and optoelectronic Reservoir Computers based on an architecture with
a single nonlinear node and a delay loop have shown performance on standardized
tasks comparable to state-of-the-art digital implementations. Here we report an
all-optical implementation of a Reservoir Computer, made of off-the-shelf
components for optical telecommunications. It uses the saturation of a
semiconductor optical amplifier as nonlinearity. The present work shows that,
within the Reservoir Computing paradigm, all-optical computing with
state-of-the-art performance is possible.
"
123,Automated Training and Maintenance through Kinect,"  In this paper, we have worked on reducing burden on mechanic involving
complex automobile maintenance activities that are performed in centralised
workshops. We have presented a system prototype that combines Augmented Reality
with Kinect. With the use of Kinect, very high quality sensors are available at
considerably low costs, thus reducing overall expenditure for system design.
The system can be operated either in Speech mode or in Gesture mode. The system
can be controlled by various audio commands if user opts for Speech mode. The
same controlling can also be done by using a set of Gestures in Gesture mode.
  Gesture recognition is the task performed by Kinect system. This system,
bundled with RGB and Depth camera, processes the skeletal data by keeping track
of 20 different body joints. Recognizing Gestures is done by verifying user
movements and checking them against predefined condition. Augmented Reality
module captures real-time image data streams from high resolution camera. This
module then generates 3D model that is superimposed on real time data.
"
124,"A 2D Nearest-Neighbor Quantum Architecture for Factoring in
  Polylogarithmic Depth","  We contribute a 2D nearest-neighbor quantum architecture for Shor's algorithm
to factor an $n$-bit number in $O(\log^2(n))$ depth. Our implementation uses
parallel phase estimation, constant-depth fanout and teleportation, and
constant-depth carry-save modular addition. We derive upper bounds on the
circuit resources of our architecture under a new 2D nearest-neighbor model
which allows a classical controller and parallel, communicating modules. We
also contribute a novel constant-depth circuit for unbounded quantum unfanout
in our new model. Finally, we provide a comparison to all previous
nearest-neighbor factoring implementations. Our circuit results in an
exponential improvement in nearest-neighbor circuit depth at the cost of a
polynomial increase in circuit size and width.
"
125,Device Considerations for Nanophotonic CMOS Global Interconnects,"  We introduce an analytical framework to understand the path for scaling
nanophotonic interconnects to meet the energy and footprint requirements of
CMOS global interconnects. We derive the device requirements for sub 100
fJ/cm/bit interconnects including tuning power, serialization-deserialization
energy, optical insertion losses, extinction ratio and bit error rates. Using
CMOS with integrated nanophotonics as an example platform, we derive the
energy/bit, linear and areal bandwidth density of optical interconnects. We
also derive the targets for device performance which indicate the need for
continued improvements in insertion losses (<8dB), laser efficiency,
operational speeds (>40 Gb/s), tuning power (<100 {\mu}W/nm),
serialization-deserialization (< 10 fJ/bit/Operation) and necessity for
spectrally selective devices with wavelength multiplexing (> 6 channels).

126,"Proceedings 7th International Workshop on Developments of Computational
  Methods","  This volume contains the proceedings of the 7th International Workshop on
Developments in Computational Models (DCM 2011) which was held on Sunday July
3, 2011, in Zurich, Switzerland, as a satelite workshop of ICALP 2011.
  Recently several new models of computation have emerged, for instance for
bio-computing and quantum-computing, and in addition traditional models of
computation have been adapted to accommodate new demands or capabilities of
computer systems. The aim of DCM is to bring together researchers who are
currently developing new computational models or new features for traditional
computational models, in order to foster their interaction, to provide a forum
for presenting new ideas and work in progress, and to enable newcomers to learn
about current activities in this area.
"
127,"Filamentary Extension of the Mem-Con theory of Memristance and its
  Application to Titanium Dioxide Sol-Gel Memristors","  Titanium dioxide sol-gel memristors have two different modes of operation,
believed to be dependent on whether there is bulk memristance, i.e. memristance
throughout the whole volume or filamentary memristance, i.e. memristance caused
by the connection of conducting filaments. The mem-con theory of memristance is
based on the drift of oxygen vacancies rather than that of conducting electrons
and has been previously used to describe bulk memristance in several devices.
Here, the mem-con theory is extended to model memristance caused by small
filaments of low resistance titanium dioxide and it compares favorably to
experimental results for filamentary memristance in sol-gel devices.
"
128,"The Effect of Electrode Size on Memristor Properties: An Experimental
  and Theoretical Study","  The width of the electrodes is not included in the current phenomenological
models of memristance, but is included in the memory-conservation (mem-con)
theory of memristance. An experimental study of the effect of changing the top
electrode width was performed on titanium dioxide sol-gel memristors. It was
demonstrated that both the on resistance, Ron, and the off resistance, Roff,
decreased with increasing electrode size. The memory function part of the
mem-con model could fit the relationship between Ron and electrode size.
Similarly, the conservation function fits the change in Roff. The
experimentally measured hysteresis did not fit the phenomenological model's
predictions. Instead the size of the hysteresis increased with increasing
electrode size, and correlated well to decreasing Ron.
"
129,"Operator formalism for optical neural network based on the parametrical
  four-wave mixing process","  In this paper we develop a formalism allowing us to describe operating of a
network based on the parametrical four-wave mixing process that is well-known
in nonlinear optics. The recognition power of a network using parametric
neurons operating with q different frequencies is considered. It is shown that
the storage capacity of such a network is higher compared with the Potts-glass
models.
"
130,"Sinusoidal analysis of memristor bridge circuit-rectifier for low
  frequencies","  Reasoned by its dynamical behavior, the memristor enables a lot of new
applications in analog circuit design. Since some realizations are shown (e.g.
2007 by Hewlett Packard), the development of applications with memristors
becomes more and more interesting. Whereas most of the research was done in the
direction of memristor applications in neural networks and storage devices,
less publications deal with practical applications of analog memristive
circuits. But this topic is also promising further applications. Therefore,
this article proposes a frequency dependent rectifier memristor bridge for
different purposes (e.g. using as a programmable synaptic membrane voltage
generator for Spike-Time-Dependent-Plasticity) and describes the circuit
theory. In this context it is shown that the Picard Iteration is one
possibility to solve the system of nonlinear state equations of memristor
circuits analytically. An intuitive picture of how a memristor works in a
network in general is given as well. In this context some research on the
dynamical behavior of a HP memristor should be done.
"
131,Depth-Optimized Reversible Circuit Synthesis,"  In this paper, simultaneous reduction of circuit depth and synthesis cost of
reversible circuits in quantum technologies with limited interaction is
addressed. We developed a cycle-based synthesis algorithm which uses negative
controls and limited distance between gate lines. To improve circuit depth, a
new parallel structure is introduced in which before synthesis a set of
disjoint cycles are extracted from the input specification and distributed into
some subsets. The cycles of each subset are synthesized independently on
different sets of ancillae. Accordingly, each disjoint set can be synthesized
by different synthesis methods. Our analysis shows that the best worst-case
synthesis cost of reversible circuits in the linear nearest neighbor
architecture is improved by the proposed approach. Our experimental results
reveal the effectiveness of the proposed approach to reduce cost and circuit
depth for several benchmarks.
"
132,Analog readout for optical reservoir computers,"  Reservoir computing is a new, powerful and flexible machine learning
technique that is easily implemented in hardware. Recently, by using a
time-multiplexed architecture, hardware reservoir computers have reached
performance comparable to digital implementations. Operating speeds allowing
for real time information operation have been reached using optoelectronic
systems. At present the main performance bottleneck is the readout layer which
uses slow, digital postprocessing. We have designed an analog readout suitable
for time-multiplexed optoelectronic reservoir computers, capable of working in
real time. The readout has been built and tested experimentally on a standard
benchmark task. Its performance is better than non-reservoir methods, with
ample room for further improvement. The present work thereby overcomes one of
the major limitations for the future development of hardware reservoir
computers.
"
133,"Analysis of Cognitive Radio Scenes Based on Non-cooperative Game
  Theoretical Modelling","  A noncooperative game theoretical approach for analysing opportunistic
spectrum access (OSA) in cognitive radio (CR) environments is proposed. New
concepts from game theory are applied to spectrum access analysis in order to
extract rules of behaviour for an emerging environment. In order to assess OSA
scenarios of CRs, two oligopoly game models are reformulated in terms of
resource access: Cournot and Stackelberg games. Five CR scenes are analysed:
simultaneous access of unlicensed users (commons regime) with symmetric and
asymmetric costs, with and without bandwidth constraints and sequential access
(licensed against unlicensed). Several equilibrium concepts are studied as game
solutions: Nash, Pareto and the joint NashPareto equilibrium. The latter
captures a game situation where players are non-homogeneous users, exhibiting
different types of rationality, Nash and Pareto. This enables a more realistic
modelling of interactions on a CR scene. An evolutionary game equilibrium
detection method is used. The Nash equilibrium indicates the maximum number of
channels a CR may access without decreasing its payoff. The Pareto equilibrium
describes a larger range of payoffs, capturing unbalanced as well as equitable
solutions. The analysis of the Stackelberg modelling shows that payoffs are
maximised for all users if the incumbents are Nash oriented and the new
entrants are Pareto driven.
"
134,"Quantum binary field inversion: improved circuit depth via choice of
  basis representation","  Finite fields of the form GF(2^m) play an important role in coding theory and
cryptography. We show that the choice of how to represent the elements of these
fields can have a significant impact on the resource requirements for quantum
arithmetic. In particular, we show how the use of Gaussian normal basis
representations and of `ghost-bit basis' representations can be used to
implement inverters with a quantum circuit of depth O(m log(m)). To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first construction with subquadratic depth reported
in the literature. Our quantum circuit for the computation of multiplicative
inverses is based on the Itoh-Tsujii algorithm which exploits that in normal
basis representation squaring corresponds to a permutation of the coefficients.
We give resource estimates for the resulting quantum circuit for inversion over
binary fields GF(2^m) based on an elementary gate set that is useful for
fault-tolerant implementation.
"
135,"Efficient quantum circuits for binary elliptic curve arithmetic:
  reducing T-gate complexity","  Elliptic curves over finite fields GF(2^n) play a prominent role in modern
cryptography. Published quantum algorithms dealing with such curves build on a
short Weierstrass form in combination with affine or projective coordinates. In
this paper we show that changing the curve representation allows a substantial
reduction in the number of T-gates needed to implement the curve arithmetic. As
a tool, we present a quantum circuit for computing multiplicative inverses in
GF(2^n) in depth O(n log n) using a polynomial basis representation, which may
be of independent interest.
"
136,A Framework for Heterotic Computing,"  Computational devices combining two or more different parts, one controlling
the operation of the other, for example, derive their power from the
interaction, in addition to the capabilities of the parts. Non-classical
computation has tended to consider only single computational models: neural,
analog, quantum, chemical, biological, neglecting to account for the
contribution from the experimental controls. In this position paper, we propose
a framework suitable for analysing combined computational models, from abstract
theory to practical programming tools. Focusing on the simplest example of one
system controlled by another through a sequence of operations in which only one
system is active at a time, the output from one system becomes the input to the
other for the next step, and vice versa. We outline the categorical machinery
required for handling diverse computational systems in such combinations, with
their interactions explicitly accounted for. Drawing on prior work in
refinement and retrenchment, we suggest an appropriate framework for developing
programming tools from the categorical framework. We place this work in the
context of two contrasting concepts of ""efficiency"": theoretical comparisons to
determine the relative computational power do not always reflect the practical
comparison of real resources for a finite-sized computational task, especially
when the inputs include (approximations of) real numbers. Finally we outline
the limitations of our simple model, and identify some of the extensions that
will be required to treat more complex interacting computational systems.
"
137,A Survey of Delay Tolerant Networks Routing Protocols,"  Advances in Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) have revolutionized the
digital age to a point where animate and inanimate objects can be used as a
communication channel. In addition, the ubiquity of mobile phones with
increasing capabilities and ample resources means people are now effectively
mobile sensors that can be used to sense the environment as well as data
carriers. These objects, along with their devices, form a new kind of networks
that are characterized by frequent disconnections, resource constraints and
unpredictable or stochastic mobility patterns. A key underpinning in these
networks is routing or data dissemination protocols that are designed
specifically to handle the aforementioned characteristics. Therefore, there is
a need to review state-of-the-art routing protocols, categorize them, and
compare and contrast their approaches in terms of delivery rate, resource
consumption and end-to-end delay. To this end, this paper reviews 63 unicast,
multicast and coding-based routing protocols that are designed specifically to
run in delay tolerant or challenged networks. We provide an extensive
qualitative comparison of all protocols, highlight their experimental setup and
outline their deficiencies in terms of design and research methodology. Apart
from that, we review research that aims to exploit studies on social networks
and epidemiology in order to improve routing protocol performance. Lastly, we
provide a list of future research directions.
"
138,Quantum circuits of T-depth one,"  We give a Clifford+T representation of the Toffoli gate of T-depth 1, using
four ancillas. More generally, we describe a class of circuits whose T-depth
can be reduced to 1 by using sufficiently many ancillas. We show that the cost
of adding an additional control to any controlled gate is at most 8 additional
T-gates, and T-depth 2. We also show that the circuit THT does not possess a
T-depth 1 representation with an arbitrary number of ancillas initialized to 0.
"
139,All Spin Nano-magnetic State Elements,"  We propose an all spin state element to enable all spin state machines using
spin currents and nanomagnets. We demonstrate via numerical simulations the
operation of a state element a critical building block for synchronous,
sequential logic computation. The numerical models encompass
Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) nanomagnet dynamics with stochastic models and
vector spin-transport in metallic magnetic and non-magnetic channels. Combined
with all spin combinatorial logic, the state elements can enable synchronous
and asynchronous computing elements.
"
140,"A State Distillation Protocol to Implement Arbitrary Single-qubit
  Rotations","  An important task required to build a scalable, fault-tolerant quantum
computer is to efficiently represent an arbitrary single-qubit rotation by
fault-tolerant quantum operations. Traditionally, the method for decomposing a
single-qubit unitary into a discrete set of gates is Solovay-Kitaev
decomposition, which in practice produces a sequence of depth
O(\log^c(1/\epsilon)), where c~3.97 is the state-of-the-art. The proven lower
bound is c=1, however an efficient algorithm that saturates this bound is
unknown. In this paper, we present an alternative to Solovay-Kitaev
decomposition employing state distillation techniques which reduces c to
between 1.12 and 2.27, depending on the setting. For a given single-qubit
rotation, our protocol significantly lowers the length of the approximating
sequence and the number of required resource states (ancillary qubits). In
addition, our protocol is robust to noise in the resource states.
"
141,Practical intractability: a critique of the hypercomputation movement,"  For over a decade, the hypercomputation movement has produced computational
models that in theory solve the algorithmically unsolvable, but they are not
physically realizable according to currently accepted physical theories. While
opponents to the hypercomputation movement provide arguments against the
physical realizability of specific models in order to demonstrate this, these
arguments lack the generality to be a satisfactory justification against the
construction of \emph{any} information-processing machine that computes beyond
the universal Turing machine. To this end, I present a more mathematically
concrete challenge to hypercomputability, and will show that one is immediately
led into physical impossibilities, thereby demonstrating the infeasibility of
hypercomputers more generally. This gives impetus to propose and justify a more
plausible starting point for an extension to the classical paradigm that is
physically possible, at least in principle. Instead of attempting to rely on
infinities such as idealized limits of infinite time or numerical precision, or
some other physically unattainable source, one should focus on extending the
classical paradigm to better encapsulate modern computational problems that are
not well-expressed/modeled by the closed-system paradigm of the Turing machine.
I present the first steps toward this goal by considering contemporary
computational problems dealing with intractability and issues surrounding
cyber-physical systems, and argue that a reasonable extension to the classical
paradigm should focus on these issues in order to be practically viable.
"
142,Whole Genome Sequencing: Innovation Dream or Privacy Nightmare?,"  Over the past several years, DNA sequencing has emerged as one of the driving
forces in life-sciences, paving the way for affordable and accurate whole
genome sequencing. As genomes represent the entirety of an organism's
hereditary information, the availability of complete human genomes prompts a
wide range of revolutionary applications. The hope for improving modern
healthcare and better understanding the human genome propels many interesting
and challenging research frontiers. Unfortunately, however, the proliferation
of human genomes amplifies worrisome privacy concerns, since a genome
represents a treasure trove of highly personal and sensitive information. In
this article, we provide an overview of positive results and biomedical
advances in the field, and discuss privacy issues associated with human genomic
information. Finally, we survey available privacy-enhancing technologies and
list a number of open research challenges.
"
143,Design & Simulation of 128x Interpolator Filter,"  This paper presents the design consideration and simulation of interpolator
of OSR 128. The proposed structure uses the half band filers & Comb/Sinc
filter. Experimental result shows that proposed interpolator achieves the
design specification, and also has good noise rejection capabilities. The
interpolator accepts the input at 44.1 kHz for applications like CD & DVD
audio. The interpolation filter can be applied to the delta sigma DAC. The
related work is done with the MATLAB & XILINX ISE simulators. The maximum
operating frequency is achieved as 34.584 MHz.
"
144,"Eigenvalue Based Sensing and SNR Estimation for Cognitive Radio in
  Presence of Noise Correlation","  Herein, we present a detailed analysis of an eigenvalue based sensing
technique in the presence of correlated noise in the context of a Cognitive
Radio (CR). We use a Standard Condition Number (SCN) based decision statistic
based on asymptotic Random Matrix Theory (RMT) for decision process. Firstly,
the effect of noise correlation on eigenvalue based Spectrum Sensing (SS) is
studied analytically under both the noise only and the signal plus noise
hypotheses. Secondly, new bounds for the SCN are proposed for achieving
improved sensing in correlated noise scenarios. Thirdly, the performance of
Fractional Sampling (FS) based SS is studied and a method for determining the
operating point for the FS rate in terms of sensing performance and complexity
is suggested. Finally, an SNR estimation technique based on the maximum
eigenvalue of the received signal's covariance matrix is proposed. It is shown
that proposed SCN-based threshold improves sensing performance in the presence
of correlated noise and SNRs upto 0 dB can be reliably estimated without the
knowledge of noise variance.
"
145,Time After Time: Notes on Delays In Spiking Neural P Systems,"  Spiking Neural P systems, SNP systems for short, are biologically inspired
computing devices based on how neurons perform computations. SNP systems use
only one type of symbol, the spike, in the computations. Information is encoded
in the time differences of spikes or the multiplicity of spikes produced at
certain times. SNP systems with delays (associated with rules) and those
without delays are two of several Turing complete SNP system variants in
literature. In this work we investigate how restricted forms of SNP systems
with delays can be simulated by SNP systems without delays. We show the
simulations for the following spike routing constructs: sequential, iteration,
join, and split.
"
146,Efficient Inner-product Algorithm for Stabilizer States,"  Large-scale quantum computation is likely to require massive quantum error
correction (QEC). QEC codes and circuits are described via the stabilizer
formalism, which represents stabilizer states by keeping track of the operators
that preserve them. Such states are obtained by stabilizer circuits (consisting
of CNOT, Hadamard and Phase only) and can be represented compactly on
conventional computers using Omega(n^2) bits, where n is the number of qubits.
Although techniques for the efficient simulation of stabilizer circuits have
been studied extensively, techniques for efficient manipulation of stabilizer
states are not currently available. To this end, we design new algorithms for:
(i) obtaining canonical generators for stabilizer states, (ii) obtaining
canonical stabilizer circuits, and (iii) computing the inner product between
stabilizer states. Our inner-product algorithm takes O(n^3) time in general,
but observes quadratic behavior for many practical instances relevant to QECC
(e.g., GHZ states). We prove that each n-qubit stabilizer state has exactly
4(2^n - 1) nearest-neighbor stabilizer states, and verify this claim
experimentally using our algorithms. We design techniques for representing
arbitrary quantum states using stabilizer frames and generalize our algorithms
to compute the inner product between two such frames.
"
147,Emergent Spiking in Non-Ideal Memristor Networks,"  Memristors have uses as artificial synapses and perform well in this role in
simulations with artificial spiking neurons. Our experiments show that
memristor networks natively spike and can exhibit emergent oscillations and
bursting spikes. Networks of near-ideal memristors exhibit behaviour similar to
a single memristor and combine in circuits like resistors do. Spiking is more
likely when filamentary memristors are used or the circuits have a higher
degree of compositional complexity (i.e. a larger number of anti-series or
anti-parallel interactions). 3-memristor circuits with the same memristor
polarity (low compositional complexity) are stabilised and do not show spiking
behaviour. 3-memristor circuits with anti-series and/or anti-parallel
compositions show richer and more complex dynamics than 2-memristor spiking
circuits. We show that the complexity of these dynamics can be quantified by
calculating (using partial auto-correlation functions) the minimum order
auto-regression function that could fit it. We propose that these oscillations
and spikes may be similar phenomena to brainwaves and neural spike trains and
suggest that these behaviours can be used to perform neuromorphic computation.
"
148,"Route 20, autobahn 7 and Physarum polycephalum: Approximating longest
  roads in USA and Germany with slime mould on 3D terrains","  Acellular slime mould Physarum polycephalum is a monstrously large single
cell visible by an unaided eye. It shows sophisticated behavioural traits in
foraging for nutrients and developing an optimal transport network of
protoplasmic tubes spanning sources of nutrients. The slime mould sufficiently
approximates man-made transport networks on a flat substrate. Does slime mould
imitate man-made transport networks on three-dimensional terrain as well as it
does on a flat substrate? We simplified the problem to approximation of a
single transport route. In laboratory experiments with 3D Nylon terrains of USA
and Germany we imitated development of route 20, the longest road in USA, and
autobahn 7, the longest national motorway in Europe. We found that slime mould
builds longer transport routes on 3D terrains, comparing to flat agar plates
yet sufficiently approximates man-made transport routes studied. We discuss how
nutrients placed in destination sites affect performance of slime mould, how
the mould navigates around elevations, and offer an automaton model of slime
mould which might explain variability of the protoplasmic routes constructed.
We also display results of scoping experiments with slime mould on 3D terrains
of Russia and United Kingdom.
"
149,Brain Computer Interface Technologies in the Coming Decades,"  As the proliferation of technology dramatically infiltrates all aspects of
modern life, in many ways the world is becoming so dynamic and complex that
technological capabilities are overwhelming human capabilities to optimally
interact with and leverage those technologies. Fortunately, these technological
advancements have also driven an explosion of neuroscience research over the
past several decades, presenting engineers with a remarkable opportunity to
design and develop flexible and adaptive brain-based neurotechnologies that
integrate with and capitalize on human capabilities and limitations to improve
human-system interactions. Major forerunners of this conception are
brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), which to this point have been largely focused
on improving the quality of life for particular clinical populations and
include, for example, applications for advanced communications with paralyzed
or locked in patients as well as the direct control of prostheses and
wheelchairs. Near-term applications are envisioned that are primarily task
oriented and are targeted to avoid the most difficult obstacles to development.
In the farther term, a holistic approach to BCIs will enable a broad range of
task-oriented and opportunistic applications by leveraging pervasive
technologies and advanced analytical approaches to sense and merge critical
brain, behavioral, task, and environmental information. Communications and
other applications that are envisioned to be broadly impacted by BCIs are
highlighted; however, these represent just a small sample of the potential of
these technologies.
"
150,An Exploration on Brain Computer Interface and Its Recent Trends,"  Detailed exploration on Brain Computer Interface (BCI) and its recent trends
has been done in this paper. Work is being done to identify objects, images,
videos and their color compositions. Efforts are on the way in understanding
speech, words, emotions, feelings and moods. When humans watch the surrounding
environment, visual data is processed by the brain, and it is possible to
reconstruct the same on the screen with some appreciable accuracy by analyzing
the physiological data. This data is acquired by using one of the non-invasive
techniques like electroencephalography (EEG) in BCI. The acquired signal is to
be translated to produce the image on to the screen. This paper also lays
suitable directions for future work.
"
151,"Active Tile Self-assembly, Self-similar Structures and Recursion","  We present an active tile assembly model which extends Winfree's abstract
tile assembly model to tiles that are capable of transmitting and receiving
binding site activation signals. In addition, we introduce a mathematical
framework to address self-similarity and recursion within the model. The model
is applied to show a recursive assembly of an archetypal self-similar aperiodic
tiling known as the L-shape tiling.

152,"Proceedings 6th Workshop on Membrane Computing and Biologically Inspired
  Process Calculi","  This volume contains the papers presented at the 6th Membrane Computing and
Biologically Inspired Process Calculi (MeCBIC 2012), a satellite workshop of
the 23rd International Conference on Concurrency Theory (CONCUR) held on 8th
September 2012 in Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.
"
153,Membrane Systems and Petri Net Synthesis,"  Automated synthesis from behavioural specifications is an attractive and
powerful way of constructing concurrent systems. Here we focus on the problem
of synthesising a membrane system from a behavioural specification given in the
form of a transition system which specifies the desired state space of the
system to be constructed. We demonstrate how a Petri net solution to this
problem, based on the notion of region of a transition system, yields a method
of automated synthesis of membrane systems from state spaces.
"
154,"Memcomputing: a computing paradigm to store and process information on
  the same physical platform","  In present day technology, storing and processing of information occur on
physically distinct regions of space. Not only does this result in space
limitations; it also translates into unwanted delays in retrieving and
processing of relevant information. There is, however, a class of two-terminal
passive circuit elements with memory, memristive, memcapacitive and
meminductive systems -- collectively called memelements -- that perform both
information processing and storing of the initial, intermediate and final
computational data on the same physical platform. Importantly, the states of
these memelements adjust to input signals and provide analog capabilities
unavailable in standard circuit elements, resulting in adaptive circuitry, and
providing analog massively-parallel computation. All these features are
tantalizingly similar to those encountered in the biological realm, thus
offering new opportunities for biologically-inspired computation. Of particular
importance is the fact that these memelements emerge naturally in nanoscale
systems, and are therefore a consequence and a natural by-product of the
continued miniaturization of electronic devices. We will discuss the various
possibilities offered by memcomputing, discuss the criteria that need to be
satisfied to realize this paradigm, and provide an example showing the solution
of the shortest-path problem and demonstrate the healing property of the
solution path.
"
155,"How to make dull cellular automata complex by adding memory: Rule 126
  case study","  Using Rule 126 elementary cellular automaton (ECA) we demonstrate that a
chaotic discrete system --- when enriched with memory -- hence exhibits complex
dynamics where such space exploits on an ample universe of periodic patterns
induced from original information of the ahistorical system. First we analyse
classic ECA Rule 126 to identify basic characteristics with mean field theory,
basins, and de Bruijn diagrams. In order to derive this complex dynamics, we
use a kind of memory on Rule 126; from here interactions between gliders are
studied for detecting stationary patterns, glider guns and simulating specific
simple computable functions produced by glider collisions.
"
156,Exact synthesis of multiqubit Clifford+T circuits,"  We prove that a unitary matrix has an exact representation over the
Clifford+T gate set with local ancillas if and only if its entries are in the
ring Z[1/sqrt(2),i]. Moreover, we show that one ancilla always suffices. These
facts were conjectured by Kliuchnikov, Maslov, and Mosca. We obtain an
algorithm for synthesizing a exact Clifford+T circuit from any such n-qubit
operator. We also characterize the Clifford+T operators that can be represented
without ancillas.
"
157,Towards Physarum Engines,"  The slime mould Physarum polycephalum is a suitable candidate organism for
soft-matter robotics because it exhibits controllable transport, movement and
guidance behaviour. Physarum may be considered as a smart computing and
actuating material since both its motor and control systems are distributed
within its undifferentiated tissue and can survive trauma such as excision,
fission and fusion of plasmodia. Thus it may be suitable for exploring the
generation and distribution of micro-actuation in individual units or planar
arrays. We experimentally show how the plasmodium of Physarum is shaped to
execute controllable oscillatory transport behaviour applicable in small hybrid
engines. We measure the lifting force of the plasmodium and demonstrate how
protoplasmic transport can be influenced by externally applied illumination
stimuli. We provide an exemplar vehicle mechanism by coupling the oscillations
of the plasmodium to drive the wheels of a Braitenberg vehicle and use light
stimuli to effect a steering mechanism. Using a particle model of Physarum we
show how emergent travelling wave patterns produced by competing oscillatory
domains may be used to to generate spatially represented actuation patterns. We
demonstrate different patterns of controllable motion, including linear,
reciprocal, rotational and helical, and demonstrate in simulation how dynamic
oscillatory patterns may be translated into motive forces for simple transport
of substances within a patterned environment.

158,"Asymptotically optimal approximation of single qubit unitaries by
  Clifford and T circuits using a constant number of ancillary qubits","  We present an algorithm for building a circuit that approximates single qubit
unitaries with precision {\epsilon} using O(log(1/{\epsilon})) Clifford and T
gates and employing up to two ancillary qubits. The algorithm for computing our
approximating circuit requires an average of O(log^2(1/{\epsilon})log
log(1/{\epsilon})) operations. We prove that the number of gates in our circuit
saturates the lower bound on the number of gates required in the scenario when
a constant number of ancillae are supplied, and as such, our circuits are
asymptotically optimal. This results in significant improvement over the
current state of the art for finding an approximation of a unitary, including
the Solovay-Kitaev algorithm that requires O(log^{3+{\delta}}(1/{\epsilon}))
gates and does not use ancillae and the phase kickback approach that requires
O(log^2(1/{\epsilon})log log(1/{\epsilon})) gates, but uses
O(log^2(1/{\epsilon})) ancillae.

159,"Efficient Majority-Logic Decoding of Short-Length Reed--Muller Codes at
  Information Positions","  Short-length Reed--Muller codes under majority-logic decoding are of
particular importance for efficient hardware implementations in real-time and
embedded systems. This paper significantly improves Chen's two-step
majority-logic decoding method for binary Reed--Muller codes $\text{RM}(r,m)$,
$r \leq m/2$, if --- systematic encoding assumed --- only errors at information
positions are to be corrected. Some general results on the minimal number of
majority gates are presented that are particularly good for short codes.
Specifically, with its importance in applications as a 3-error-correcting,
self-dual code, the smallest non-trivial example, $\text{RM}(2,5)$ of dimension
16 and length 32, is investigated in detail. Further, the decoding complexity
of our procedure is compared with that of Chen's decoding algorithm for various
Reed--Muller codes up to length $2^{10}$.

160,"Toward Turing's A-type Unorganised Machines in an Unconventional
  Substrate: a Dynamic Representation in Compartmentalised Excitable Chemical
  Media","  Turing presented a general representation scheme by which to achieve
artificial intelligence - unorganised machines. Significantly, these were a
form of discrete dynamical system and yet such representations remain
relatively unexplored. Further, at the same time as also suggesting that
natural evolution may provide inspiration for search mechanisms to design
machines, he noted that mechanisms inspired by the social aspects of learning
may prove useful. This paper presents initial results from consideration of
using Turing's dynamical representation within an unconventional substrate -
networks of Belousov-Zhabotinsky vesicles - designed by an imitation-based,
i.e., cultural, approach. Turing's representation scheme is also extended to
include a fuller set of Boolean functions at the nodes of the recurrent
networks.
"
161,"Initiation of waves in BZ encapsulated vesicles using light - towards
  design of computing architectures","  A gas free analogue of the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction catalysed by ferroin
and encapsulated in phospholipid stabilised vesicles is reported. A reaction
mixture which exhibits spontaneous oscillation and excitation transfer between
vesicles was formulated. By adjusting the reagent concentrations a quiescent
state with fewer spontaneous oscillations was achieved. Using relatively low
power laser sources of specific wavelengths (green 532nm and blue 405nm) it was
shown that waves could be reproducibly initiated within the BZ vesicles.
Furthermore, despite the reduced excitability of the system overall the
initiated waves exhibited vesicle to vesicle transfer. It was possible to
manipulate single vesicles and design simple circuits based on a 2D validation
of collision based circuits. Therefore, we conclude that this BZ system
exhibits promise for computing applications based on 3D networks of vesicles.

162,"Analysis of patent activity in the field of quantum information
  processing","  This paper provides an analysis of patent activity in the field of quantum
information processing. Data from the PatentScope database from the years
1993-2011 was used. In order to predict the future trends in the number of
filed patents time series models were used.
"
163,On The Delays In Spiking Neural P Systems,"  In this work we extend and improve the results done in a previous work on
simulating Spiking Neural P systems (SNP systems in short) with delays using
SNP systems without delays. We simulate the former with the latter over
sequential, iteration, join, and split routing. Our results provide
constructions so that both systems halt at exactly the same time, start with
only one spike, and produce the same number of spikes to the environment after
halting.
"
164,"Coevolving Cellular Automata with Memory for Chemical Computing: Boolean
  Logic Gates in the B-Z Reaction","  We propose that the behaviour of non-linear media can be controlled
automatically through coevolutionary systems. By extension, forms of
unconventional computing, i.e., massively parallel non-linear computers, can be
realised by such an approach. In this study a light-sensitive sub-excitable
Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction is controlled using various heterogeneous
cellular automata. A checkerboard image comprising of varying light intensity
cells is projected onto the surface of a catalyst-loaded gel resulting in rich
spatio-temporal chemical wave behaviour. The coevolved cellular automata are
shown to be able to control chemical activity through dynamic control of the
light intensity. The approach is demonstrated through the creation of a number
of simple Boolean logic gates.

165,"Speed Optimization In Unplanned Traffic Using Bio-Inspired Computing And
  Population Knowledge Base","  Bio-Inspired Algorithms on Road Traffic Congestion and safety is a very
promising research problem. Searching for an efficient optimization method to
increase the degree of speed optimization and thereby increasing the traffic
Flow in an unplanned zone is a widely concerning issue. However, there has been
a limited research effort on the optimization of the lane usage with speed
optimization. The main objective of this article is to find avenues or
techniques in a novel way to solve the problem optimally using the knowledge
from analysis of speeds of vehicles, which, in turn will act as a guide for
design of lanes optimally to provide better optimized traffic. The accident
factors adjust the base model estimates for individual geometric design element
dimensions and for traffic control features. The application of these
algorithms in partially modified form in accordance of this novel Speed
Optimization Technique in an Unplanned Traffic analysis technique is applied to
the proposed design and speed optimization plan. The experimental results based
on real life data are quite encouraging.

166,"Diametrical Mesh Of Tree (D2D-MoT) Architecture: A Novel Routing
  Solution For NoC","  Network-on-chip (NoC) is a new aspect for designing of future System-On-Chips
(SoC) where a vast number of IP cores are connected through interconnection
network. The communication between the nodes occurred by routing packets rather
than wires. It supports high degree of scalability, reusability and parallelism
in communication. In this paper, we present a Mesh routing architecture, which
is called Diametrical 2D Mesh of Tree, based on Mesh-of-Tree (MoT) routing and
Diametrical 2D Mesh. It has the advantage of having small diameter as well as
large bisection width and small node degree clubbed with being the fastest
network in terms of speed. The routing algorithm ensures that the packets will
always reach from source to sink through shortest path and is deadlock free.
"
167,On beta-skeleton automata with memory,"  A \beta-skeleton is a proximity undirected graph whose connectivity is
determined by the parameter \beta. We study \beta-skeleton automata where every
node is a finite state machine taking two states, and updating its states
depending on the states of adjacent automata-nodes. We allow automata-nodes to
remember their previous states. In computational experiments we study how
memory affects the global space-time dynamics on \beta-skeleton automata.
"
168,Material Targets for Scaling All Spin Logic,"  All-spin logic devices are promising candidates to augment and complement
beyond-CMOS integrated circuit computing due to non-volatility, ultra-low
operating voltages, higher logical efficiency, and high density integration.
However, the path to reach lower energy-delay product performance compared to
CMOS transistors currently is not clear. We show that scaling and engineering
the nanoscale magnetic materials and interfaces is the key to realizing spin
logic devices that can surpass energy-delay performance of CMOS transistors.
With validated stochastic nano-magnetic and vector spin transport numerical
models, we derive the target material and interface properties for the
nanomagnets and channels. We identified promising new directions for material
engineering/discovery focusing on systematic scaling of magnetic anisotropy
(Hk) with saturation magnetization (Ms), use of perpendicular magnetic
anisotropy, and interface spin mixing conductance of ferromagnet/spin channel
interface (Gmix). We provide systematic targets for scaling spin logic
energy-delay product toward a 2 aJ.ns energy-delay product, comprehending the
stochastic noise for nanomagnets.
"
169,Organic Memristor Devices for Logic Elements with Memory,"  Memristors are promising next-generation memory candidates that are
nonvolatile, possess low power requirements and are capable of nanoscale
fabrication. In this article we physically realise and describe the use of
organic memristors in designing statefull boolean logic gates for the AND OR
and NOT operations. The output of these gates is analog and dependent on the
length of time that suitable charge is applied to the inputs, displaying a
learning property. Results may be also interpreted in a traditional binary
manner through use of a suitable thresholding function at the output. The
memristive property of the gate allows the for the production of analog outputs
that vary based on the charge-dependent nonvolatile state of the memristor. We
provide experimental results of physical fabrication of three types of logic
gate. A simulation of a one-bit full adder comprised of memristive logic gates
is also included, displaying varying response to two distinct input patterns.
"
170,"Evolution of Plastic Learning in Spiking Networks via Memristive
  Connections","  This article presents a spiking neuroevolutionary system which implements
memristors as plastic connections, i.e. whose weights can vary during a trial.
The evolutionary design process exploits parameter self-adaptation and variable
topologies, allowing the number of neurons, connection weights, and
inter-neural connectivity pattern to emerge. By comparing two phenomenological
real-world memristor implementations with networks comprised of (i) linear
resistors (ii) constant-valued connections, we demonstrate that this approach
allows the evolution of networks of appropriate complexity to emerge whilst
exploiting the memristive properties of the connections to reduce learning
time. We extend this approach to allow for heterogeneous mixtures of memristors
within the networks; our approach provides an in-depth analysis of network
structure. Our networks are evaluated on simulated robotic navigation tasks;
results demonstrate that memristive plasticity enables higher performance than
constant-weighted connections in both static and dynamic reward scenarios, and
that mixtures of memristive elements provide performance advantages when
compared to homogeneous memristive networks.
"
171,"Practical approximation of single-qubit unitaries by single-qubit
  quantum Clifford and T circuits","  We present an algorithm, along with its implementation that finds T-optimal
approximations of single-qubit Z-rotations using quantum circuits consisting of
Clifford and T gates. Our algorithm is capable of handling errors in
approximation down to size $10^{-15}$, resulting in optimal single-qubit
circuit designs required for implementation of scalable quantum algorithms. Our
implementation along with the experimental results are available in the public
domain.
"
172,Applications of fMRI for Brain Mapping,"  Brain-mapping techniques have proven to be vital in understanding the
molecular, cellular, and functional mechanisms of the brain. Normal anatomical
imaging can provide structural information on certain abnormalities in the
brain. However there are many neurological disorders for which only structure
studies are not sufficient. In such cases it is required to investigate the
functional organization of the brain. Further it is necessary to study the
brain functions under normal as well as diseased conditions. Brain mapping
techniques can help in deriving useful and important information on these
issues. Brain functions and brain area responsible for the particular
activities like motor, sensory speech and memory process could be investigated.
The authors provide an overview of various Brain Mapping techniques and fMRI
signal processing methods.
"
173,"Beyond electronics, beyond optics: single circuit parallel computing
  with phonons","  Phononic computing -- the use of (typically thermal) vibrations for
information processing -- is a nascent technology; its capabilities are still
being discovered. We analyze an alternative form of phononic computing inspired
by optical, rather than electronic, computing. Using the acoustic Faraday
effect, we design a phonon gyrator and thereby a means of performing
computation through the manipulation of polarization in transverse phonon
currents. Moreover, we establish that our gyrators act as generalized
transistors and can construct digital logic gates. Exploiting the wave nature
of phonons and the similarity of our logic gates, we demonstrate parallel
computation within a single circuit, an effect presently unique to phonons.
Finally, a generic method of designing these parallel circuits is introduced
and used to analyze the feasibility of magneto-acoustic materials in realizing
these circuits.
"
174,Faster Quantum Number Factoring via Circuit Synthesis,"  A major obstacle to implementing Shor's quantum number-factoring algorithm is
the large size of modular-exponentiation circuits. We reduce this bottleneck by
customizing reversible circuits for modular multiplication to individual runs
of Shor's algorithm. Our circuit-synthesis procedure exploits spectral
properties of multiplication operators and constructs optimized circuits from
the traces of the execution of an appropriate GCD algorithm. Empirically, gate
counts are reduced by 4-5 times, and circuit latency is reduced by larger
factors.
"
175,Cross-layer Optimization for Next Generation Wi-Fi,"  From the initial 1997 specification to the undergoing IEEE 802.11ac
standardization, a leap in throughput has been observed with every new
generation. The expectations for next generations on issues like throughput,
range, reliability, and power consumption are even higher. This is quite a
challenge considering all the work already done. Cross-layer optimization of
physical (PHY) and medium access control (MAC) layers can be an interesting
exploration path for further enhancement. During this thesis we have studied
cross-layer optimization techniques, with a focus on the IEEE 802.11ac
standard. A new multichannel aggregation scheme involving cross-knowledge
between PHY and MAC layers has been proposed to improve performance in
collision-prone environments. We have shown that some functionalities directly
involved PHY and MAC layers. An accurate modeling of both PHY and MAC
mechanisms is thus needed to have a realistic characterization of such
functionalities. A cross-layer simulator, compliant with IEEE 802.11ac
specifications, has thus been implemented. To the best of our knowledge, this
is the first simulator incorporating detailed PHY and MAC functionalities for
the IEEE 802.11ac standard. The multiple-user multiple-input, multiple-output
(MU-MIMO) technique, which is one of the main innovations of the IEEE 802.11ac,
needs both PHY and MAC layer considerations. We have thus used the implemented
cross-layer simulator to evaluate the performance of MU-MIMO and compared it
with the single-user MIMO (SU-MIMO). The aim of these studies was to evaluate
the 'real' gains of MU-MIMO solutions (accounting for PHY+MAC) over SU-MIMO
solutions and not the generally accepted ones. The impact of the channel
sounding interval has particularly been studied. Finally, we have proposed a
short PHY layer version of acknowledgment frames for overhead reduction in IEEE
802.11ah communications.
"
176,Thinking like Archimedes with a 3D printer,"  We illustrate Archimedes' method using models produced with 3D printers. This
approach allowed us to create physical proofs of results known to Archimedes
and illustrate ideas of a mathematician who is known both for his for his
mechanical inventions as well as his breakthroughs in geometry and calculus. We
use technology from the 21st century to trace intellectual achievements from
the 3rd century BC. While we celebrate the 2300th birthday of Archimedes
(287-212 BC) in 2013, we also live in an exciting time, where 3D printing is
becoming popular and affordable.
"
177,"Beyond Markov Chains, Towards Adaptive Memristor Network-based Music
  Generation","  We undertook a study of the use of a memristor network for music generation,
making use of the memristor's memory to go beyond the Markov hypothesis. Seed
transition matrices are created and populated using memristor equations, and
which are shown to generate musical melodies and change in style over time as a
result of feedback into the transition matrix. The spiking properties of simple
memristor networks are demonstrated and discussed with reference to
applications of music making. The limitations of simulating composing memristor
networks in von Neumann hardware is discussed and a hardware solution based on
physical memristor properties is presented.
"
178,"Optimal Power and Rate Allocation in the Degraded Gaussian Relay Channel
  with Energy Harvesting Nodes","  Energy Harvesting (EH) is a novel technique to prolong the lifetime of the
wireless networks such as wireless sensor networks or Ad-Hoc networks, by
providing an unlimited source of energy for their nodes. In this sense, it has
emerged as a promising technique for Green Communications, recently. On the
other hand, cooperative communication with the help of relay nodes improves the
performance of wireless communication networks by increasing the system
throughput or the reliability as well as the range and efficient energy
utilization. In order to investigate the cooperation in EH nodes, in this
paper, we consider the problem of optimal power and rate allocation in the
degraded full-duplex Gaussian relay channel in which source and relay can
harvest energy from their environments. We consider the general stochastic
energy arrivals at the source and the relay with known EH times and amounts at
the transmitters before the start of transmission. This problem has a min-max
optimization form that along with the constraints is not easy to solve. We
propose a method based on a mathematical theorem proposed by Terkelsen [1] to
transform it to a solvable convex optimization form. Also, we consider some
special cases for the harvesting profile of the source and the relay nodes and
find their solutions efficiently.
"
179,"Finite Horizon Adaptive Optimal Distributed Power Allocation for
  Enhanced Cognitive Radio Network in the Presence of Channel Uncertainties","  In this paper, novel enhanced Cognitive Radio Network is considered by using
power control where secondary users are allowed to use wireless resources of
the primary users when primary users are deactivated, but also allow secondary
users to coexist with primary users while primary users are activated by
managing interference caused from secondary users to primary users. Therefore,
a novel finite horizon adaptive optimal distributed power allocation scheme is
proposed by incorporating the effect of channel uncertainties for enhanced
cognitive radio network in the presence of wireless channel uncertainties under
two cases. In Case 1, proposed scheme can force the Signal-to-interference
(SIR) of the secondary users to converge to a higher target value for
increasing network throughput when primary users' are not communicating within
finite horizon. Once primary users are activated as in the Case 2, proposed
scheme can not only force the SIR of primary users to converge to a higher
target SIR, but also force the SIR of secondary users to converge to a lower
value for regulating their interference to Pus during finite time period. In
order to mitigate the attenuation of SIR due to channel uncertainties the
proposed novel finite horizon adaptive optimal distributed power allocation
allows the SIR of both primary users' and secondary users' to converge to a
desired target SIR while minimizing the energy consumption within finite
horizon. Simulation results illustrate that this novel finite horizon adaptive
optimal distributed power allocation scheme can converge much faster and cost
less energy than others by adapting to the channel variations optimally.
"
180,mrPUF: A Memristive Device based Physical Unclonable Function,"  Physical unclonable functions (PUFs) exploit the intrinsic complexity and
irreproducibility of physical systems to generate secret information. PUFs have
the potential to provide fundamentally higher security than traditional
cryptographic methods by preventing the cloning of identities and the
extraction of secret keys. One unique and exciting opportunity is that of using
the super-high information content (SHIC) capability of nanocrossbar
architecture as well as the high resistance programming variation of resistive
memories to develop a highly secure on-chip PUFs for extremely resource
constrained devices characterized by limited power and area budgets such as
passive Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) devices. We show how to implement
PUF based on nano-scale memristive (resistive memory) devices (mrPUF). Our
proposed architecture significantly increased the number of possible
challenge-response pairs (CRPs), while also consuming relatively lesser power
(around 70 uW). The presented approach can be used in other silicon-based PUFs
as well.
"
181,A Study on Spectral Efficiency of Physical Layer over Cognitive Radio,"  Despite the conclusive potential of cognitive radio for provisioning the
dynamic and flexible spectrum/channel allocation, the research community should
study the performance gain of physical layer over such a radio with cognition
capabilities. To this end, several mechanisms of physical layers such as
adaptive modulation, multiple-input multiple output antennas; channel coding
and/or combination of them should be studied. These studies should be
accomplished in terms of spectral efficiency. Therefore, the gain of cognitive
radio in wireless networks available into the market will be identified
practically. Another issue under consideration should be the performance
evaluation of cognitive radio assuming a cross-layer combination between the
cognitive physical and the upper layers. To this direction, this paper presents
a study on spectral efficiency at the physical layer with cognitive
capabilities. In sequel, we study a cross-layer combination of physical layer
with upper layers in the same cognitive context. The performance gain of
cognitive radio in such a physical layer is realized practically as well as a
few cross-layer design issues have been raised.
"
182,Exploration of Recent Advances in the Field of Brain Computer Interfaces,"  A new approach for implementing number of expressions, emotions and, actions
to operate objects through the thoughts of brain using a Non-Invasive Brain
Computing Interface (BCI) technique has been proposed. In this paper a survey
on brain and its operations are presented. The steps involved in the brain
signal processing are discussed. The current systems are able to present few
expressions and emotions on a single device. The proposed system provides the
extended number of expressions on multiple numbers of objects.
"
183,"Pavlov's dog associative learning demonstrated on synaptic-like organic
  transistors","  In this letter, we present an original demonstration of an associative
learning neural network inspired by the famous Pavlov's dogs experiment. A
single nanoparticle organic memory field effect transistor (NOMFET) is used to
implement each synapse. We show how the physical properties of this dynamic
memristive device can be used to perform low power write operations for the
learning and implement short-term association using temporal coding and spike
timing dependent plasticity based learning. An electronic circuit was built to
validate the proposed learning scheme with packaged devices, with good
reproducibility despite the complex synaptic-like dynamic of the NOMFET in
pulse regime.
"
184,Enhanced secure key exchange systems based on the Johnson-noise scheme,"  We introduce seven new versions of the Kirchhoff-Law-Johnson-(like)-Noise
(KLJN) classical physical secure key exchange scheme and a new transient
protocol for practically-perfect security. While these practical improvements
offer progressively enhanced security and/or speed for the non-ideal
conditions, the fundamental physical laws providing the security remain the
same.
  In the ""intelligent"" KLJN (iKLJN) scheme, Alice and Bob utilize the fact that
they exactly know not only their own resistor value but also the stochastic
time function of their own noise, which they generate before feeding it into
the loop.
  In the ""multiple"" KLJN (MKLJN) system, Alice and Bob have publicly known
identical sets of different resistors with a proper, publicly known truth table
about the bit-interpretation of their combination. In the ""keyed"" KLJN (KKLJN)
system, by using secure communication with a formerly shared key, Alice and Bob
share a proper time-dependent truth table for the bit-interpretation of the
resistor situation for each secure bit exchange step during generating the next
key.
  The remaining four KLJN schemes are the combinations of the above protocols
to synergically enhance the security properties. These are: the
""intelligent-multiple"" (iMKLJN), the ""intelligent-keyed"" (iKKLJN), the
""keyed-multiple"" (KMKLJN) and the ""intelligent-keyed-multiple"" (iKMKLJN) KLJN
key exchange systems.
  Finally, we introduce a new transient-protocol offering practically-perfect
security without privacy amplification, which is not needed at practical
applications but it is shown for the sake of ongoing discussions.

185,Dynamic Power Reduction in a Novel CMOS 5T-SRAM for Low-Power SoC,"  This paper addresses a novel five-transistor (5T) CMOS SRAM design with high
performance and reliability in 65nm CMOS, and illustrates how it reduces the
dynamic power consumption in comparison with the conventional and low-power 6T
SRAM counterparts. This design can be used as cache memory in processors and
low-power portable devices. The proposed SRAM cell features ~13% area reduction
compared to a conventional 6T cell, and features a unique bit-line and negative
supply voltage biasing methodology and ground control architecture to enhance
performance, and suppress standby leakage power.
"
186,Quantum-inspired Huffman Coding,"  Huffman Compression, also known as Huffman Coding, is one of many compression
techniques in use today. The two important features of Huffman coding are
instantaneousness that is the codes can be interpreted as soon as they are
received and variable length that is a most frequent symbol has length smaller
than a less frequent symbol. The traditional Huffman coding has two procedures:
constructing a tree in O(n^2) and then traversing it in O(n). Quantum computing
is a promising approach of computation that is based on equations from Quantum
Mechanics. Instantaneousness and variable length features are difficult to
generalize to the quantum case. The quantum coding field is pioneered by
Schumacher works on block coding scheme. To encode N signals sequentially, it
requires O(N3) computational steps. The encoding and decoding processes are far
from instantaneous. Moreover, the lengths of all the codewords are the same. A
Huffman-coding-inspired scheme for the storage of quantum information takes
O(N(log N)a) computational steps for a sequential implementation on
non-parallel machines.
"
187,"Q#, a quantum computation package for the .NET platform","  Quantum computing is a promising approach of computation that is based on
equations from Quantum Mechanics. A simulator for quantum algorithms must be
capable of performing heavy mathematical matrix transforms. The design of the
simulator itself takes one of three forms: Quantum Turing Machine, Network
Model or circuit model of connected gates or, Quantum Programming Language,
yet, some simulators are hybrid. We studied previous simulators and then we
adopt features from three simulators of different implementation languages,
different paradigms, and for different platforms. They are Quantum Computing
Language (QCL), QUASI, and Quantum Optics Toolbox for Matlab 5. Our simulator
for quantum algorithms takes the form of a package or a programming library for
Quantum computing, with a case study showing the ability of using it in the
circuit model. The .NET is a promising platform for computing. VB.NET is an
easy, high productive programming language with the full power and
functionality provided by the .NET framework. It is highly readable, writeable,
and flexible language, compared to another language such as C#.NET in many
aspects. We adopted VB.NET although its shortage in built-in mathematical
complex and matrix operations, compared to Matlab. For implementation, we first
built a mathematical core of matrix operations. Then, we built a quantum core
which contains: basic qubits and register operations, basic 1D, 2D, and 3D
quantum gates, and multi-view visualization of the quantum state, then a window
for demos to show you how to use and get the most of the package.
"
188,Reversible Logic Synthesis by Quantum Rotation Gates,"  A rotation-based synthesis framework for reversible logic is proposed. We
develop a canonical representation based on binary decision diagrams and
introduce operators to manipulate the developed representation model.
Furthermore, a recursive functional bi-decomposition approach is proposed to
automatically synthesize a given function. While Boolean reversible logic is
particularly addressed, our framework constructs intermediate quantum states
that may be in superposition, hence we combine techniques from reversible
Boolean logic and quantum computation. The proposed approach results in
quadratic gate count for multiple-control Toffoli gates without ancillae,
linear depth for quantum carry-ripple adder, and quasilinear size for quantum
multiplexer.
"
189,"Integration of nanoscale memristor synapses in neuromorphic computing
  architectures","  Conventional neuro-computing architectures and artificial neural networks
have often been developed with no or loose connections to neuroscience. As a
consequence, they have largely ignored key features of biological neural
processing systems, such as their extremely low-power consumption features or
their ability to carry out robust and efficient computation using massively
parallel arrays of limited precision, highly variable, and unreliable
components. Recent developments in nano-technologies are making available
extremely compact and low-power, but also variable and unreliable solid-state
devices that can potentially extend the offerings of availing CMOS
technologies. In particular, memristors are regarded as a promising solution
for modeling key features of biological synapses due to their nanoscale
dimensions, their capacity to store multiple bits of information per element
and the low energy required to write distinct states. In this paper, we first
review the neuro- and neuromorphic-computing approaches that can best exploit
the properties of memristor and-scale devices, and then propose a novel hybrid
memristor-CMOS neuromorphic circuit which represents a radical departure from
conventional neuro-computing approaches, as it uses memristors to directly
emulate the biophysics and temporal dynamics of real synapses. We point out the
differences between the use of memristors in conventional neuro-computing
architectures and the hybrid memristor-CMOS circuit proposed, and argue how
this circuit represents an ideal building block for implementing brain-inspired
probabilistic computing paradigms that are robust to variability and
fault-tolerant by design.

190,"Polynomial-time T-depth Optimization of Clifford+T circuits via Matroid
  Partitioning","  Most work in quantum circuit optimization has been performed in isolation
from the results of quantum fault-tolerance. Here we present a polynomial-time
algorithm for optimizing quantum circuits that takes the actual implementation
of fault-tolerant logical gates into consideration. Our algorithm
re-synthesizes quantum circuits composed of Clifford group and T gates, the
latter being typically the most costly gate in fault-tolerant models, e.g.,
those based on the Steane or surface codes, with the purpose of minimizing both
T-count and T-depth. A major feature of the algorithm is the ability to
re-synthesize circuits with additional ancillae to reduce T-depth at
effectively no cost. The tested benchmarks show up to 65.7% reduction in
T-count and up to 87.6% reduction in T-depth without ancillae, or 99.7%
reduction in T-depth using ancillae.
"
191,Linear-Depth Quantum Circuits for n-qubit Toffoli gates with no Ancilla,"  We design a circuit structure with linear depth to implement an $n$-qubit
Toffoli gate. The proposed construction uses a quadratic-size circuit consists
of elementary 2-qubit controlled-rotation gates around the x axis and uses no
ancilla qubit. Circuit depth remains linear in quantum technologies with
finite-distance interactions between qubits. The suggested construction is
related to the long-standing construction by Barenco et al. (Phys. Rev. A, 52:
3457-3467, 1995, arXiv:quant-ph/9503016), which uses a quadratic-size,
quadratic-depth quantum circuit for an $n$-qubit Toffoli gate.
"
192,Overview of Optical Interconnect Technology,"  Optical interconnect is seen as a potential solution to meet the performance
requirements of current and future generation of data processors. Optical
interconnects have negligible frequency dependent loss, low cross talk and high
band width. Optical interconnects are not much used commercially since optical
interconnects technology is incompatible with manufacturing processes and
assembly methods that are currently used in the semiconductor industry. There
are many promising optical interconnect technologies and this paper presents a
brief analysis of current state of optical interconnect technology.
"
193,FreeIMU: An Open Hardware Framework for Orientation and Motion Sensing,"  Orientation and Motion Sensing are widely implemented on various consumer
products, such as mobile phones, tablets and cameras as they enable immediate
interaction with virtual information. The prototyping phase of any orientation
and motion sensing capable device is however a quite difficult process as it
may involve complex hardware designing, math algorithms and programming.
  In this paper, we present FreeIMU, an Open Hardware Framework for prototyping
orientation and motion sensing capable devices. The framework consists in a
small circuit board containing various sensors and a software library, built on
top of the Arduino platform. Both the hardware and library are released under
open licences and supported by an active community allowing to be implemented
into research and commercial projects.
"
194,Computation of the Travelling Salesman Problem by a Shrinking Blob,"  The Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a well known and challenging
combinatorial optimisation problem. Its computational intractability has
attracted a number of heuristic approaches to generate satisfactory, if not
optimal, candidate solutions. In this paper we demonstrate a simple
unconventional computation method to approximate the Euclidean TSP using a
virtual material approach. The morphological adaptation behaviour of the
material emerges from the low-level interactions of a population of particles
moving within a diffusive lattice. A `blob' of this material is placed over a
set of data points projected into the lattice, representing TSP city locations,
and the blob is reduced in size over time. As the blob shrinks it
morphologically adapts to the configuration of the cities. The shrinkage
process automatically stops when the blob no longer completely covers all
cities. By manually tracing the perimeter of the blob a path between cities is
elicited corresponding to a TSP tour. Over 6 runs on 20 randomly generated
datasets of 20 cities this simple and unguided method found tours with a mean
best tour length of 1.04, mean average tour length of 1.07 and mean worst tour
length of 1.09 when expressed as a fraction of the minimal tour computed by an
exact TSP solver. We examine the insertion mechanism by which the blob
constructs a tour, note some properties and limitations of its performance, and
discuss the relationship between the blob TSP and proximity graphs which group
points on the plane. The method is notable for its simplicity and the spatially
represented mechanical mode of its operation. We discuss similarities between
this method and previously suggested models of human performance on the TSP and
suggest possibilities for further improvement.

195,"On Mobile DNA in Artificial Regulatory Networks: Evolving Functional and
  Structural Dynamism","  There is a growing body of work considering the use of representations based
upon genetic regulatory networks. This paper uses a recently presented
abstract, tunable Boolean regulatory network model to explore aspects of mobile
DNA, such as transposons, within these dynamical systems. The significant role
of mobile DNA in the evolution of natural systems is becoming increasingly
clear. Whilst operators loosely based upon transposons have previously been
used within evolutionary computation, their use within regulatory network
representations enables the potential exploitation of numerous new mechanisms.
This paper shows how dynamically controlling network node connectivity and
function via transposon-inspired mechanisms can be selected for under
non-stationary and coevolutionary scenarios, including when such changes are
heritable.

196,"Constant-Factor Optimization of Quantum Adders on 2D Quantum
  Architectures","  Quantum arithmetic circuits have practical applications in various quantum
algorithms. In this paper, we address quantum addition on 2-dimensional
nearest-neighbor architectures based on the work presented by Choi and Van
Meter (JETC 2012). To this end, we propose new circuit structures for some
basic blocks in the adder, and reduce communication overhead by adding
concurrency to consecutive blocks and also by parallel execution of expensive
Toffoli gates. The proposed optimizations reduce total depth from $140\sqrt
n+k_1$ to $92\sqrt n+k_2$ for constants $k_1,k_2$ and affect the computation
fidelity considerably.
"
197,"Self-organization and solution of shortest-path optimization problems
  with memristive networks","  We show that memristive networks-namely networks of resistors with memory-can
efficiently solve shortest-path optimization problems. Indeed, the presence of
memory (time non-locality) promotes self organization of the network into the
shortest possible path(s). We introduce a network entropy function to
characterize the self-organized evolution, show the solution of the
shortest-path problem and demonstrate the healing property of the solution
path. Finally, we provide an algorithm to solve the traveling salesman problem.
Similar considerations apply to networks of memcapacitors and meminductors, and
networks with memory in various dimensions.

198,On Creativity of Slime Mould,"  Slime mould Physarum polycephalum is large single cell with intriguingly
smart behaviour. The slime mould shows outstanding abilities to adapt its
protoplasmic network to varying environmental conditions. The slime mould can
solve tasks of computational geometry, image processing, logics and arithmetics
when data are represented by configurations of attractants and repellents. We
attempt to map behavioural patterns of slime onto the cognitive control versus
schizotypy spectrum phase space and thus interpret slime mould's activity in
terms of creativity.

199,"Spintronic Switches for Ultra Low Energy On-Chip and Inter-Chip
  Current-Mode Interconnects","  Energy-efficiency and design-complexity of high-speed on-chip and inter-chip
data-interconnects has emerged as the major bottleneck for high-performance
computing-systems. As a solution, we propose an ultra-low energy interconnect
design-scheme using nano-scale spintorque switches. In the proposed method,
data is transmitted in the form of current-pulses, with amplitude of the order
of few micro-amperes that flows across a small terminal-voltage of less than
50mV. Sub-nanosecond spintorque switching of scaled nano-magnets can be used to
receive and convert such high-speed current-mode signal into binary
voltage-levels using magnetic-tunnel-junction (MTJ), with the help of simple
CMOS inverter. As a result of low-voltage, low-current signaling and minimal
signal-conversion overhead, the proposed technique can facilitate highly
compact and simplified designs for multi-gigahertz inter-chip and on-chip
data-communication links. Such links can achieve more than ~100x higher
energy-efficiency, as compared to state of the art CMOS interconnects.
"
200,"Ultra Low Power Associative Computing with Spin Neurons and Resistive
  Crossbar Memory","  Emerging resistive-crossbar memory (RCM) technology can be promising for
computationally-expensive analog pattern-matching tasks. However, the use of
CMOS analog-circuits with RCM would result in large power-consumption and poor
scalability, thereby eschewing the benefits of RCM-based computation. We
propose the use of low-voltage, fast-switching, magneto-metallic spin-neurons
for ultra low-power non-Boolean computing with RCM. We present the design of
analog associative memory for face recognition using RCM, where, substituting
conventional analog circuits with spin-neurons can achieve ~100x lower power.
This makes the proposed design ~1000x more energy-efficient than a 45nm-CMOS
digital ASIC, thereby significantly enhancing the prospects of RCM based
computational hardware.
"
201,Quipper: A Scalable Quantum Programming Language,"  The field of quantum algorithms is vibrant. Still, there is currently a lack
of programming languages for describing quantum computation on a practical
scale, i.e., not just at the level of toy problems. We address this issue by
introducing Quipper, a scalable, expressive, functional, higher-order quantum
programming language. Quipper has been used to program a diverse set of
non-trivial quantum algorithms, and can generate quantum gate representations
using trillions of gates. It is geared towards a model of computation that uses
a classical computer to control a quantum device, but is not dependent on any
particular model of quantum hardware. Quipper has proven effective and easy to
use, and opens the door towards using formal methods to analyze quantum
algorithms.

202,"Global cognitive radio based communication systems: Space-time
  communications","  Spectrum Scarcity is a global problem across the world. This paper emphasizes
on the fact that a global problem has to be dealt on global basis, not just
locally by applying the principle of global cognitive radio,Global
Opportunistic Remote Spectrum Access. The Future Internet and Internet of
Things literally scare the communication system designer regarding the
available bandwidth and spectrum resources. There is absolutely no scope to
waste or under utilize the available resources. Hence the proposed idea of
Global Cognitive Radio Concept can undoubtedly solve the resource problems in
next Generation Communications.
"
203,Smart Microgrids: Overview and Outlook,"  The idea of changing our energy system from a hierarchical design into a set
of nearly independent microgrids becomes feasible with the availability of
small renewable energy generators. The smart microgrid concept comes with
several challenges in research and engineering targeting load balancing,
pricing, consumer integration and home automation. In this paper we first
provide an overview on these challenges and present approaches that target the
problems identified. While there exist promising algorithms for the particular
field, we see a missing integration which specifically targets smart
microgrids. Therefore, we propose an architecture that integrates the presented
approaches and defines interfaces between the identified components such as
generators, storage, smart and \dq{dumb} devices.
"
204,Planning of Cellular Networks Enhanced by Energy Harvesting,"  We pose a novel cellular network planning problem, considering the use of
renewable energy sources and a fundamentally new concept of energy balancing,
and propose a novel algorithm to solve it. In terms of the network capital and
operational expenditure, we conclude that savings can be made by enriching
cellular infrastructure with energy harvesting sources, in comparison to
traditional deployment methods.
"
205,An Introduction to Quantum Programming in Quipper,"  Quipper is a recently developed programming language for expressing quantum
computations. This paper gives a brief tutorial introduction to the language,
through a demonstration of how to make use of some of its key features. We
illustrate many of Quipper's language features by developing a few well known
examples of Quantum computation, including quantum teleportation, the quantum
Fourier transform, and a quantum circuit for addition.
"
206,"Nanoscale photonic network for solution searching and decision making
  problems","  Nature-inspired devices and architectures are attracting considerable
attention for various purposes, including the development of novel computing
techniques based on spatiotemporal dynamics, exploiting stochastic processes
for computing, and reducing energy dissipation. This paper demonstrates that
networks of optical energy transfers between quantum nanostructures mediated by
optical near-field interactions occurring at scales far below the wavelength of
light could be utilized for solving a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP),
the satisfiability problem (SAT), and a decision making problem. The optical
energy transfer from smaller quantum dots to larger ones, which is a quantum
stochastic process, depends on the existence of resonant energy levels between
the quantum dots or a state-filling effect occurring at the larger quantum
dots. Such a spatiotemporal mechanism yields different evolutions of energy
transfer patterns in multi-quantum-dot systems. We numerically demonstrate that
networks of optical energy transfers can be used for solution searching and
decision making. We consider that such an approach paves the way to a novel
physical informatics in which both coherent and dissipative processes are
exploited, with low energy consumption.
"
207,"An Efficient MAC Protocol with Selective Grouping and Cooperative
  Sensing in Cognitive Radio Networks","  In cognitive radio networks, spectrum sensing is a crucial technique to
discover spectrum opportunities for the Secondary Users (SUs). The quality of
spectrum sensing is evaluated by both sensing accuracy and sensing efficiency.
Here, sensing accuracy is represented by the false alarm probability and the
detection probability while sensing efficiency is represented by the sensing
overhead and network throughput. In this paper, we propose a group-based
cooperative Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol called GC-MAC, which addresses
the tradeoff between sensing accuracy and efficiency. In GC-MAC, the
cooperative SUs are grouped into several teams. During a sensing period, each
team senses a different channel while SUs in the same team perform the joint
detection on the targeted channel. The sensing process will not stop unless an
available channel is discovered. To reduce the sensing overhead, an
SU-selecting algorithm is presented to selectively choose the cooperative SUs
based on the channel dynamics and usage patterns. Then, an analytical model is
built to study the sensing accuracy-efficiency tradeoff under two types of
channel conditions: time-invariant channel and time-varying channel. An
optimization problem that maximizes achievable throughput is formulated to
optimize the important design parameters. Both saturation and non-saturation
situations are investigated with respect to throughput and sensing overhead.
Simulation results indicate that the proposed protocol is able to significantly
decrease sensing overhead and increase network throughput with guaranteed
sensing accuracy.
"
208,"Stochastic Memristive Devices for Computing and Neuromorphic
  Applications","  Nanoscale resistive switching devices (memristive devices or memristors) have
been studied for a number of applications ranging from non-volatile memory,
logic to neuromorphic systems. However a major challenge is to address the
potentially large variations in space and in time in these nanoscale devices.
Here we show that in metal-filament based memristive devices the switching can
be fully stochastic. While individual switching events are random, the
distribution and probability of switching can be well predicted and controlled.
Rather than trying to force high switching probabilities using excessive
voltage or time, the inherent stochastic nature of resistive switching allows
these binary devices to be used as building blocks for novel error-tolerant
computing schemes such as stochastic computing and provide a needed ""analog""
feature in neuromorphic applications. To verify such potential, we demonstrated
memristor-based stochastic bitstreams in both time and space domains, and show
that an array of binary memristors can act as a multi-level ""analog"" device for
neuromorphic applications.
"
209,"Learning and Spatiotemporally Correlated Functions Mimicked in
  Oxide-Based Artificial Synaptic Transistors","  Learning and logic are fundamental brain functions that make the individual
to adapt to the environment, and such functions are established in human brain
by modulating ionic fluxes in synapses. Nanoscale ionic/electronic devices with
inherent synaptic functions are considered to be essential building blocks for
artificial neural networks. Here, Multi-terminal IZO-based artificial synaptic
transistors gated by fast proton-conducting phosphosilicate electrolytes are
fabricated on glass substrates. Proton in the SiO2 electrolyte and IZO channel
conductance are regarded as the neurotransmitter and synaptic weight,
respectively. Spike-timing dependent plasticity, short-term memory and
long-term memory were successfully mimicked in such protonic/electronic hybrid
artificial synapses. And most importantly, spatiotemporally correlated logic
functions are also mimicked in a simple artificial neural network without any
intentional hard-wire connections due to the naturally proton-related coupling
effect. The oxide-based protonic/electronic hybrid artificial synaptic
transistors reported here are potential building blocks for artificial neural
networks.

210,"Quantum Circuits for GCD Computation with $O(n \log n)$ Depth and O(n)
  Ancillae","  GCD computations and variants of the Euclidean algorithm enjoy broad uses in
both classical and quantum algorithms. In this paper, we propose quantum
circuits for GCD computation with $O(n \log n)$ depth with O(n) ancillae. Prior
circuit construction needs $O(n^2)$ running time with O(n) ancillae. The
proposed construction is based on the binary GCD algorithm and it benefits from
log-depth circuits for 1-bit shift, comparison/subtraction, and managing
ancillae. The worst-case gate count remains $O(n^2)$, as in traditional
circuits.
"
211,"Accurate and Robust Indoor Localization Systems using Ultra-wideband
  Signals","  Indoor localization systems that are accurate and robust with respect to
propagation channel conditions are still a technical challenge today. In
particular, for systems based on range measurements from radio signals,
non-line-of-sight (NLOS) situations can result in large position errors. In
this paper, we address these issues using measurements in a representative
indoor environment. Results show that conventional tracking schemes using high-
and a low-complexity ranging algorithms are strongly impaired by NLOS
conditions unless a very large signal bandwidth is used. Furthermore, we
discuss and evaluate the performance of multipath-assisted indoor navigation
and tracking (MINT), that can overcome these impairments by making use of
multipath propagation. Across a wide range of bandwidths, MINT shows superior
performance compared to conventional schemes, and virtually no degradation in
its robustness due to NLOS conditions.

212,"Bio-imitaiton of Mexican migration routes to the USA with slime mould on
  3D terrains","  Plasmodium of Physarum polycephalum is a large single cell visible by unaided
eye. It shows sophisticated behavioural traits in foraging for nutrients and
developing an optimal transport network of protoplasmic tubes spanning sources
of nutrients. When placed in an environment with distributed sources of
nutrients the cell 'computes' an optimal graph spanning the nutrients by
growing a network of protoplasmic tubes. P. polycephalum imitates development
of man-made transport networks of a country when configuration of nutrients
represents major urban areas. We employ this feature of the slime mould to
imitate mexican migration to USA. The Mexican migration to USA is the World's
largest migration system. We bio-physically imitate the migration using slime
mould P. polycephalum. In laboratory experiments with 3D Nylon terrains of USA
we imitated development of migratory routes from Mexico-USA border to ten urban
areas with high concentration of Mexican migrants. From results of laboratory
experiments we extracted topologies of migratory routes, and highlighted a role
of elevations in shaping the human movement networks.
"
213,Optimization of Clifford Circuits,"  We study optimal synthesis of Clifford circuits, and apply the results to
peep-hole optimization of quantum circuits. We report optimal circuits for all
Clifford operations with up to four inputs. We perform peep-hole optimization
of Clifford circuits with up to 40 inputs found in the literature, and
demonstrate the reduction in the number of gates by about 50%. We extend our
methods to the optimal synthesis of linear reversible circuits, partially
specified Clifford functions, and optimal Clifford circuits with five inputs up
to input/output permutation. The results find their application in randomized
benchmarking protocols, quantum error correction, and quantum circuit
optimization.
"
214,"Improving Receiver Performance of Diffusive Molecular Communication with
  Enzymes","  This paper studies the mitigation of intersymbol interference in a diffusive
molecular communication system using enzymes that freely diffuse in the
propagation environment. The enzymes form reaction intermediates with
information molecules and then degrade them so that they cannot interfere with
future transmissions. A lower bound expression on the expected number of
molecules measured at the receiver is derived. A simple binary receiver
detection scheme is proposed where the number of observed molecules is sampled
at the time when the maximum number of molecules is expected. Insight is also
provided into the selection of an appropriate bit interval. The expected bit
error probability is derived as a function of the current and all previously
transmitted bits. Simulation results show the accuracy of the bit error
probability expression and the improvement in communication performance by
having active enzymes present.
"
215,"SECA: Snapshot-based Event Detection for Checking Asynchronous Context
  Consistency in Ubiquitous Computing","  Context-consistency checking is challenging in the dynamic and uncertain
ubiquitous computing environments. This is because contexts are often noisy
owing to unreliable sensing data streams, inaccurate data measurement, fragile
connectivity and resource constraints. One of the state-of-the-art efforts is
CEDA, which concurrently detects context consistency by exploring the
\emph{happened-before} relation among events. However, CEDA is seriously
limited by several side effects --- centralized detection manner that easily
gets down the checker process, heavy computing complexity and false negative.
  In this paper, we propose SECA: Snapshot-based Event Detection for Checking
Asynchronous Context Consistency in ubiquitous computing. SECA introduces
snapshot-based timestamp to check event relations, which can detect scenarios
where CEDA fails. Moreover, it simplifies the logical clock instead of adopting
the vector clock, and thus significantly reduces both time and space
complexity. Empirical studies show that SECA outperforms CEDA in terms of
detection accuracy, scalability, and computing complexity.

216,"Errors and their mitigation at the Kirchhoff-law-Johnson-noise secure
  key exchange","  A method to quantify the error probability at the Kirchhoff-law-Johnson-noise
(KLJN) secure key exchange is introduced. The types of errors due to
statistical inaccuracies in noise voltage measurements are classified and the
error probability is calculated. The most interesting finding is that the error
probability decays exponentially with the duration of the time window of single
bit exchange. The results indicate that it is feasible to have so small error
probabilities of the exchanged bits that error correction algorithms are not
required. The results are demonstrated with practical considerations.

217,"The Story of Telebrain: A multi-performer telematic platform for
  performatization","  This paper presents Telebrain, a browser-based performatization platform
invented for organizing real-time telematic performances. Performatization is
the human performance of algorithms. When computers and humans performatize
cooperatively, the human-computer interaction (HCI) becomes the location of
computation. Novel modes of machine-human communication are necessary for
organizing performatizations. Telebrain is designed to facilitate machine-human

218,Slime mould tactile sensor,"  Slime mould P. polycephalum is a single cells visible by unaided eye. The
cells shows a wide spectrum of intelligent behaviour. By interpreting the
behaviour in terms of computation one can make a slime mould based computing
device. The Physarum computers are capable to solve a range of tasks of
computational geometry, optimisation and logic. Physarum computers designed so
far lack of localised inputs. Commonly used inputs --- illumination and
chemo-attractants and -repellents --- usually act on extended domains of the
slime mould's body. Aiming to design massive-parallel tactile inputs for slime
mould computers we analyse a temporal dynamic of P. polycephalum's electrical
response to tactile stimulation. In experimental laboratory studies we discover
how the Physarum responds to application and removal of a local mechanical
pressure with electrical potential impulses and changes in its electrical
potential oscillation patterns.

219,DNA Pen: A Tool for Drawing on a Molecular Canvas,"  DNA origami is an interdisciplinary area where DNA can be used as a building
block for making useful stuff at nanoscale. This work presents an open source
software DNA pen (based on the recent work of Peng Yin and his group) which can
be used (using free hand and digital molecular canvas) to draw an object at
nanoscale. Software generates error free DNA sequences which can be used in the
wet lab to create the object at the nanoscale. Using DNA pen we have drawn
several objects including the map of India and sanskrit letter ""Om"" from free
hand molecular canvas and digital letter DNA using digitized molecular canvas.
"
220,"Finding Numerical Solutions of Diophantine Equations using Ant Colony
  Optimization","  The paper attempts to find numerical solutions of Diophantine equations, a
challenging problem as there are no general methods to find solutions of such
equations. It uses the metaphor of foraging habits of real ants. The ant colony
optimization based procedure starts with randomly assigned locations to a fixed
number of artificial ants. Depending upon the quality of these positions, ants
deposit pheromone at the nodes. A successor node is selected from the
topological neighborhood of each of the nodes based on this stochastic
pheromone deposit. If an ant bumps into an already encountered node, the
pheromone is updated correspondingly. A suitably defined pheromone evaporation
strategy guarantees that premature convergence does not take place. The
experimental results, which compares with those of other machine intelligence
techniques, validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

221,"A quantum circuit to find discrete logarithms on ordinary binary
  elliptic curves in depth O(log^2 n)","  Improving over an earlier construction by Kaye and Zalka, Maslov et al.
describe an implementation of Shor's algorithm which can solve the discrete
logarithm problem on binary elliptic curves in quadratic depth O(n^2). In this
paper we show that discrete logarithms on such curves can be found with a
quantum circuit of depth O(log^2 n). As technical tools we introduce quantum
circuits for GF(2^n) multiplication in depth O(log n) and for GF(2^n) inversion
in depth O(log^2 n).

222,A Single Universal n-bit Gate for Reversible Circuit Synthesis,"  Many universal reversible libraries that contain more than one gate type have
been proposed in the literature. Practical implementation of reversible
circuits is much easier if a single gate type is used in the circuit
construction. This paper proposes a reversible n-bit gate that is universal for
reversible circuits synthesis. The proposed gate is extendable according to the
size of the circuit. The paper shows that the size of the synthesized circuits
using the proposed gate is comparable with the size of the synthesized circuits
using the hybrid reversible libraries for 3-in/out reversible circuits.
"
223,A Quantum Physical Design Flow Using ILP and Graph Drawing,"  Implementing large-scale quantum circuits is one of the challenges of quantum
computing. One of the central challenges of accurately modeling the
architecture of these circuits is to schedule a quantum application and
generate the layout while taking into account the cost of communications and
classical resources as well as the maximum exploitable parallelism. In this
paper, we present and evaluate a design flow for arbitrary quantum circuits in
ion trap technology. Our design flow consists of two parts. First, a scheduler
takes a description of a circuit and finds the best order for the execution of
its quantum gates using integer linear programming (ILP) regarding the
classical resources (qubits) and instruction dependencies. Then a layout
generator receives the schedule produced by the scheduler and generates a
layout for this circuit using a graph-drawing algorithm. Our experimental
results show that the proposed flow decreases the average latency of quantum
circuits by about 11% for a set of attempted benchmarks and by about 9% for
another set of benchmarks compared with the best in literature.
"
224,Slimy hairs: Hair sensors made with slime mould,"  Slime mould Physarum polycephalum is a large single cell visible by unaided
eye. We design a slime mould implementation of a tactile hair, where the slime
mould responds to repeated deflection of hair by an immediate high-amplitude
spike and a prolonged increase in amplitude and width of its oscillation
impulses. We demonstrate that signal-to-noise ratio of the Physarum tactile
hair sensor averages near six for the immediate response and two for the
prolonged response.
"
225,Synthesis of unitaries with Clifford+T circuits,"  We describe a new method for approximating an arbitrary $n$ qubit unitary
with precision $\varepsilon$ using a Clifford and T circuit with
$O(4^{n}n(\log(1/\varepsilon)+n))$ gates. The method is based on rounding off a
unitary to a unitary over the ring $\mathbb{Z}[i,1/\sqrt{2}]$ and employing
exact synthesis. We also show that any $n$ qubit unitary over the ring
$\mathbb{Z}[i,1/\sqrt{2}]$ with entries of the form
$(a+b\sqrt{2}+ic+id\sqrt{2})/2^{k}$ can be exactly synthesized using
$O(4^{n}nk)$ Clifford and T gates using two ancillary qubits. This new exact
synthesis algorithm is an improvement over the best known exact synthesis
method by B. Giles and P. Selinger requiring $O(3^{2^{n}}nk)$ elementary gates.
"
226,Slime Mould Memristors,"  In laboratory experiments we demonstrate that protoplasmic tubes of acellular
slime mould \emph{Physarum polycephalum} show current versus voltage profiles
consistent with memristive systems and that the effect is due to the living
protoplasm of the mould. This complements previous findings on memristive
properties of other living systems (human skin and blood) and contributes to
development of self-growing bio-electronic circuits. Distinctive asymmetric
$V$-$I$ curves which were occasionally observed when the internal current is on
the same order as the driven current, are well-modelled by the concept of
active memristors.
"
227,Fault-tolerant Operations for Universal Blind Quantum Computation,"  Blind quantum computation is an appealing use of quantum information
technology because it can conceal both the client's data and the algorithm
itself from the server. However, problems need to be solved in the practical
use of blind quantum computation and fault-tolerance is a major challenge. On
an example circuit, the computational cost measured in T gates executed by the
client is 97 times more than performing the original computation directly,
without using the server, even before applying error correction. (The client
still benefits due to drastically reduced memory requirements.) Broadbent et
al. proposed running error correction over blind computation, but our first
protocol applies one layer of Steane's [[7,1,3]] code underneath instead. This
protocol has better fault tolerance, but still results in a substantial
overhead. We propose another protocol to reduce the client's computational load
by transferring the qubit preparation to the server. For each logical qubit
used in the computation, the client is only required to receive eight logical
qubits via teleportation then buffer two logical qubits before returning one.
This protocol also protects the client's fault-tolerant preparation of logical
qubits from a side-channel attack.
"
228,"A Space-Efficient Design for Reversible Floating Point Adder in Quantum
  Computing","  Reversible logic has applications in low-power computing and quantum
computing. However, there are few existing designs for reversible
floating-point adders and none suitable for quantum computation. In this paper
we propose a space-efficient reversible floating-point adder, suitable for
binary quantum computation, improving the design of Nachtigal et al. Our work
focuses on improving the reversible designs of the alignment unit and the
normalization unit, which are the most expensive parts. By changing a few
elements of the existing algorithm, including the circuit designs of the RLZC
(reversible leading zero counter) and converter, we have reduced the cost about
68%. We also propose fault-tolerant designs for the circuits. The KQ for our
fault-tolerant design is almost sixty times as expensive as for a 32-bit
fixed-point addition. We note that the floating-point representation makes
in-place, truly reversible arithmetic impossible, requiring us to retain both
inputs, which limits the sustainability of its use for quantum computation.
"
229,"A temporal logic approach to modular design of synthetic biological
  circuits","  We present a new approach for the design of a synthetic biological circuit
whose behaviour is specified in terms of signal temporal logic (STL) formulae.
We first show how to characterise with STL formulae the input/output behaviour
of biological modules miming the classical logical gates (AND, NOT, OR). Hence,
we provide the regions of the parameter space for which these specifications
are satisfied. Given a STL specification of the target circuit to be designed
and the networks of its constituent components, we propose a methodology to
constrain the behaviour of each module, then identifying the subset of the
parameter space in which those constraints are satisfied, providing also a
measure of the robustness for the target circuit design. This approach, which
leverages recent results on the quantitative semantics of Signal Temporal
Logic, is illustrated by synthesising a biological implementation of an
half-adder.

230,"Signal Transmission Across Tile Assemblies: 3D Static Tiles Simulate
  Active Self-Assembly by 2D Signal-Passing Tiles","  The 2-Handed Assembly Model (2HAM) is a tile-based self-assembly model in
which, typically beginning from single tiles, arbitrarily large aggregations of
static tiles combine in pairs to form structures. The Signal-passing Tile
Assembly Model (STAM) is an extension of the 2HAM in which the tiles are
dynamically changing components which are able to alter their binding domains
as they bind together. For our first result, we demonstrate useful techniques
and transformations for converting an arbitrarily complex STAM$^+$ tile set
into an STAM$^+$ tile set where every tile has a constant, low amount of
complexity, in terms of the number and types of ``signals'' they can send, with
a trade off in scale factor.
  Using these simplifications, we prove that for each temperature $\tau>1$
there exists a 3D tile set in the 2HAM which is intrinsically universal for the
class of all 2D STAM$^+$ systems at temperature $\tau$ (where the STAM$^+$ does
not make use of the STAM's power of glue deactivation and assembly breaking, as
the tile components of the 2HAM are static and unable to change or break
bonds). This means that there is a single tile set $U$ in the 3D 2HAM which
can, for an arbitrarily complex STAM$^+$ system $S$, be configured with a
single input configuration which causes $U$ to exactly simulate $S$ at a scale
factor dependent upon $S$. Furthermore, this simulation uses only two planes of
the third dimension. This implies that there exists a 3D tile set at
temperature $2$ in the 2HAM which is intrinsically universal for the class of
all 2D STAM$^+$ systems at temperature $1$. Moreover, we show that for each
temperature $\tau>1$ there exists an STAM$^+$ tile set which is intrinsically
universal for the class of all 2D STAM$^+$ systems at temperature $\tau$,
including the case where $\tau = 1$.

231,RFID Technology Based Attendance Management System,"  RFID is a nascent technology, deeply rooted by its early developments in
using radar1 as a harbinger of adversary planes during World War II. A plethora
of industries have leveraged the benefits of RFID technology for enhancements
in sectors like military, sports, security, airline, animal farms, healthcare
and other areas. Industry specific key applications of this technology include
vehicle tracking, automated inventory management, animal monitoring, secure

"
232,DNA Reservoir Computing: A Novel Molecular Computing Approach,"  We propose a novel molecular computing approach based on reservoir computing.
In reservoir computing, a dynamical core, called a reservoir, is perturbed with
an external input signal while a readout layer maps the reservoir dynamics to a
target output. Computation takes place as a transformation from the input space
to a high-dimensional spatiotemporal feature space created by the transient
dynamics of the reservoir. The readout layer then combines these features to
produce the target output. We show that coupled deoxyribozyme oscillators can
act as the reservoir. We show that despite using only three coupled
oscillators, a molecular reservoir computer could achieve 90% accuracy on a
benchmark temporal problem.

233,Dynamic Computing Random Access Memory,"  The present von Neumann computing paradigm involves a significant amount of
information transfer between a central processing unit (CPU) and memory, with
concomitant limitations in the actual execution speed. However, it has been
recently argued that a different form of computation, dubbed memcomputing
[Nature Physics, 9, 200-202 (2013)] and inspired by the operation of our brain,
can resolve the intrinsic limitations of present day architectures by allowing
for computing and storing of information on the same physical platform. Here we
show a simple and practical realization of memcomputing that utilizes
easy-to-build memcapacitive systems. We name this architecture Dynamic
Computing Random Access Memory (DCRAM). We show that DCRAM provides
massively-parallel and polymorphic digital logic, namely it allows for
different logic operations with the same architecture, by varying only the
control signals. In addition, by taking into account realistic parameters, its
energy expenditures can be as low as a few fJ per operation. DCRAM is fully
compatible with CMOS technology, can be realized with current fabrication
facilities, and therefore can really serve as an alternative to the present
computing technology.

234,Movers and Shakers: Kinetic Energy Harvesting for the Internet of Things,"  Numerous energy harvesting wireless devices that will serve as building
blocks for the Internet of Things (IoT) are currently under development.
However, there is still only limited understanding of the properties of various
energy sources and their impact on energy harvesting adaptive algorithms.
Hence, we focus on characterizing the kinetic (motion) energy that can be
harvested by a wireless node with an IoT form factor and on developing energy
allocation algorithms for such nodes. In this paper, we describe methods for
estimating harvested energy from acceleration traces. To characterize the
energy availability associated with specific human activities (e.g., relaxing,
walking, cycling), we analyze a motion dataset with over 40 participants. Based
on acceleration measurements that we collected for over 200 hours, we study
energy generation processes associated with day-long human routines. We also
briefly summarize our experiments with moving objects. We develop energy
allocation algorithms that take into account practical IoT node design
considerations, and evaluate the algorithms using the collected measurements.
Our observations provide insights into the design of motion energy harvesters,
IoT nodes, and energy harvesting adaptive algorithms.
"
235,"Algorithms for Producing Linear Dilution Gradient with Digital
  Microfluidics","  Digital microfluidic (DMF) biochips are now being extensively used to
automate several biochemical laboratory protocols such as clinical analysis,
point-of-care diagnostics, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In many
biological assays, e.g., in bacterial susceptibility tests, samples and
reagents are required in multiple concentration (or dilution) factors,
satisfying certain ""gradient"" patterns such as linear, exponential, or
parabolic. Dilution gradients are usually prepared with continuous-flow
microfluidic devices; however, they suffer from inflexibility,
non-programmability, and from large requirement of costly stock solutions. DMF
biochips, on the other hand, are shown to produce, more efficiently, a set of
random dilution factors. However, all existing algorithms fail to optimize the
cost or performance when a certain gradient pattern is required. In this work,
we present an algorithm to generate any arbitrary linear gradient, on-chip,
with minimum wastage, while satisfying a required accuracy in the concentration
factor. We present new theoretical results on the number of mix-split
operations and waste computation, and prove an upper bound on the storage
requirement. The corresponding layout design of the biochip is also proposed.
Simulation results on different linear gradients show a significant improvement
in sample cost over three earlier algorithms used for the generation of
multiple concentrations.
"
236,"Extracting the trustworthiest way to service provider in complex online
  social networks","  In complex online social networks, it is crucial for a service consumer to
extract the trustworthiest way to a target service provider from numerous
social trust paths between them. The extraction of the trustworthiest way
(namely, optimal social trust path (OSTP)) with multiple end-to-end quality of
trust (QoT) constraints has been proved to be NP-Complete. Heuristic algorithms
with polynomial and pseudo-polynomial-time complexities are often used to deal
with this challenging problem. However, existing solutions cannot guarantee the
efficiency of searching, that is, they can hardly avoid obtaining partial
optimal solutions during searching process. Quantum annealing uses
delocalization and tunneling to avoid falling into local minima without
sacrifying execution time. It has been proved to be a promising way to many
optimization problems in recently published literatures. In this paper, for the
first time, QA based OSTP algorithms (QA_OSTP) is applied to the extraction of
the trustworthiest way. The experiment results show that QA based algorithms
have better performance than its heuristic opponents.

237,"Geospatial Narratives and their Spatio-Temporal Dynamics: Commonsense
  Reasoning for High-level Analyses in Geographic Information Systems","  The modelling, analysis, and visualisation of dynamic geospatial phenomena
has been identified as a key developmental challenge for next-generation
Geographic Information Systems (GIS). In this context, the envisaged
paradigmatic extensions to contemporary foundational GIS technology raises
fundamental questions concerning the ontological, formal representational, and
(analytical) computational methods that would underlie their spatial
information theoretic underpinnings.
  We present the conceptual overview and architecture for the development of
high-level semantic and qualitative analytical capabilities for dynamic
geospatial domains. Building on formal methods in the areas of commonsense
reasoning, qualitative reasoning, spatial and temporal representation and
reasoning, reasoning about actions and change, and computational models of
narrative, we identify concrete theoretical and practical challenges that
accrue in the context of formal reasoning about `space, events, actions, and
change'. With this as a basis, and within the backdrop of an illustrated
scenario involving the spatio-temporal dynamics of urban narratives, we address
specific problems and solutions techniques chiefly involving `qualitative
abstraction', `data integration and spatial consistency', and `practical
geospatial abduction'. From a broad topical viewpoint, we propose that
next-generation dynamic GIS technology demands a transdisciplinary scientific
perspective that brings together Geography, Artificial Intelligence, and
Cognitive Science.

238,"Design of Parity Preserving Logic Based Fault Tolerant Reversible
  Arithmetic Logic Unit","  Reversible Logic is gaining significant consideration as the potential logic
design style for implementation in modern nanotechnology and quantum computing
with minimal impact on physical entropy .Fault Tolerant reversible logic is one
class of reversible logic that maintain the parity of the input and the
outputs. Significant contributions have been made in the literature towards the
design of fault tolerant reversible logic gate structures and arithmetic units,
however, there are not many efforts directed towards the design of fault
tolerant reversible ALUs. Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) is the prime performing
unit in any computing device and it has to be made fault tolerant. In this
paper we aim to design one such fault tolerant reversible ALU that is
constructed using parity preserving reversible logic gates. The designed ALU
can generate up to seven Arithmetic operations and four logical operations.
"
239,"Reconstruction of gene regulatory network of colon cancer using
  information theoretic approach","  Reconstruction of gene regulatory networks or 'reverse-engineering' is a
process of identifying gene interaction networks from experimental microarray
gene expression profile through computation techniques. In this paper, we tried
to reconstruct cancer-specific gene regulatory network using information
theoretic approach - mutual information. The considered microarray data
consists of large number of genes with 20 samples - 12 samples from colon
cancer patient and 8 from normal cell. The data has been preprocessed and
normalized. A t-test statistics has been applied to filter differentially
expressed genes. The interaction between filtered genes has been computed using
mutual information and ten different networks has been constructed with varying
number of interactions ranging from 30 to 500. We performed the topological
analysis of the reconstructed network, revealing a large number of interactions
in colon cancer. Finally, validation of the inferred results has been done with
available biological databases and literature.
"
240,"Human Brain Mapping based on COLD Signal Hemodynamic Response and
  Electrical Neuroimaging","  To understand Working of Human Brain measurements related to the brain
function are required. These measurements should be possibly non-invasive.
Brain should be disturbed as less as possible during the measurement.
Integration of various modalities plays a vital role in understanding the
cognitive and the behavioral changes in the human brain. It is an important
source of converging evidence about specific aspects of neural functions and
dysfunctions under certain pathological conditions. Focal changes in cortical
blood flow are tightly coupled with the changes in neuronal activity. This
constitutes the option to map the hemodynamic response and infer principles of
the cortical processing, even of complex tasks. The very high temporal
resolution of EEG and good spatial resolution by NIRS make this concurrent
measurement unique to study the spatio-temporal dynamics of large scale
neuronal networks in the human brain. Such integration of two techniques will
help to overcome the limitations of a specific method. Such as insensitivity of
electroencephalogram (EEG) to unsynchronized neural events or lack of near
infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to low metabolic demand. A combination of EEG and
NIRS will be more informative than the two separate analyses in both
modalities.
"
241,Memcapacitive neural networks,"  We show that memcapacitive (memory capacitive) systems can be used as
synapses in artificial neural networks. As an example of our approach, we
discuss the architecture of an integrate-and-fire neural network based on
memcapacitive synapses. Moreover, we demonstrate that the
spike-timing-dependent plasticity can be simply realized with some of these
devices. Memcapacitive synapses are a low-energy alternative to memristive
synapses for neuromorphic computation.
"
242,Resistive Threshold Logic,"  We report a resistance based threshold logic family useful for mimicking
brain like large variable logic functions in VLSI. A universal Boolean logic
cell based on an analog resistive divider and threshold logic circuit is
presented. The resistive divider is implemented using memristors and provides
output voltage as a summation of weighted product of input voltages. The output
of resistive divider is converted into a binary value by a threshold operation
implemented by CMOS inverter and/or Opamp. An universal cell structure is
presented to decrease the overall implementation complexity and number of
components. When the number of input variables become very high, the proposed
cell offers advantages of smaller area and design simplicity in comparison with
CMOS based logic circuits.
"
243,Designing Parity Preserving Reversible Circuits,"  Making a reversible circuit fault-tolerant is much more difficult than
classical circuit and there have been only a few works in the area of
parity-preserving reversible logic design. Moreover, all of these designs are
ad hoc, based on some pre-defined parity preserving reversible gates as
building blocks. In this paper, we for the first time propose a novel and
systematic approach towards parity preserving reversible circuits design. We
provide some related theoretical results and give two algorithms, one from
reversible specification to parity preserving reversible specification and
another from irreversible specification to parity preserving reversible
specification. We also evaluate the effectiveness of our approach by extensive
experimental results.
"
244,Opportunistic Spectrum Sensing and Transmissions,"  Nowadays, cognitive radio is one of the most promising paradigms in the arena
of wireless communications, as it aims at the proficient use of radio
resources. Proper utilization of the radio spectrum requires dynamic spectrum
accessing. To this end, spectrum sensing is undoubtedly necessary. In this
chapter, various approaches for dynamic spectrum access scheme are presented,
together with a survey of spectrum sensing methodologies for cognitive radio.
Moreover, the challenges are analyzed that are associated with spectrum sensing
and dynamic spectrum access techniques. Sensing beacon transmitted from
different cognitive terminals creates significant interference to the primary
users if proper precautions have not be not taken into consideration.
Consequently, cognitive radio transmitter power control will be finally
addressed to analyze energy efficiency aspects.
"
245,On quantum circuits employing roots of the Pauli matrices,"  The Pauli matrices are a set of three 2x2 complex Hermitian, unitary
matrices. In this article, we investigate the relationships between certain
roots of the Pauli matrices and how gates implementing those roots are used in
quantum circuits. Techniques for simplifying such circuits are given. In
particular, we show how those techniques can be used to find a circuit of
Clifford+T gates starting from a circuit composed of gates from the well
studied NCV library.
"
246,"Exploring Boolean and Non-Boolean Computing Applications of Spin Torque
  Devices","  In this paper we discuss the potential of emerging spintorque devices for
computing applications. Recent proposals for spinbased computing schemes may be
differentiated as all-spin vs. hybrid, programmable vs. fixed, and, Boolean vs.
non-Boolean. All spin logic-styles may offer high area-density due to small
form-factor of nano-magnetic devices. However, circuit and system-level design
techniques need to be explored that leverage the specific spin-device
characteristics to achieve energy-efficiency, performance and reliability
comparable to those of CMOS. The non-volatility of nanomagnets can be exploited
in the design of energy and area-efficient programmable logic. In such
logic-styles, spin-devices may play the dual-role of computing as well as
memory-elements that provide field-programmability. Spin-based threshold logic
design is presented as an example (dynamic resisitve threshold logic and
magnetic threshold logic). Emerging spintronic phenomena may lead to ultralow-
voltage, current-mode, spin-torque switches that can offer attractive computing
capabilities, beyond digital switches. Such devices may be suitable for
non-Boolean data-processing applications which involve analog processing.
Integration of such spin-torque devices with charge-based devices like CMOS and
resistive memory can lead to highly energy-efficient information processing
hardware for applications like pattern-matching, neuromorphic-computing,
image-processing and data-conversion. Towards the end, we discuss the
possibility of applying emerging spin-torque switches in the design of
energy-efficient global interconnects, for future chip multiprocessors.
"
247,"Ultra-low Energy, High Performance and Programmable Magnetic Threshold
  Logic","  We propose magnetic threshold-logic (MTL) design based on non-volatile
spin-torque switches. A threshold logic gate (TLG) performs summation of
multiple inputs multiplied by a fixed set of weights and compares the sum with
a threshold. MTL employs resistive states of magnetic tunnel junctions as
programmable input weights, while, a low-voltage domain-wall shift based
spin-torque switch is used for thresholding operation. The resulting MTL gate
acts as a low-power, configurable logic unit and can be used to build fully
pipelined, high-performance programmable computing blocks. Multiple stages in
such a MTL design can be connected using energy-efficient ultralow swing
programmable interconnect networks based on resistive switches. Owing to
memory-based compact logic and interconnect design and low-voltage, high-speed
spintorque based threshold operation, MTL can achieve more than two orders of
magnitude improvement in energy-delay product as compared to look-up table
based CMOS FPGA.
"
248,"Ultra-low Energy, High-Performance Dynamic Resistive Threshold Logic","  We propose dynamic resistive threshold-logic (DRTL) design based on
non-volatile resistive memory. A threshold logic gate (TLG) performs summation
of multiple inputs multiplied by a fixed set of weights and compares the sum
with a threshold. DRTL employs resistive memory elements to implement the
weights and the thresholds, while a compact dynamic CMOS latch is used for the
comparison operation. The resulting DRTL gate acts as a low-power, configurable
dynamic logic unit and can be used to build fully pipelined, high-performance
programmable computing blocks. Multiple stages in such a DRTL design can be
connected using energy-efficient low swing programmable interconnect networks
based on resistive switches. Owing to memory-based compact logic and
interconnect design and highspeed dynamic-pipelined operation, DRTL can achieve
more than two orders of magnitude improvement in energy-delay product as
compared to look-up table based CMOS FPGA.
"
249,Delay Optimal Scheduling for Energy Harvesting Based Communications,"  Green communication attracts increasing research interest recently. Equipped
with a rechargeable battery, a source node can harvest energy from ambient
environments and rely on this free and regenerative energy supply to transmit
packets. Due to the uncertainty of available energy from harvesting, however,
intolerably large latency and packet loss could be induced, if the source
always waits for harvested energy. To overcome this problem, one Reliable
Energy Source (RES) can be resorted to for a prompt delivery of backlogged
packets. Naturally, there exists a tradeoff between the packet delivery delay
and power consumption from the RES. In this paper, we address the delay optimal
scheduling problem for a bursty communication link powered by a
capacity-limited battery storing harvested energy together with one RES. The
proposed scheduling scheme gives priority to the usage of harvested energy, and
resorts to the RES when necessary based on the data and energy queueing
processes, with an average power constraint from the RES. Through
twodimensional Markov chain modeling and linear programming formulation, we
derive the optimal threshold-based scheduling policy together with the
corresponding transmission parameters. Our study includes three exemplary cases
that capture some important relations between the data packet arrival process
and energy harvesting capability. Our theoretical analysis is corroborated by
simulation results.
"
250,Artificial Immune Systems (INTROS 2),"  The biological immune system is a robust, complex, adaptive system that
defends the body from foreign pathogens. It is able to categorize all cells (or
molecules) within the body as self or non-self substances. It does this with
the help of a distributed task force that has the intelligence to take action
from a local and also a global perspective using its network of chemical
messengers for communication. There are two major branches of the immune
system. The innate immune system is an unchanging mechanism that detects and
destroys certain invading organisms, whilst the adaptive immune system responds
to previously unknown foreign cells and builds a response to them that can
remain in the body over a long period of time. This remarkable information
processing biological system has caught the attention of computer science in
recent years.
  A novel computational intelligence technique, inspired by immunology, has
emerged, called Artificial Immune Systems. Several concepts from the immune
system have been extracted and applied for solution to real world science and
engineering problems. In this tutorial, we briefly describe the immune system
metaphors that are relevant to existing Artificial Immune Systems methods. We
will then show illustrative real-world problems suitable for Artificial Immune
Systems and give a step-by-step algorithm walkthrough for one such problem. A
comparison of the Artificial Immune Systems to other well-known algorithms,
areas for future work, tips & tricks and a list of resources will round this
tutorial off. It should be noted that as Artificial Immune Systems is still a
young and evolving field, there is not yet a fixed algorithm template and hence
actual implementations might differ somewhat from time to time and from those
examples given here.

251,Securing Cognitive Radio Networks against Primary User Emulation Attacks,"  Cognitive Radio (CR) is a promising technology for next-generation wireless
networks in order to efficiently utilize the limited spectrum resources and
satisfy the rapidly increasing demand for wireless applications and services.
Security is a very important but not well addressed issue in CR networks. In
this paper we focus on security problems arising from Primary User Emulation
(PUE) attacks in CR networks. We present a comprehensive introduction to PUE
attacks, from the attacking rationale and its impact on CR networks, to
detection and defense approaches. In order to secure CR networks against PUE
attacks, a two-level database-assisted detection approach is proposed to detect
such attacks. Energy detection and location verification are combined for fast
and reliable detection. An admission control based defense approach is proposed
to mitigate the performance degradation of a CR network under a PUE attack.
Illustrative results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed detection and defense approaches.
"
252,Intrinsic universality and the computational power of self-assembly,"  This short survey of recent work in tile self-assembly discusses the use of
simulation to classify and separate the computational and expressive power of
self-assembly models. The journey begins with the result that there is a single
universal tile set that, with proper initialization and scaling, simulates any
tile assembly system. This universal tile set exhibits something stronger than
Turing universality: it captures the geometry and dynamics of any simulated
system. From there we find that there is no such tile set in the
noncooperative, or temperature 1, model, proving it weaker than the full tile
assembly model. In the two-handed or hierarchal model, where large assemblies
can bind together on one step, we encounter an infinite set, of infinite
hierarchies, each with strictly increasing simulation power. Towards the end of
our trip, we find one tile to rule them all: a single rotatable flipable
polygonal tile that can simulate any tile assembly system. It seems this could
be the beginning of a much longer journey, so directions for future work are
suggested.
"
253,On the Equivalence of Cellular Automata and the Tile Assembly Model,"  In this paper, we explore relationships between two models of systems which
are governed by only the local interactions of large collections of simple
components: cellular automata (CA) and the abstract Tile Assembly Model (aTAM).
While sharing several similarities, the models have fundamental differences,
most notably the dynamic nature of CA (in which every cell location is allowed
to change state an infinite number of times) versus the static nature of the
aTAM (in which tiles are static components that can never change or be removed
once they attach to a growing assembly). We work with 2-dimensional systems in
both models, and for our results we first define what it means for CA systems
to simulate aTAM systems, and then for aTAM systems to simulate CA systems. We
use notions of simulate which are similar to those used in the study of
intrinsic universality since they are in some sense strict, but also
intuitively natural notions of simulation. We then demonstrate a particular
nondeterministic CA which can be configured so that it can simulate any
arbitrary aTAM system, and finally an aTAM tile set which can be configured so
that it can be used to simulate any arbitrary nondeterministic CA system which
begins with a finite initial configuration.

254,"Clarification on the Mapping of Reversible Circuits to the NCV-v1
  Library","  In previous work and motivated by a theoretical discussion on physical
realizations, a new quantum gate library (the NCV-v1 library) for electronic
design automation of quantum circuits has been proposed. Here, qudits instead
of qubits are assumed, i.e. a basic building block which does not rely on a two
level quantum system but a (multiple-valued) d-level quantum system is assumed.
However, the descriptions on the foundation of this new library remained brief.
This technical report provides an extended description of the applied ideas and
concepts.
"
255,Nano-scale reservoir computing,"  This work describes preliminary steps towards nano-scale reservoir computing
using quantum dots. Our research has focused on the development of an
accumulator-based sensing system that reacts to changes in the environment, as
well as the development of a software simulation. The investigated systems
generate nonlinear responses to inputs that make them suitable for a physical
implementation of a neural network. This development will enable
miniaturisation of the neurons to the molecular level, leading to a range of
applications including monitoring of changes in materials or structures. The
system is based around the optical properties of quantum dots. The paper will
report on experimental work on systems using Cadmium Selenide (CdSe) quantum
dots and on the various methods to render the systems sensitive to pH, redox
potential or specific ion concentration. Once the quantum dot-based systems are
rendered sensitive to these triggers they can provide a distributed array that
can monitor and transmit information on changes within the material.
"
256,"Current and voltage based bit errors and their combined mitigation for
  the Kirchhoff-law-Johnson-noise secure key exchange","  We classify and analyze bit errors in the current measurement mode of the
Kirchhoff-law-Johnson-noise (KLJN) key distribution. The error probability
decays exponentially with increasing bit exchange period and fixed bandwidth,
which is similar to the error probability decay in the voltage measurement
mode. We also analyze the combination of voltage and current modes for error
removal. In this combination method, the error probability is still an
exponential function that decays with the duration of the bit exchange period,
but it has superior fidelity to the former schemes.
"
257,Spin Neurons: A Possible Path to Energy-Efficient Neuromorphic Computers,"  Recent years have witnessed growing interest in the field of brain-inspired
computing based on neural-network architectures. In order to translate the
related algorithmic models into powerful, yet energy-efficient
cognitive-computing hardware, computing-devices beyond CMOS may need to be
explored. The suitability of such devices to this field of computing would
strongly depend upon how closely their physical characteristics match with the
essential computing primitives employed in such models. In this work we discuss
the rationale of applying emerging spin-torque devices for bio-inspired
computing. Recent spin-torque experiments have shown the path to low-current,
low-voltage and high-speed magnetization switching in nano-scale magnetic
devices. Such magneto-metallic, current-mode spin-torque switches can mimic the
analog summing and thresholding operation of an artificial neuron with high
energy-efficiency. Comparison with CMOS-based analog circuit-model of neuron
shows that spin neurons can achieve more than two orders of magnitude lower
energy and beyond three orders of magnitude reduction in energy-delay product.
The application of spin neurons can therefore be an attractive option for
neuromorphic computers of future.
"
258,"Physarum wires: Self-growing self-repairing smart wires made from slime
  mould","  We report experimental laboratory studies on developing conductive pathways,
or wires, using protoplasmic tubes of plasmodium of acellular slime mould
Physarum polycephalum. Given two pins to be connected by a wire, we place a
piece of slime mould on one pin and an attractant on another pin. Physarum
propagates towards the attract and thus connects the pins with a protoplasmic
tube. A protoplasmic tube is conductive, can survive substantial over-voltage
and can be used to transfer electrical current to lightning and actuating
devices. In experiments we show how to route Physarum wires with
chemoattractants and electrical fields. We demonstrate that Physarum wire can
be grown on almost bare breadboards and on top of electronic circuits. The
Physarum wires can be insulated with a silicon oil without loss of
functionality. We show that a Physarum wire self-heals: end of a cut wire merge
together and restore the conductive pathway in several hours after being cut.
Results presented will be used in future designs of self-growing wetware
circuits and devices, and integration of slime mould electronics into
unconventional bio-hybrid systems.
"
259,On the security of the Kirchhoff-law-Johnson-noise (KLJN) communicator,"  A simple and general proof is given for the information theoretic
(unconditional) security of the Kirchhoff-law-Johnson-noise (KLJN) key exchange
system under practical conditions. The unconditional security for ideal
circumstances, which is based on the Second Law of Thermodynamics, is found to
prevail even under slightly non-ideal conditions. This security level is
guaranteed by the continuity of functions describing classical physical linear,
as well as stable non-linear, systems. Even without privacy amplification,
Eve's probability for successful bit-guessing is found to converge towards 0.5
- i.e., the perfect security level - when ideal conditions are approached.
"
260,When does a physical system compute?,"  Computing is a high-level process of a physical system. Recent interest in
non-standard computing systems, including quantum and biological computers, has
brought this physical basis of computing to the forefront. There has been,
however, no consensus on how to tell if a given physical system is acting as a
computer or not; leading to confusion over novel computational devices, and
even claims that every physical event is a computation. In this paper we
introduce a formal framework that can be used to determine whether or not a
physical system is performing a computation. We demonstrate how the abstract
computational level interacts with the physical device level, drawing the
comparison with the use of mathematical models to represent physical objects in
experimental science. This powerful formulation allows a precise description of
the similarities between experiments, computation, simulation, and technology,
leading to our central conclusion: physical computing is the use of a physical
system to predict the outcome of an abstract evolution. We give conditions that
must be satisfied in order for computation to be occurring, and illustrate
these with a range of non-standard computing scenarios. The framework also
covers broader computing contexts, where there is no obvious human computer
user. We define the critical notion of a 'computational entity', and show the
role this plays in defining when computing is taking place in physical systems.
"
261,"Table-Top Molecular Communication: Text Messages Through Chemical
  Signals","  In this work, we describe the first modular, and programmable platform
capable of transmitting a text message using chemical signalling -- a method
also known as molecular communication. This form of communication is attractive
for applications where conventional wireless systems perform poorly, from
nanotechnology to urban health monitoring. Using examples, we demonstrate the
use of our platform as a testbed for molecular communication, and illustrate
the features of these communication systems using experiments. By providing a
simple and inexpensive means of performing experiments, our system fills an
important gap in the molecular communication literature, where much current
work is done in simulation with simplified system models. A key finding in this
paper is that these systems are often nonlinear in practice, whereas current
simulations and analysis often assume that the system is linear. However, as we
show in this work, despite the nonlinearity, reliable communication is still
possible. Furthermore, this work motivates future studies on more realistic
modelling, analysis, and design of theoretical models and algorithms for these
systems.
"
262,"Quantum Computing's Classical Problem, Classical Computing's Quantum
  Problem","  Tasked with the challenge to build better and better computers, quantum
computing and classical computing face the same conundrum: the success of
classical computing systems. Small quantum computing systems have been
demonstrated, and intermediate-scale systems are on the horizon, capable of
calculating numeric results or simulating physical systems far beyond what
humans can do by hand. However, to be commercially viable, they must surpass
what our wildly successful, highly advanced classical computers can already do.
At the same time, those classical computers continue to advance, but those
advances are now constrained by thermodynamics, and will soon be limited by the
discrete nature of atomic matter and ultimately quantum effects. Technological
advances benefit both quantum and classical machinery, altering the competitive
landscape. Can we build quantum computing systems that out-compute classical
systems capable of some $10^{30}$ logic gates per month? This article will
discuss the interplay in these competing and cooperating technological trends.
"
263,Towards Gigayear Storage Using a Silicon-Nitride/Tungsten Based Medium,"  Current digital data storage systems are able to store huge amounts of data.
Even though the data density of digital information storage has increased
tremendously over the last few decades, the data longevity is limited to only a
few decades. If we want to preserve anything about the human race which can
outlast the human race itself, we require a data storage medium designed to
last for 1 million to 1 billion years. In this paper a medium is investigated
consisting of tungsten encapsulated by siliconnitride which, according to
elevated temperature tests, will last for well over the suggested time.
"
264,Asymptotically Optimal Topological Quantum Compiling,"  In a topological quantum computer, universality is achieved by braiding and
quantum information is natively protected from small local errors. We address
the problem of compiling single-qubit quantum operations into braid
representations for non-abelian quasiparticles described by the Fibonacci anyon
model. We develop a probabilistically polynomial algorithm that outputs a braid
pattern to approximate a given single-qubit unitary to a desired precision. We
also classify the single-qubit unitaries that can be implemented exactly by a
Fibonacci anyon braid pattern and present an efficient algorithm to produce
their braid patterns. Our techniques produce braid patterns that meet the
uniform asymptotic lower bound on the compiled circuit depth and thus are
depth-optimal asymptotically. Our compiled circuits are significantly shorter
than those output by prior state-of-the-art methods, resulting in improvements
in depth by factors ranging from 20 to 1000 for precisions ranging between
$10^{-10}$ and $10^{-30}$.

265,"An Improved Majority-Logic Decoder Offering Massively Parallel Decoding
  for Real-Time Control in Embedded Systems","  We propose an easy-to-implement hard-decision majority-logic decoding
algorithm for Reed-Muller codes RM(r,m) with m >= 3, m/2 >= r >= 1. The
presented algorithm outperforms the best known majority-logic decoding
algorithms and offers highly parallel decoding. The result is of special
importance for safety- and time-critical applications in embedded systems. A
simple combinational circuit can perform the proposed decoding. In particular,
we show how our decoder for the three-error-correcting code RM(2,5) of
dimension 16 and length 32 can be realized on hardware level.
"
266,Fault Tolerant Synthesis of Reversible Circuits,"  Reversible computing has emerged as a possible low cost alternative to
conventional computing in terms of speed, power consumption and computing
capability. In order to achieve reliable circuits in reversible computing,
provision for fault tolerance is necessary. A number of fault models, fault
tolerant techniques (such as parity-preserving) and testing approaches have
proposed in literature. This dissertation exploits parity-preserving
characteristics of two reversible gates which provide low cost
parity-preserving based fault tolerance. In order to extend online testability
of reversible circuits, the substitution of Peres gate has been presented. The
online testing capabilities of MCF including Swap and Fredkin gates were also
identifies. Finally a tool was developed to implement all above substitutions
and converting any reversible circuit to parity-preserving based fault tolerant
circuit.

267,Digital Circuits Implementation On Rpga Simulator,"  For Reversible computing, Target technology is yet to become available.
Adequate tools are not yet developed for reversible technology. Simulation is
still under development. Classical logic synthesis methods and simulation tools
can not be used in reversible computing. Because these work on irreversible
logic blocks but in reversible computing reversible logic blocks are used for
design and implementation. So, we need a simulation platform to analysis and
development in this area. So, we worked on this area and developed a GUI based
simulator. In the Dissertation work, we undertook simulation of RPGA,
reversible alternative to FPGA. We developed a RPGA simulator in our project.
RPGA simulator combines the technology of PLD/FPGA/SYSTOLIC array. Our RPGA
simulator, implements a given symmetric reversible Circuit on a RPGA structure.
We also worked on RPGA structure gates (picton and kerntopf gates) to develop a
better RPGA structure. Stepwise execution on RPGA structure is also performed
in RPGA simulator. We also designed new algorithms for Truth Table generation
and symmetry analysis. The dissertation work aims to develop entire simulator
is GUI based and easy to learn that makes it user friendly. User can easily
view all simulation results in GUI of our RPGA simulator.

268,"On the internalisation, intraplasmodial carriage and excretion of
  metallic nanoparticles in the slime mould Physarum polycephalum","  The plasmodium of Physarum polycephalum is a large single cell visible with
the naked eye. When inoculated on a substrate with attractants and repellents
the plasmodium develops optimal networks of protoplasmic tubes which span sites
of attractants (i.e. nutrients) yet avoid domains with a high nutrient
concentration. It should therefore be possible to program the plasmodium
towards deterministic adaptive transformation of internalised nano- and
micro-scale materials. In laboratory experiments with magnetite nanoparticles
and glass micro-spheres coated with silver metal we demonstrate that the
plasmodium of P. polycephalum can propagate the nano-scale objects using a
number of distinct mechanisms including endocytosis, transcytosis and dragging.
The results of our experiments could be used in the development of novel
techniques targeted towards the growth of metallised biological wires and
hybrid nano- and micro-circuits.
"
269,Zermelo Navigation and a Speed Limit to Quantum Information Processing,"  We use a specific geometric method to determine speed limits to the
implementation of quantum gates in controlled quantum systems that have a
specific class of constrained control functions. We achieve this by applying a
recent theorem of Shen, which provides a connection between time optimal
navigation on Riemannian manifolds and the geodesics of a certain Finsler
metric of Randers type. We use the lengths of these geodesics to derive the
optimal implementation times (under the assumption of constant control fields)
for an arbitrary quantum operation (on a finite dimensional Hilbert space), and
explicitly calculate the result for the case of a controlled single spin system
in a magnetic field, and a swap gate in a Heisenberg spin chain.
"
270,Generators and relations for n-qubit Clifford operators,"  We define a normal form for Clifford circuits, and we prove that every
Clifford operator has a unique normal form. Moreover, we present a rewrite
system by which any Clifford circuit can be reduced to normal form. This yields
a presentation of Clifford operators in terms of generators and relations.
"
271,DNACloud: A Potential Tool for storing Big Data on DNA,"  The term Big Data is usually used to describe huge amount of data that is
generated by humans from digital media such as cameras, internet, phones,
sensors etc. By building advanced analytics on the top of big data, one can
predict many things about the user such as behavior, interest etc. However
before one can use the data, one has to address many issues for big data
storage. Two main issues are the need of large storage devices and the cost
associated with it. Synthetic DNA storage seems to be an appropriate solution
to address these issues of the big data. Recently in 2013, Goldman and his
collegues from European Bioinformatics Institute demonstrated the use of the
DNA as storage medium with capacity of storing 2.2 peta bytes of information on
one gram of DNA and retrived the data successfully with low error rate. This
significant step shows a promise for synthetic DNA storage as a useful
technology for the future data storage. Motivated by this, we have developed a
software called DNACloud which makes it easy to store the data on the DNA. In
this work, we present detailed description of the software.
"
272,"Realization of Morphing Logic Gates in a Repressilator with Quorum
  Sensing Feedback","  We demonstrate how a genetic ring oscillator network with quorum sensing
feedback can operate as a robust logic gate. Specifically we show how a range
of logic functions, namely AND/NAND, OR/NOR and XOR/XNOR, can be realized by
the system, thus yielding a versatile unit that can morph between different
logic operations. We further demonstrate the capacity of this system to yield
complementary logic operations in parallel. Our results then indicate the
computing potential of this biological system, and may lead to bio-inspired
computing devices.
"
273,"Spin polarized induction of quantum correlations-entanglement using a 2
  MeV proton beam channeling","  In solid_state hybrid electron_nuclear spin systems quantum entanglement
plays vital role in allowing accessible transfer of information between
subatomic particles, regardless of the host lattice coordination spatial
geometry, revealing the powerful resource for nuclear quantum states
engineering. Here we present study of 2 MeV superfocused channeled proton (SCP)
beam induced polarization of atom_photon correlated states, established in
isotopically purified silicon nanocrystal. Two level entangling interaction
which couples an initial quantum state to two possible light_matter states via
silicon nanocrystal interface is presented. The anisotropic hyperfine coupling
is demonstrated by strong mixing of quantum states within the control mechanism
of the coherent proton pulse sequence. Obtained results reveal the mutual
predictable correlation of particles of energy_matter, by using the fully
broadcastable and precise hybrid electron_nuclear spin qubit manipulations
which can be exploited for the speed_superior communication channels keeping at
the same time the maximum degree of data preservation.
"
274,Towards Hybrid Artificial-Slime Mould Devices,"  The plasmodium of the slime mould Physarum polycephalum has recently received
significant attention for its value as a highly malleable amorphous computing
substrate. In laboratory-based experiments, micro- and nanoscale artificial
circuit components were introduced into the P. polycephalum plasmdodium to
investigate the electrical properties and computational abilities of hybridised
slime mould. It was found through a combination of imaging techniques and
electrophysiological measurements that P. polycephalum is able to internalise a
range of electrically active nanoparticles, assemble them in vivo and
distribute them around the plasmodium. Hybridised plasmodium is able to form
biomorphic mineralised networks, both inside the living plasmodium and the
empty trails left in its wake by taxis, both of which facilitate the
transmission of electricity. Hybridisation also alters the bioelectrical
activity of the plasmodium and likely influences its information processing
capabilities. It was concluded that hybridised slime mould is a suitable
substrate for producing functional unconventional computing devices.
"
275,A traffic model based on fuzzy cellular automata,"  Cellular automata (CA) play an important role in the development of
computationally efficient microscopic traffic models and recently have gained
considerable importance as a mean of optimising traffic control strategies.
However, real-time application of the available CA models in traffic control
systems is a difficult task due to their discrete and stochastic nature. This
paper introduces a novel method for simulation of signalised traffic streams,
which combines CA and fuzzy numbers. The introduced traffic simulation
algorithm eliminates main drawbacks of the CA approach, i.e. necessity of
multiple Monte Carlo simulations and calibration issues. Computational cost of
traffic simulation for the proposed algorithm is considerably lower than the
cost of simulation based on stochastic CA. Thus, the simulation results can be
obtained in a much shorter time. Experiments confirmed that the simulation
results for the introduced algorithm are consistent with that observed for
stochastic CA. The proposed simulation algorithm is suitable for real-time
applications in traffic control systems.
"
276,Channel and Noise Models for Nonlinear Molecular Communication Systems,"  Recently, a tabletop molecular communication platform has been developed for
transmitting short text messages across a room. The end-to-end system impulse
response for this platform does not follow previously published theoretical
works because of imperfect receiver, transmitter, and turbulent flows.
Moreover, it is observed that this platform resembles a nonlinear system, which
makes the rich body of theoretical work that has been developed by
communication engineers not applicable to this platform. In this work, we first
introduce corrections to the previous theoretical models of the end-to-end
system impulse response based on the observed data from experimentation. Using
the corrected impulse response models, we then formulate the nonlinearity of
the system as noise and show that through simplifying assumptions it can be
represented as Gaussian noise. Through formulating the system's nonlinearity as
the output a linear system corrupted by noise, the rich toolbox of mathematical
models of communication systems, most of which are based on linearity
assumption, can be applied to this platform.
"
277,"Toward bio-inspired information processing with networks of nano-scale
  switching elements","  Unconventional computing explores multi-scale platforms connecting
molecular-scale devices into networks for the development of scalable
neuromorphic architectures, often based on new materials and components with
new functionalities. We review some work investigating the functionalities of
locally connected networks of different types of switching elements as
computational substrates. In particular, we discuss reservoir computing with
networks of nonlinear nanoscale components. In usual neuromorphic paradigms,
the network synaptic weights are adjusted as a result of a training/learning
process. In reservoir computing, the non-linear network acts as a dynamical
system mixing and spreading the input signals over a large state space, and
only a readout layer is trained. We illustrate the most important concepts with
a few examples, featuring memristor networks with time-dependent and history
dependent resistances.
"
278,"Energy Efficient Spectrum Sensing and Handoff Strategies in Cognitive
  Radio Networks","  The limited spectrum resources and dramatic growth of high data rate
communications have motivated opportunistic spectrum access using the promising
concept of cognitive radio networks. Although this concept has emerged
primarily to enhance spectrum utilization, the importance of energy consumption
poses new challenges, because energy efficiency and communication performance
can be at odds. In this paper, the existing approaches to energy efficiency
spectrum sensing and handoff are classified. The tradeoff between energy
consumption and throughput is established as function of the numerous design
parameters of cognitive radio networks, both in the case of local and of
cooperative spectrum sensing. It is argued that a number of important aspects
still needs to be researched, such as fairness, dynamic behavior, reactive and
proactive schemes for energy efficiency.
"
279,Times in noise-based logic: increased dimensions of logic hyperspace,"  Time shifts beyond the correlation time of the logic and reference signals
create new elements that are orthogonal to the original components. This fact
can be utilized to increase the number of dimensions of the logic space while
keeping the number of reference noises fixed. Using just a single noise and
time shifts can realize exponentially large hyperspaces with large numbers of
dimensions. Other, independent applications of time shifts include holographic
noise-based logic systems and changing commutative operations into
non-commuting ones. For the sake of simplicity, these ideas are illustrated by
deterministic time shifts, even though random timing and random time shifts
would yield the most robust systems.
"
280,"Fully Automatic Liquid Metal Printer towards Personal Electronics
  Manufacture","  Printed electronics is quickly emerging with tremendous value in a wide
variety of latest electrical engineering areas. However, restricted to the
rather limited conductive inks and printing strategies, the currently existing
electronics manufacturing tools are generally complicated, expensive, time,
material, water and energy consuming, and thus mainly restricted to the
industrial use. Here from an alternative way, the present article demonstrated
for the first time an entirely automatic printing system for personal
electronics manufacturing through introducing a composite liquid metal ink
delivery and printing mechanism to overcome the large surface tension facing
the solution, and integrating it with the notebook computer controlling
algorithm. With the developed printer, any desired electronically conductive
patterns spanning from single wires to various complex structures like
integrated circuit (IC), antenna, PCB, RFID, electronic greeting cards,
decoration arts, classical buildings (White House, Great Wall etc.) or more
do-it-yourself (DIY) circuits were demonstrated to be printed out in a moment
with high precision. And the total cost for the whole system has reached
personal affordability, which is hard to offer by so far the state of the art
technologies. Some fundamental fluid dynamics mechanisms related to the
proposed tapping mode enabled reliable printing and adhesion of the liquid
metal electronics on the flexible substrate was systematically disclosed
through theoretical interpretation and experimental measurements. This clearly
beyond-the-lab technology and pervasively available liquid metal printer opens
the way for large scale home level electronics making in the coming time.
"
281,Routing of Physarum polycephalum signals using simple chemicals,"  In previous work the chemotaxis towards simple organic chemicals was
assessed. We utilise the knowledge gained from these chemotactic assays to
route Physarum polycephalum at a series of junctions. By applying chemical
inputs at a simple T-junction we were able to reproducibly control the path
taken by the plasmodium of P. Polycephalum. Where the chemoattractant farnesene
was used at one input a routed signal could be reproducibly generated i.e. P.
Polycephalum moves towards the source of chemoattractant. Where the
chemoattractant was applied at both inputs the signal was reproducibly split.
If a chemorepellent was used then the signal was reproducibly suppressed. If no
chemical input was used in the simple circuit then a random signal was
generated, whereby P. Polycephalum would move towards one output at the
junction, but the direction was randomly selected. We extended this study to a
more complex series of T-junctions to explore further the potential of routing
P. Polycephalum. Although many of the circuits were completed effectively, any
errors from the implementation of the simple T-junction were magnified. There
were also issues with cascading effects through multiple junctions. For example
signal splitting could be reproducibly initiated at the first junction but not
at subsequent junctions. This work highlights the potential for exploiting
chemotaxis to achieve complex and reliable routing of P. Polycephalum signals.
This may be useful in implementing computing algorithms, design of autonomous
robots and directed material synthesis. In additional experiments we showed
that the application of chemoattractant compounds at specific locations on a
homogeneous substrate could be used to reliably control the spatial
configuration of P. Polycephalum. This may have applications in implementing
geometric calculations and in robot navigation tasks such as mapping chemical
plumes.
"
282,"Towards slime mould colour sensor: Recognition of colours by Physarum
  polycephalum","  Acellular slime mould Physarum polycephalum is a popular now user-friendly
living substrate for designing of future and emergent sensing and computing
devices. P. polycephalum exhibits regular patterns of oscillations of its
surface electrical potential. The oscillation patterns are changed when the
slime mould is subjected to mechanical, chemical, electrical or optical
stimuli. We evaluate feasibility of slime-mould based colour sensors by
illuminating Physarum with red, green, blue and white colours and analysing
patterns of the slime mould's electrical potential oscillations. We define that
the slime mould recognises a colour if it reacts to illumination with the
colour by a unique changes in amplitude and periods of oscillatory activity. In
laboratory experiments we found that the slime mould recognises red and blue
colour. The slime mould does not differentiate between green and white colours.
The slime mould also recognises when red colour is switched off. We also map
colours to diversity of the oscillations: illumination with a white colour
increases diversity of amplitudes and periods of oscillations, other colours
studied increase diversity either of amplitude or period.
"
283,"Towards slime mould chemical sensor: Mapping chemical inputs onto
  electrical potential dynamics of Physarum Polycephalum","  We experimentally derived a unique one-to-one mapping between a range of
selected bioactive chemicals and patterns of oscillations of the slime mould's
extacellular electrical potential.
"
284,"Which Memristor Theory is Best for Relating Devices Properties to
  Memristive Function?","  There are three theoretical models which purport to relate
experimentally-measurable or fabrication-controllable device properties to the
memristor's operation: 1. Strukov et al's phenomenological model; 2. Georgiou
et al's Bernoulli rewrite of that phenomenological model; 3. Gale's
memory-conservation model. They differ in their prediction of the effect on
memristance of changing the electrode size and factors that affect the
hysteresis. Using a batch of TiO$_2$ sol-gel memristors fabricated with
different top electrode widths we test and compare these three theories. It was
found that, contrary to model 2's prediction, the `dimensionless lumped
parameter', $\beta$, did not correlate to any measure of the hysteresis.
Contrary to model 1, memristance was found to be dependent on the three spatial
dimensions of the TiO$_2$ layer, as was predicted by model 3. Model 3 was found
to fit the change in resistance value with electrode size. Simulations using
model 3 and experimentally derived values for contact resistance gave
hysteresis values that were linearly related to (and only one order of
magnitude out) from the experimentally-measured values. Memristor hysteresis
was found to be related to the ON state resistance and thus the electrode size
(as those two are related). These results offer a verification of the
memory-conservation theory of memristance and its association of the vacancy
magnetic flux with the missing magnetic flux in memristor theory. This is the
first paper to experimentally test various theories pertaining to the operation
of memristor devices.
"
285,Decomposition and Gluing for Adiabatic Quantum Optimization,"  Farhi and others have introduced the notion of solving NP problems using
adiabatic quantum com- puters. We discuss an application of this idea to the
problem of integer factorization, together with a technique we call gluing
which can be used to build adiabatic models of interesting problems. Although
adiabatic quantum computers already exist, they are likely to be too small to
directly tackle problems of interesting practical sizes for the foreseeable
future. Therefore, we discuss techniques for decomposition of large problems,
which permits us to fully exploit such hardware as may be available. Numerical
re- sults suggest that even simple decomposition techniques may yield
acceptable results with subexponential overhead, independent of the performance
of the underlying device.
"
286,"Remarks on Matsumoto and Amano's normal form for single-qubit Clifford+T
  operators","  Matsumoto and Amano (2008) showed that every single-qubit Clifford+T operator
can be uniquely written of a particular form, which we call the Matsumoto-Amano
normal form. In this mostly expository paper, we give a detailed and
streamlined presentation of Matsumoto and Amano's results, simplifying some
proofs along the way. We also point out some corollaries to Matsumoto and
Amano's work, including an intrinsic characterization of the Clifford+T
subgroup of SO(3), which also yields an efficient T-optimal exact single-qubit
synthesis algorithm. Interestingly, this also gives an alternative proof of
Kliuchnikov, Maslov, and Mosca's exact synthesis result for the Clifford+T
subgroup of U(2).
"
287,Design of Reversible Random Access Memory,"  Reversible logic has become immensely popular research area and its
applications have spread in various technologies for their low power
consumption. In this paper we proposed an efficient design of random access
memory using reversible logic. In the way of designing the reversible random
access memory we proposed a reversible decoder and a write enable reversible
master slave D flip-flop. All the reversible designs are superior in terms of
quantum cost, delay and garbage outputs compared to the designs existing in
literature.
"
288,A Novel Approach for Designing Online Testable Reversible Circuits,"  Reversible logic is gaining interest of many researchers due to its low power
dissipating characteristic. In this paper we proposed a new approach for
designing online testable reversible circuits. The resultant testable
reversible circuit can detect any single bit error whiles it is operating.
Appropriate theorems and lemmas are presented to clarify the proposed design.
The experimental results show that our design approach is superior in terms of
number of number of gates, garbage outputs and quantum cost.
"
289,"Resilience in Numerical Methods: A Position on Fault Models and
  Methodologies","  Future extreme-scale computer systems may expose silent data corruption (SDC)
to applications, in order to save energy or increase performance. However,
resilience research struggles to come up with useful abstract programming
models for reasoning about SDC. Existing work randomly flips bits in running
applications, but this only shows average-case behavior for a low-level,
artificial hardware model. Algorithm developers need to understand worst-case
behavior with the higher-level data types they actually use, in order to make
their algorithms more resilient. Also, we know so little about how SDC may
manifest in future hardware, that it seems premature to draw conclusions about
the average case. We argue instead that numerical algorithms can benefit from a
numerical unreliability fault model, where faults manifest as unbounded
perturbations to floating-point data. Algorithms can use inexpensive ""sanity""
checks that bound or exclude error in the results of computations. Given a
selective reliability programming model that requires reliability only when and
where needed, such checks can make algorithms reliable despite unbounded
faults. Sanity checks, and in general a healthy skepticism about the
correctness of subroutines, are wise even if hardware is perfectly reliable.
"
290,"Effect of ISI Mitigation on Modulation Techniques in Communication via
  Diffusion","  Communication via diffusion (CvD) is an effective and energy efficient method
for transmitting information in nanonetworks. In this work, we focus on a
diffusion-based communication system where the reception process is an
absorption via receptors. Whenever a molecule hits to the receiver it is
removed from the environment. This kind of reception process is called first
passage process and it is more complicated compared to diffusion process only.
In 3-D environments, obtaining analytical solution for hitting time
distribution for realistic cases is complicated, hence we develop an end-to-end
simulator for he diffusion-based communication system that sends consecutive
symbols.
  In CvD, each symbol is modulated and demodulated in a time slot called symbol
duration, however the long tail distribution of hitting time is the main
challenge that affects the symbol detection error. The molecules arriving in
the following slots become an interference source when detection takes place.
End-to-end simulator enables us to analyze the effect of inter symbol
interference (ISI) without making any assumptions on the ISI. We propose an ISI
cancellation technique that utilizes decision feedback for compensating the
effect of previously demodulated symbol. Three different modulation types are
considered with pulse, square, and cosine carrier waves. In case of constraints
on transmitter or receiver node it may not be possible to use pulse as a
carrier, and peak-to-average messenger molecule metric is defined for this
purpose. Results show that, the proposed ISI mitigation technique improves the
symbol detection performance and the amplitude-based modulations are improved
more than frequency-based modulations.
"
291,"Full-Duplex Transceiver System Calculations: Analysis of ADC and
  Linearity Challenges","  Despite the intensive recent research on wireless single-channel full-duplex
communications, relatively little is known about the transceiver chain
nonidealities of full-duplex devices. In this paper, the effect of nonlinear
distortion occurring in the transmitter power amplifier (PA) and the receiver
chain is analyzed, alongside with the dynamic range requirements of
analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). This is done with detailed system
calculations, which combine the properties of the individual electronics
components to jointly model the complete transceiver chain, including
self-interference cancellation. They also quantify the decrease in the dynamic
range for the signal of interest caused by self-interference at the
analog-to-digital interface. Using these system calculations, we provide
comprehensive numerical results for typical transceiver parameters. The
analytical results are also confirmed with full waveform simulations. We
observe that the nonlinear distortion produced by the transmitter PA is a
significant issue in a full-duplex transceiver and, when using cheaper and less
linear components, also the receiver chain nonlinearities become considerable.
It is also shown that, with digitally-intensive self-interference cancellation,
the quantization noise of the ADCs is another significant problem.
"
292,Towards plant wires,"  In experimental laboratory studies we evaluate a possibility of making
electrical wires from living plants. In scoping experiments we use lettuce
seedlings as a prototype model of a plant wire. We approximate an electrical
potential transfer function by applying direct current voltage to the lettuce
seedlings and recording output voltage. We analyse oscillation frequencies of
the output potential and assess noise immunity of the plant wires. Our findings
will be used in future designs of self-growing wetware circuits and devices,
and integration of plant-based electronic components into future and emergent
bio-hybrid systems.
"
293,Energy Harvesting in M2M and WSN Space,"  Energy harvesting or power harvesting or energy scavenging is a process where
energy is derived from external sources (e.g. solar power, thermal energy, wind
energy, salinity gradients, kinetic energy etc.), captured, and stored for
small, wireless autonomous devices, like those used in wearable electronics and
wireless sensor networks. This paper is focused to applications of Energy
Harvesting in Wireless Sensor Networks. This is going to help the ever growing
M2M (Machine to Machine) field where there is an exponential growth of
intelligent devices and automatic control of these is of paramount importance.

294,"Performance Analysis of Spin Transfer Torque Random Access Memory with
  cross shaped free layer using Heusler Alloys by using micromagnetic studies","  We investigated the performance of spin transfer torque random access memory
(STT-RAM) cell with cross shaped Heusler compound based free layer using
micromagnetic simulations. We designed the free layer using Cobalt based
Heusler compounds. Here in this paper, simulation results predict that
switching time from one state to other state is reduced. Also it is examined
that critical switching current density to switch the magnetization of free
layer of STT RAM cell is reduced.
"
295,"Design and Construction of a Brain-Like Computer: A New Class of
  Frequency-Fractal Computing Using Wireless Communication in a Supramolecular
  Organic, Inorganic System","  Here, we introduce a new class of computer which does not use any circuit or
logic gate. In fact, no program needs to be written: it learns by itself and
writes its own program to solve a problem. Godels incompleteness argument is
explored here to devise an engine where an astronomically large number of
IfThen arguments are allowed to grow by self assembly, based on the basic set
of arguments written in the system, thus, we explore the beyond Turing path of
computing but following a fundamentally different route adopted in the last
half a century old non Turing adventures. Our hardware is a multilayered seed
structure. If we open the largest seed, which is the final hardware, we find
several computing seed structures inside, if we take any of them and open,
there are several computing seeds inside. We design and synthesize the smallest
seed, the entire multilayered architecture grows by itself. The electromagnetic
resonance band of each seed looks similar, but the seeds of any layer shares a
common region in its resonance band with inner and upper layer, hence a chain
of resonance bands is formed (frequency fractal) connecting the smallest to the
largest seed (hence the name invincible rhythm or Ajeya Chhandam in Sanskrit).
"
296,Complexity Analysis of Reversible Logic Synthesis,"  Reversible logic circuit is a necessary construction for achieving ultra low
power dissipation as well as for prominent post-CMOS computing technologies
such as Quantum computing. Consequently automatic synthesis of a Boolean
function using elementary reversible logic gates has received significant
research attention in recent times, creating the domain of reversible logic
synthesis. In this paper, we study the complexity of reversible logic
synthesis. The problem is separately studied for bounded-ancilla and
ancilla-free optimal synthesis approaches. The computational complexity for
both cases are linked to known/presumed hard problems. Finally, experiments are
performed with a shortest-path based reversible logic synthesis approach and a
(0-1) ILP-based formulation.
"
297,Design of an Amplifier through Second Generation Current Conveyor,"  This paper describes the architecture of first and second generation current
conveyor (CCI and CCII respectively) and designing an amplifier using second
generation current conveyor. The designed amplifier through CCII+ can be used
in various analog computation circuits and is superior in performance than the
classical opamp. It provides better gain with higher accuracy.
"
298,Design and Synthesis of Ultra Low Energy Spin-Memristor Threshold Logic,"  A threshold logic gate (TLG) performs weighted sum of multiple inputs and
compares the sum with a threshold. We propose Spin-Memeristor Threshold Logic
(SMTL) gates, which employ memristive cross-bar array (MCA) to perform
current-mode summation of binary inputs, whereas, the low-voltage
fast-switching spintronic threshold devices (STD) carry out the threshold
operation in an energy efficient manner. Field programmable SMTL gate arrays
can operate at a small terminal voltage of ~50mV, resulting in ultra-low power
consumption in gates as well as programmable interconnect networks. We evaluate
the performance of SMTL using threshold logic synthesis. Results for common
benchmarks show that SMTL based programmable logic hardware can be more than
100x energy efficient than state of the art CMOS FPGA.
"
299,"Hierarchical Temporal Memory Based on Spin-Neurons and Resistive Memory
  for Energy-Efficient Brain-Inspired Computing","  Hierarchical temporal memory (HTM) tries to mimic the computing in
cerebral-neocortex. It identifies spatial and temporal patterns in the input
for making inferences. This may require large number of computationally
expensive tasks like, dot-product evaluations. Nano-devices that can provide
direct mapping for such primitives are of great interest. In this work we show
that the computing blocks for HTM can be mapped using low-voltage,
fast-switching, magneto-metallic spin-neurons combined with emerging resistive
cross-bar network (RCN). Results show possibility of more than 200x lower
energy as compared to 45nm CMOS ASIC design
"
300,"Design of a Hybrid Robot Control System using Memristor-Model and
  Ant-Inspired Based Information Transfer Protocols","  It is not always possible for a robot to process all the information from its
sensors in a timely manner and thus quick and yet valid approximations of the
robot's situation are needed. Here we design hybrid control for a robot within
this limit using algorithms inspired by ant worker placement behaviour and
based on memristor-based non-linearity.
"
301,"Does the D.C. Response of Memristors Allow Robotic Short-Term Memory and
  a Possible Route to Artificial Time Perception?","  Time perception is essential for task switching, and in the mammalian brain
appears alongside other processes. Memristors are electronic components used as
synapses and as models for neurons. The d.c. response of memristors can be
considered as a type of short-term memory. Interactions of the memristor d.c.
response within networks of memristors leads to the emergence of oscillatory
dynamics and intermittent spike trains, which are similar to neural dynamics.
Based on this data, the structure of a memristor network control for a robot as
it undergoes task switching is discussed and it is suggested that these
emergent network dynamics could improve the performance of role switching and
learning in an artificial intelligence and perhaps create artificial time
perception.
"
302,"The Short-term Memory (D.C. Response) of the Memristor Demonstrates the
  Causes of the Memristor Frequency Effect","  A memristor is often identified by showing its distinctive pinched hysteresis
curve and testing for the effect of frequency. The hysteresis size should
relate to frequency and shrink to zero as the frequency approaches infinity.
Although mathematically understood, the material causes for this are not well
known. The d.c. response of the memristor is a decaying curve with its own
timescale. We show via mathematical reasoning that this decaying curve when
transformed to a.c. leads to the frequency effect by considering a descretized
curve. We then demonstrate the validity of this approach with experimental data
from two different types of memristors.
"
303,"Connecting Spiking Neurons to a Spiking Memristor Network Changes the
  Memristor Dynamics","  Memristors have been suggested as neuromorphic computing elements. Spike-time
dependent plasticity and the Hodgkin-Huxley model of the neuron have both been
modelled effectively by memristor theory. The d.c. response of the memristor is
a current spike. Based on these three facts we suggest that memristors are
well-placed to interface directly with neurons. In this paper we show that
connecting a spiking memristor network to spiking neuronal cells causes a
change in the memristor network dynamics by: removing the memristor spikes,
which we show is due to the effects of connection to aqueous medium; causing a
change in current decay rate consistent with a change in memristor state;
presenting more-linear $I-t$ dynamics; and increasing the memristor spiking
rate, as a consequence of interaction with the spiking neurons. This
demonstrates that neurons are capable of communicating directly with
memristors, without the need for computer translation.
"
304,Is Spiking Logic the Route to Memristor-Based Computers?,"  Memristors have been suggested as a novel route to neuromorphic computing
based on the similarity between neurons (synapses and ion pumps) and
memristors. The D.C. action of the memristor is a current spike, which we think
will be fruitful for building memristor computers. In this paper, we introduce
4 different logical assignations to implement sequential logic in the memristor
and introduce the physical rules, summation, `bounce-back', directionality and
`diminishing returns', elucidated from our investigations. We then demonstrate
how memristor sequential logic works by instantiating a NOT gate, an AND gate
and a Full Adder with a single memristor. The Full Adder makes use of the
memristor's memory to add three binary values together and outputs the value,
the carry digit and even the order they were input in.
"
305,"Boolean Logic Gates From A Single Memristor Via Low-Level Sequential
  Logic","  By using the memristor's memory to both store a bit and perform an operation
with a second input bit, simple Boolean logic gates have been built with a
single memristor. The operation makes use of the interaction of current spikes
(occasionally called current transients) found in both memristors and other
devices. The sequential time-based logic methodology allows two logical input
bits to be used on a one-port by sending the bits separated in time. The
resulting logic gate is faster than one relying on memristor's state switching,
low power and requires only one memristor. We experimentally demonstrate
working OR and XOR gates made with a single flexible Titanium dioxide sol-gel
memristor.

306,"LIQUi|>: A Software Design Architecture and Domain-Specific Language for
  Quantum Computing","  Languages, compilers, and computer-aided design tools will be essential for
scalable quantum computing, which promises an exponential leap in our ability
to execute complex tasks. LIQUi|> is a modular software architecture designed
to control quantum hardware. It enables easy programming, compilation, and
simulation of quantum algorithms and circuits, and is independent of a specific
quantum architecture. LIQUi|> contains an embedded, domain-specific language
designed for programming quantum algorithms, with F# as the host language. It
also allows the extraction of a circuit data structure that can be used for
optimization, rendering, or translation. The circuit can also be exported to
external hardware and software environments. Two different simulation
environments are available to the user which allow a trade-off between number
of qubits and class of operations. LIQUi|> has been implemented on a wide range
of runtimes as back-ends with a single user front-end. We describe the
significant components of the design architecture and how to express any given
quantum algorithm.

307,The Power of Duples (in Self-Assembly): It's Not So Hip To Be Square,"  In this paper we define the Dupled abstract Tile Assembly Model (DaTAM),
which is a slight extension to the abstract Tile Assembly Model (aTAM) that
allows for not only the standard square tiles, but also ""duple"" tiles which are
rectangles pre-formed by the joining of two square tiles. We show that the
addition of duples allows for powerful behaviors of self-assembling systems at
temperature 1, meaning systems which exclude the requirement of cooperative
binding by tiles (i.e., the requirement that a tile must be able to bind to at
least 2 tiles in an existing assembly if it is to attach). Cooperative binding
is conjectured to be required in the standard aTAM for Turing universal
computation and the efficient self-assembly of shapes, but we show that in the
DaTAM these behaviors can in fact be exhibited at temperature 1. We then show
that the DaTAM doesn't provide asymptotic improvements over the aTAM in its
ability to efficiently build thin rectangles. Finally, we present a series of
results which prove that the temperature-2 aTAM and temperature-1 DaTAM have
mutually exclusive powers. That is, each is able to self-assemble shapes that
the other can't, and each has systems which cannot be simulated by the other.
Beyond being of purely theoretical interest, these results have practical
motivation as duples have already proven to be useful in laboratory
implementations of DNA-based tiles.
"
308,"Era of Big Data Processing: A New Approach via Tensor Networks and
  Tensor Decompositions","  Many problems in computational neuroscience, neuroinformatics, pattern/image
recognition, signal processing and machine learning generate massive amounts of
multidimensional data with multiple aspects and high dimensionality. Tensors
(i.e., multi-way arrays) provide often a natural and compact representation for
such massive multidimensional data via suitable low-rank approximations. Big
data analytics require novel technologies to efficiently process huge datasets
within tolerable elapsed times. Such a new emerging technology for
multidimensional big data is a multiway analysis via tensor networks (TNs) and
tensor decompositions (TDs) which represent tensors by sets of factor
(component) matrices and lower-order (core) tensors. Dynamic tensor analysis
allows us to discover meaningful hidden structures of complex data and to
perform generalizations by capturing multi-linear and multi-aspect
relationships. We will discuss some fundamental TN models, their mathematical
and graphical descriptions and associated learning algorithms for large-scale
TDs and TNs, with many potential applications including: Anomaly detection,
feature extraction, classification, cluster analysis, data fusion and
integration, pattern recognition, predictive modeling, regression, time series
analysis and multiway component analysis.

"
309,Optimal ancilla-free Clifford+T approximation of z-rotations,"  We consider the problem of approximating arbitrary single-qubit z-rotations
by ancilla-free Clifford+T circuits, up to given epsilon. We present a fast new
probabilistic algorithm for solving this problem optimally, i.e., for finding
the shortest possible circuit whatsoever for the given problem instance. The
algorithm requires a factoring oracle (such as a quantum computer). Even in the
absence of a factoring oracle, the algorithm is still near-optimal under a mild
number-theoretic hypothesis. In this case, the algorithm finds a solution of
T-count m + O(log(log(1/epsilon))), where m is the T-count of the
second-to-optimal solution. In the typical case, this yields circuit
approximations of T-count 3log_2(1/epsilon) + O(log(log(1/epsilon))). Our
algorithm is efficient in practice, and provably efficient under the
above-mentioned number-theoretic hypothesis, in the sense that its expected
runtime is O(polylog(1/epsilon)).

310,"Readout Optical System of Sapphire Disks intended for Long-Term Data
  Storage","  The development of long-term data storage technology is one of the urging
problems of our time. This paper presents the results of implementation of
technical solution for long-term data storage technology proposed a few years
ago on the basis of single crystal sapphire. It is shown that the problem of
reading data through a substrate of negative single crystal sapphire can be
solved by using for reading a special optical system with a plate of positive
single crystal quartz. The experimental results confirm the efficiency of the
proposed method of compensation.
"
311,Doubles and Negatives are Positive (in Self-Assembly),"  In the abstract Tile Assembly Model (aTAM), the phenomenon of cooperation
occurs when the attachment of a new tile to a growing assembly requires it to
bind to more than one tile already in the assembly. Often referred to as
``temperature-2'' systems, those which employ cooperation are known to be quite
powerful (i.e. they are computationally universal and can build an enormous
variety of shapes and structures). Conversely, aTAM systems which do not
enforce cooperative behavior, a.k.a. ``temperature-1'' systems, are conjectured
to be relatively very weak, likely to be unable to perform complex computations
or algorithmically direct the process of self-assembly. Nonetheless, a variety
of models based on slight modifications to the aTAM have been developed in
which temperature-1 systems are in fact capable of Turing universal computation
through a restricted notion of cooperation. Despite that power, though, several
of those models have previously been proven to be unable to perform or simulate
the stronger form of cooperation exhibited by temperature-2 aTAM systems.
  In this paper, we first prove that another model in which temperature-1
systems are computationally universal, namely the restricted glue TAM (rgTAM)
in which tiles are allowed to have edges which exhibit repulsive forces, is
also unable to simulate the strongly cooperative behavior of the temperature-2
aTAM. We then show that by combining the properties of two such models, the
Dupled Tile Assembly Model (DTAM) and the rgTAM into the DrgTAM, we derive a
model which is actually more powerful at temperature-1 than the aTAM at
temperature-2. Specifically, the DrgTAM, at temperature-1, can simulate any
aTAM system of any temperature, and it also contains systems which cannot be
simulated by any system in the aTAM.
"
312,Towards slime mould electrical logic gates with optical coupling,"  Physarum polycephalum is a macroscopic single celled plasmodial slime mould.
We employ plasmodial phototactic responses to construct laboratory prototypes
of NOT and NAND logical gates with electrical inputs/outputs and optical
coupling; the slime mould plays dual roles of computing device and electrical
conductor. Slime mould logical gates are fault tolerant and resettable. The
results presented here advance our understanding of how biological computing
substrates may be manipulated to implement logical operations and demonstrate
the feasibility of integrating living substrates into silicon hardware.
"
313,"Sensory fusion in Physarum polycephalum and implementing multi-sensory
  functional computation","  Surface electrical potential and observational growth recordings were made of
a protoplasmic tube of the slime mould Physarum polycephalum in response to a
multitude of stimuli with regards to sensory fusion or multisensory
integration. Each stimulus was tested alone and in combination in order to
evaluate for the first time the effect that multiple stimuli have on the
frequency of streaming oscillation. White light caused a decrease in frequency
whilst increasing the temperature and applying a food source in the form of oat
flakes both increased the frequency. Simultaneously stimulating P. polycephalum
with light and oat flake produced no net change in frequency, while combined
light and heat stimuli showed an increase in frequency smaller than that
observed for heat alone. When the two positive stimuli, oat flakes and heat,
were combined, there was a net increase in frequency similar to the cumulative
increases caused by the individual stimuli. Boolean logic gates were derived
from the measured frequency change.
"
314,"Applicability of Well-Established Memristive Models for Simulations of
  Resistive Switching Devices","  Highly accurate and predictive models of resistive switching devices are
needed to enable future memory and logic design. Widely used is the memristive
modeling approach considering resistive switches as dynamical systems. Here we
introduce three evaluation criteria for memristor models, checking for
plausibility of the I-V characteristics, the presence of a sufficiently
non-linearity of the switching kinetics, and the feasibility of predicting the
behavior of two anti-serially connected devices correctly. We analyzed two
classes of models: the first class comprises common linear memristor models and
the second class widely used non-linear memristive models. The linear memristor
models are based on Strukovs initial memristor model extended by different
window functions, while the non-linear models include Picketts physics-based
memristor model and models derived thereof. This study reveals lacking
predictivity of the first class of models, independent of the applied window
function. Only the physics-based model is able to fulfill most of the basic
evaluation criteria.
"
315,"Neuromorphic electronic circuits for building autonomous cognitive
  systems","  Several analog and digital brain-inspired electronic systems have been
recently proposed as dedicated solutions for fast simulations of spiking neural
networks. While these architectures are useful for exploring the computational
properties of large-scale models of the nervous system, the challenge of
building low-power compact physical artifacts that can behave intelligently in
the real-world and exhibit cognitive abilities still remains open. In this
paper we propose a set of neuromorphic engineering solutions to address this
challenge. In particular, we review neuromorphic circuits for emulating neural
and synaptic dynamics in real-time and discuss the role of biophysically
realistic temporal dynamics in hardware neural processing architectures; we
review the challenges of realizing spike-based plasticity mechanisms in real
physical systems and present examples of analog electronic circuits that
implement them; we describe the computational properties of recurrent neural
networks and show how neuromorphic Winner-Take-All circuits can implement
working-memory and decision-making mechanisms. We validate the neuromorphic
approach proposed with experimental results obtained from our own circuits and
systems, and argue how the circuits and networks presented in this work
represent a useful set of components for efficiently and elegantly implementing
neuromorphic cognition.
"
316,A Molecular Communication Link for Monitoring in Confined Environments,"  In this paper, we consider a molecular diffusion based communications link
that can reliably transport data over-the-air. We show that the system can also
reliably transport data across confined structural environments, especially in
cases where conventional electromagnetic (EM) wave based systems may fail. In
particular, this paper compares the performance of our proprietary molecular
communication test-bed with Zigbee wireless sensors in a metal pipe network
that does not act as a radio wave-guide. The paper first shows that a
molecular-based communication link's performance is determined primarily by the
delay time spread of the pulse response. The paper go on to show that
molecular-based systems can transmit more reliably in complex and confined
structural environments than conventional EM-based systems. The paper then
utilizes empirical data to find relationships between the received radio signal
strength, the molecular pulse spread, data rate (0.1 bits/s) and the structural
propagation environment.
"
317,Slime mould electronic oscillators,"  We construct electronic oscillator from acellular slime mould Physarum
polycephalum. The slime mould oscillator is made of two electrodes connected by
a protoplasmic tube of the living slime mould. A protoplasmic tube has an
average resistance of 3~MOhm. The tube's resistance is changing over time due
to peristaltic contractile activity of the tube. The resistance of the
protoplasmic tube oscillates with average period of 73~sec and average
amplitude of 0.6~MOhm. We present experimental laboratory results on dynamics
of Physarum oscillator under direct current voltage up to 15~V and speculate
that slime mould P. polycephalum can be employed as a living electrical
oscillator in biological and hybrid circuits.
"
318,Molecular Communication Systems Design for Future City,"  An area of interest in the modern age is the human migration from rural areas
to cities. Cities are characterized by a dense concentration of buildings and
key infrastructures. However, what has been lacking is a pervasive sensor
technology that can monitor the performance of these structures. Partly, this
is due to the fact that the information collected from sensors cannot be easily
transported from the embedded location to an external data hub. Examples of
health monitoring in structures include monitoring corrosion, fracture stress,
and material delamination. The scenario examples include: pipelines, tunnel
networks, and some industrial and medical areas such as hospitals (minimise
electromagnetic interference), and turbines.
"
319,"Performance of Macro-Scale Molecular Communications with Sensor Cleanse
  Time","  In this paper, we consider a molecular diffusion based communications link
that conveys information on the macro-scale (several metres). The motivation is
to apply molecular-based communications to challenging electromagnetic
environments. We first derive a novel capture probability expression of a
finite sized receiver. The paper then introduces the concept of time-aggregated
molecular noise at the receiver as a function of the rate at which the sensor
can self-cleanse. The resulting inter-symbol-interference is expressed as a
function of the sensor cleanse time, and the performance metrics of bit error
rate, throughput and round-trip-time are derived. The results show that the
performance is very sensitive to the sensor cleanse time and the drift
velocity. The paper concludes with recommendations on the design of a real
communication link based on these findings and applies the concepts to a
test-bed.
"
320,Metal-Gated Junctionless Nanowire Transistors,"  Junctionless Nanowire Field-Effect Transistors (JNFETs), where the channel
region is uniformly doped without the need for source-channel and drain-channel
junctions or lateral doping abruptness, are considered an attractive
alternative to conventional CMOS FETs. Previous theoretical and experimental
works [1][2] on JNFETs have considered polysilicon gates and silicon-dioxide
dielectric. However, with further scaling, JNFETs will suffer from deleterious
effects of doped polysilicon such as high resistance, additional capacitance
due to gate-oxide interface depletion, and incompatibility with high-k
dielectrics[3][4]. In this paper, novel metal- gated high-k JNFETs are
investigated through detailed process and device simulations. These MJNFETs are
also ideally suited for new types of nano-architectures such as N3ASICs [5]
which utilize regular nanowire arrays with limited customization. In such nano-
systems, the simplified device geometry in conjunction with a single-type FET
circuit style [6] would imply that logic arrays could be patterned out of
pre-doped SOI wafers without the need for any additional ion implantation.
"
321,Skybridge: 3-D Integrated Circuit Technology Alternative to CMOS,"  Continuous scaling of CMOS has been the major catalyst in miniaturization of
integrated circuits (ICs) and crucial for global socio-economic progress.
However, scaling to sub-20nm technologies is proving to be challenging as
MOSFETs are reaching their fundamental limits and interconnection bottleneck is
dominating IC operational power and performance. Migrating to 3-D, as a way to
advance scaling, has eluded us due to inherent customization and manufacturing
requirements in CMOS that are incompatible with 3-D organization. Partial
attempts with die-die and layer-layer stacking have their own limitations. We
propose a 3-D IC fabric technology, Skybridge[TM], which offers paradigm shift
in technology scaling as well as design. We co-architect Skybridge's core
aspects, from device to circuit style, connectivity, thermal management, and
manufacturing pathway in a 3-D fabric-centric manner, building on a uniform 3-D
template. Our extensive bottom-up simulations, accounting for detailed material
system structures, manufacturing process, device, and circuit parasitics,
carried through for several designs including a designed microprocessor, reveal
a 30-60x density, 3.5x performance per watt benefits, and 10X reduction in
interconnect lengths vs. scaled 16-nm CMOS. Fabric-level heat extraction
features are shown to successfully manage IC thermal profiles in 3-D. Skybridge
can provide continuous scaling of integrated circuits beyond CMOS in the 21st
century.
"
322,Nanowire Volatile RAM as an Alternative to SRAM,"  Maintaining benefits of CMOS technology scaling is becoming challenging due
to increased manufacturing complexities and unwanted passive power
dissipations. This is particularly challenging in SRAM, where manufacturing
precision and leakage power control are critical issues. To alleviate some of
these challenges a novel non-volatile memory alternative to SRAM was proposed
called nanowire volatile RAM (NWRAM). Due to NWRAMs regular grid based layout
and innovative circuit style, manufacturing complexity is reduced and at the
same time considerable benefits are attained in terms of performance and
leakage power reduction. In this paper, we elaborate more on NWRAM circuit
aspects and manufacturability, and quantify benefits at 16nm technology node
through simulation against state-of-the-art 6T-SRAM and gridded 8T-SRAM
designs. Our results show the 10T-NWRAM to be 2x faster and 35x better in terms
of leakage when compared to high performance gridded 8T-SRAM design.
"
323,"3D Vertical Dual-Layer Oxide Memristive Devices for Neuromorphic
  Computing","  Dual-layer resistive switching devices with horizontal W electrodes, vertical
Pd electrodes and WOx switching layer formed at the sidewall of the horizontal
electrodes have been fabricated and characterized. The devices exhibit
well-characterized analog switching characteristics and small mismatch in
electrical characteristics for devices formed at the two layers. The
three-dimensional (3D) vertical device structure allows higher storage density
and larger connectivity for neuromorphic computing applications. We show the
vertical devices exhibit potentiation and depression characteristics similar to
planar devices, and can be programmed independently with no crosstalk between
the layers.
"
324,"A fractal approach to the dark silicon problem: a comparison of 3D
  computer architectures -- standard slices versus fractal Menger sponge
  geometry","  The dark silicon problem, which limits the power-growth of future computer
generations, is interpreted as a heat energy transport problem when increasing
the energy emitting surface area within a given volume. A comparison of two
3D-configuration models, namely a standard slicing and a fractal surface
generation within the Menger sponge geometry is presented. It is shown, that
for iteration orders $n>3$ the fractal model shows increasingly better thermal
behavior. As a consequence cooling problems may be minimized by using a fractal
architecture. Therefore the Menger sponge geometry is a good example for
fractal architectures applicable not only in computer science, but also e.g. in
chemistry when building chemical reactors, optimizing catalytic processes or in
sensor construction technology building highly effective sensors for toxic
gases or water analysis.
"
325,Transmit Pulse Shaping for Molecular Communications,"  This paper presents a method for shaping the transmit pulse of a molecular
signal such that the diffusion channel's response is a sharp pulse. The impulse
response of a diffusion channel is typically characterised as having an
infinitely long transient response. This can cause severe
inter-symbol-interference, and reduce the achievable reliable bit rate. We
achieve the desired chemical channel response by poisoning the channel with a
secondary compound, such that it chemically cancels aspects of the primary
information signal. We use two independent methods to show that the chemical
concentration of the \emph{information signal} should be $\propto \delta(t)$
and that of the \emph{poison signal} should be $\propto t^{-3/2}$.
"
326,Low-distance Surface Codes under Realistic Quantum Noise,"  We study the performance of distance-three surface code layouts under
realistic multi-parameter noise models. We first calculate their thresholds
under depolarizing noise. We then compare a Pauli-twirl approximation of
amplitude and phase damping to amplitude and phase damping. We find the
approximate channel results in a pessimistic estimate of the logical error
rate, indicating the realistic threshold may be higher than previously
estimated. From Monte-Carlo simulations, we identify experimental parameters
for which these layouts admit reliable computation. Due to its low resource
cost and superior performance, we conclude that the 17-qubit layout should be
targeted in early experimental implementations of the surface code. We find
that architectures with gate times in the 5-40 ns range and T1 times of at
least 1-2 us range will exhibit improved logical error rates with a 17-qubit
surface code encoding.
"
327,Efficient synthesis of universal Repeat-Until-Success circuits,"  Recently, it was shown that Repeat-Until-Success (RUS) circuits can achieve a
$2.5$ times reduction in expected $T$-count over ancilla-free techniques for
single-qubit unitary decomposition. However, the previously best known
algorithm to synthesize RUS circuits requires exponential classical runtime. In
this paper we present an algorithm to synthesize an RUS circuit to approximate
any given single-qubit unitary within precision $\varepsilon$ in
probabilistically polynomial classical runtime. Our synthesis approach uses the
Clifford+$T$ basis, plus one ancilla qubit and measurement. We provide
numerical evidence that our RUS circuits have an expected $T$-count on average
$2.5$ times lower than the theoretical lower bound of $3 \log_2
(1/\varepsilon)$ for ancilla-free single-qubit circuit decomposition.
"
328,Uniform and Piece-wise Uniform Fields in Memristor Models,"  The Strukov model was the phenomenological model that accompanied the
announcement of the first recognised physical instantiation of the memristor
and, as such, it has been widely used. This model described the motion of a
boundary, $w$, between two types of inter-converting material,
$R_{\mathrm{off}}$ and $R_{\mathrm{on}}$, seemingly under a uniform field
across the entire device. In fact, what was intended was a field with a
discontinuity at $w$, that was uniform between $0<x<w$. In this paper we show
that the discontinuity is required for the Strukov model derivation to be
completed, and thus the derivation as given does not describe a situation with
a uniform field across the entire device. The discontinuity can be described as
a Heaviside function, $H$, located on $w$, for which there are three common
single-valued approximations for $H(w)$. The Strukov model as intended includes
an approximation for the Heaviside function (the field is taken to be the same
as that across the $R_{\mathrm{on}}$ part of the device). We compare
approximations and give solutions. We then extend the description of the field
to a more-realistic continuously varying sigmoidal transition between two
uniform fields and demonstrate that the centro-symmetric approximation model
(taking the field as being the average of the fields across $R_{\mathrm{on}}$
and $R_{\mathrm{off}}$) is a better single-point model of that situation: the
other two approximations over or underestimate the field.
"
329,A Compressive Multi-Mode Superresolution Display,"  Compressive displays are an emerging technology exploring the co-design of
new optical device configurations and compressive computation. Previously,
research has shown how to improve the dynamic range of displays and facilitate
high-quality light field or glasses-free 3D image synthesis. In this paper, we
introduce a new multi-mode compressive display architecture that supports
switching between 3D and high dynamic range (HDR) modes as well as a new
super-resolution mode. The proposed hardware consists of readily-available
components and is driven by a novel splitting algorithm that computes the pixel
states from a target high-resolution image. In effect, the display pixels
present a compressed representation of the target image that is perceived as a
single, high resolution image.
"
330,Reflections on Tiles (in Self-Assembly),"  We define the Reflexive Tile Assembly Model (RTAM), which is obtained from
the abstract Tile Assembly Model (aTAM) by allowing tiles to reflect across
their horizontal and/or vertical axes. We show that the class of directed
temperature-1 RTAM systems is not computationally universal, which is
conjectured but unproven for the aTAM, and like the aTAM, the RTAM is
computationally universal at temperature 2. We then show that at temperature 1,
when starting from a single tile seed, the RTAM is capable of assembling n x n
squares for n odd using only n tile types, but incapable of assembling n x n
squares for n even. Moreover, we show that n is a lower bound on the number of
tile types needed to assemble n x n squares for n odd in the temperature-1
RTAM. The conjectured lower bound for temperature-1 aTAM systems is 2n-1.
Finally, we give preliminary results toward the classification of which finite
connected shapes in Z^2 can be assembled (strictly or weakly) by a singly
seeded (i.e. seed of size 1) RTAM system, including a complete classification
of which finite connected shapes be strictly assembled by a ""mismatch-free""
singly seeded RTAM system.
"
331,"Size-Separable Tile Self-Assembly: A Tight Bound for Temperature-1
  Mismatch-Free Systems","  We introduce a new property of tile self-assembly systems that we call
size-separability. A system is size-separable if every terminal assembly is a
constant factor larger than any intermediate assembly. Size-separability is
motivated by the practical problem of filtering completed assemblies from a
variety of incomplete ""garbage"" assemblies using gel electrophoresis or other
mass-based filtering techniques.
  Here we prove that any system without cooperative bonding assembling a unique
mismatch-free terminal assembly can be used to construct a size-separable
system uniquely assembling the same shape. The proof achieves optimal scale
factor and temperature for the size-separable system. As part of the proof, we
obtain two results of independent interest on mismatch-free temperature-1
two-handed systems.
"
332,"Reservoir Computing Approach to Robust Computation using Unreliable
  Nanoscale Networks","  As we approach the physical limits of CMOS technology, advances in materials
science and nanotechnology are making available a variety of unconventional
computing substrates that can potentially replace top-down-designed
silicon-based computing devices. Inherent stochasticity in the fabrication
process and nanometer scale of these substrates inevitably lead to design
variations, defects, faults, and noise in the resulting devices. A key
challenge is how to harness such devices to perform robust computation. We
propose reservoir computing as a solution. In reservoir computing, computation
takes place by translating the dynamics of an excited medium, called a
reservoir, into a desired output. This approach eliminates the need for
external control and redundancy, and the programming is done using a
closed-form regression problem on the output, which also allows concurrent
programming using a single device. Using a theoretical model, we show that both
regular and irregular reservoirs are intrinsically robust to structural noise
as they perform computation.
"
333,Parallel computation using active self-assembly,"  We study the computational complexity of the recently proposed nubot model of
molecular-scale self-assembly. The model generalises asynchronous cellular
automata to have non-local movement where large assemblies of molecules can be
pushed and pulled around, analogous to millions of molecular motors in animal
muscle effecting the rapid movement of macroscale arms and legs. We show that
the nubot model is capable of simulating Boolean circuits of polylogarithmic
depth and polynomial size, in only polylogarithmic expected time. In
computational complexity terms, we show that any problem from the complexity
class NC is solvable in polylogarithmic expected time and polynomial workspace
using nubots.
  Along the way, we give fast parallel nubot algorithms for a number of
problems including line growth, sorting, Boolean matrix multiplication and
space-bounded Turing machine simulation, all using a constant number of nubot
states (monomer types). Circuit depth is a well-studied notion of parallel
time, and our result implies that the nubot model is a highly parallel model of
computation in a formal sense. Asynchronous cellular automata are not capable
of this parallelism, and our result shows that adding a rigid-body movement
primitive to such a model, to get the nubot model, drastically increases
parallel processing abilities.
"
334,Universal Memcomputing Machines,"  We introduce the notion of universal memcomputing machines (UMMs): a class of
brain-inspired general-purpose computing machines based on systems with memory,
whereby processing and storing of information occur on the same physical
location. We analytically prove that the memory properties of UMMs endow them
with universal computing power - they are Turing-complete -, intrinsic
parallelism, functional polymorphism, and information overhead, namely their
collective states can support exponential data compression directly in memory.
We also demonstrate that a UMM has the same computational power as a
non-deterministic Turing machine, namely it can solve NP--complete problems in
polynomial time. However, by virtue of its information overhead, a UMM needs
only an amount of memory cells (memprocessors) that grows polynomially with the
problem size. As an example we provide the polynomial-time solution of the
subset-sum problem and a simple hardware implementation of the same. Even
though these results do not prove the statement NP=P within the Turing
paradigm, the practical realization of these UMMs would represent a paradigm
shift from present von Neumann architectures bringing us closer to brain-like
neural computation.
"
335,"Analysis of S Band Substrate Integrated Waveguide Power Divider,
  Circulator and Coupler","  The Substrate Integrated Waveguide (SIW) technology is a very promising
technique with which we can take the advantages of both waveguides and planar
transmission lines. Therefore, in [2.1-3] GHz band various microwave components
and devices have been designed successfully using Ansoft HFSS software. We then
proceeded to the realization of the coupler and then made measurements of the
frequency response in the range [2.1-3] GHz using a network analyzer. Thus,
results of this modeling are presented, discussed and allow to integrate these
devices in planar circuits.
"
336,"On the ""cracking"" scheme in the paper ""A directional coupler attack
  against the Kish key distribution system"" by Gunn, Allison and Abbott","  Recently, Gunn, Allison and Abbott (GAA)
[http://arxiv.org/pdf/1402.2709v2.pdf] proposed a new scheme to utilize
electromagnetic waves for eavesdropping on the Kirchhoff-law-Johnson-noise
(KLJN) secure key distribution. We proved in a former paper [Fluct. Noise Lett.
13 (2014) 1450016] that GAA's mathematical model is unphysical. Here we analyze
GAA's cracking scheme and show that, in the case of a loss-free cable, it
provides less eavesdropping information than in the earlier
(Bergou)-Scheuer-Yariv mean-square-based attack [Kish LB, Scheuer J, Phys.
Lett. A 374 (2010) 2140-2142], while it offers no information in the case of a
lossy cable. We also investigate GAA's claim to be experimentally capable of
distinguishing - using statistics over a few correlation times only - the
distributions of two Gaussian noises with a relative variance difference of
less than 10^-8. Normally such distinctions would require hundreds of millions
of correlations times to be observable. We identify several potential
experimental artifacts as results of poor KLJN design, which can lead to GAA's
assertions: deterministic currents due to spurious harmonic components caused
by ground loops, DC offset, aliasing, non-Gaussian features including
non-linearities and other non-idealities in generators, and the time-derivative
nature of GAA's scheme which tends to enhance all of these artifacts.

337,"Introduction to RIMEP2: A Multi-Expression Programming System for the
  Design of Reversible Digital Circuits","  Quantum computers are considered as a future alternative to circumvent the
heat dissipation problem of VLSI circuits. The synthesis of reversible circuits
is a very promising area of study considering the expected further
technological advances towards quantum computing. In this report, we propose a
linear genetic programming system to design reversible circuits -RIMEP2-. The
system has evolved reversible circuits starting from scratch without resorting
to a pre-existing library. The results show that among the 26 considered
benchmarks, RIMEP2 outperformed the best published solutions for 20 of them and
matched the remaining 6. RIMEP2 is presented in this report as a promising
method with a considerable potential for reversible circuit design. It will be
considered as work reference for future studies based on this method.

338,3DNA: A Tool for DNA Sculpting,"  DNA self-assembly is a robust and programmable approach for building
structures at nanoscale. Researchers around the world have proposed and
implemented different techniques to build two dimensional and three dimensional
nano structures. One such technique involves the implementation of DNA Bricks
proposed by Ke et al., 2012 to create complex three-dimensional (3D)
structures. Modeling these DNA nano structures can prove to be a cumbersome and
tedious task. Exploiting the programmability of base-pairing to produce
self-assembling custom shapes, we present a software suite 3DNA, which can be
used for modeling, editing and visualizing such complex structures. 3DNA is an
open source software which works on the simple and modular self assembly of DNA
Bricks, offering a more intuitive better approach for constructing 3D shapes.
Apart from modeling and envisaging shapes through a simple graphical user
interface, 3DNA also supports an integrated random sequence generator that
generates DNA sequences corresponding to the designed model. The software is
available at www.guptalab.org/3dna

339,"Ancilla-Quantum Cost Trade-off during Reversible Logic Synthesis using
  Exclusive Sum-of-Products","  Emerging technologies with asymptotic zero power dissipation, such as quantum
computing, require the logical operations to be done in a reversible manner. In
recent years, the problem of synthesizing Boolean functions in the reversible
logic domain has gained significant research attention. The efficiency of the
synthesis methods is measured in terms of quantum cost, gate cost, garbage
lines, logic depth and speed of synthesis. In this paper, we present an
approach based on Exclusive sum-of-Products (ESOP), which allows the user to
explore the trade-off between quantum cost and garbage lines. The proposed
technique adds a new dimension to the reversible logic synthesis solutions. We
demonstrate by detailed experiments that controlled improvement in quantum cost
and gate count by increasing garbage count can be achieved. In some cases,
improved quantum cost and gate count compared to state-of-the-art synthesis
methods are reported. Furthermore, we propose a novel rule-based approach to
achieve ancilla-free reversible logic synthesis starting from an ESOP
formulation.
"
340,"Decomposition of Diagonal Hermitian Quantum Gates Using
  Multiple-Controlled Pauli Z Gates","  Quantum logic decomposition refers to decomposing a given quantum gate to a
set of physically implementable gates. An approach has been presented to
decompose arbitrary diagonal quantum gates to a set of multiplexed-rotation
gates around z axis. In this paper, a special class of diagonal quantum gates,
namely diagonal Hermitian quantum gates, is considered and a new perspective to
the decomposition problem with respect to decomposing these gates is presented.
It is first shown that these gates can be decomposed to a set that solely
consists of multiple-controlled Z gates. Then a binary representation for the
diagonal Hermitian gates is introduced. It is shown that the binary
representations of multiple-controlled Z gates form a basis for the vector
space that is produced by the binary representations of all diagonal Hermitian
quantum gates. Moreover, the problem of decomposing a given diagonal Hermitian
gate is mapped to the problem of writing its binary representation in the
specific basis mentioned above. Moreover, CZ gate is suggested to be the
two-qubit gate in the decomposition library, instead of previously used CNOT
gate. Experimental results show that the proposed approach can lead to circuits
with lower costs in comparison with the previous ones.
"
341,"Fundamental Tensor Operations for Large-Scale Data Analysis in Tensor
  Train Formats","  We discuss extended definitions of linear and multilinear operations such as
Kronecker, Hadamard, and contracted products, and establish links between them
for tensor calculus. Then we introduce effective low-rank tensor approximation
techniques including Candecomp/Parafac (CP), Tucker, and tensor train (TT)
decompositions with a number of mathematical and graphical representations. We
also provide a brief review of mathematical properties of the TT decomposition
as a low-rank approximation technique. With the aim of breaking the
curse-of-dimensionality in large-scale numerical analysis, we describe basic
operations on large-scale vectors, matrices, and high-order tensors represented
by TT decomposition. The proposed representations can be used for describing
numerical methods based on TT decomposition for solving large-scale
optimization problems such as systems of linear equations and symmetric
eigenvalue problems.
"
342,"Slime Mould Logic Gates Based on Frequency Changes of Electrical
  Potential Oscillation","  Physarum polycephalum is a large single amoeba cell, which in its plasmodial
phase,forages and connects nearby food sources with protoplasmic tubes. The
organism forages for food by growing these tubes towards detected food stuffs,
this foraging behaviour is governed by simple rules of photoavoidance and
chemotaxis. The electrical activity of the tubes oscillates, creating a
peristaltic like action within the tubes, forcing cytoplasm along the lumen;
the frequency of this oscillation controls the speed and direction of growth.
External stimuli such as light and food cause changes in the oscillation
frequency. We demonstrate that using these stimuli as logical inputs we can
approximate logic gates using these tubes and derive combinational logic
circuits by cascading the gates, with software analysis providing the output of
each gate and determining the input of the following gate. Basic gates OR, AND
and NOT were correct 90%, 77.8% and 91.7% of the time respectively. Derived
logic circuits XOR, Half Adder and Full Adder were 70.8%, 65% and 58.8%
accurate respectively. Accuracy of the combinational logic decreases as the
number of gates is increased, however they are at least as accurate as previous
logic approximations using spatial growth of Physarum polycephalum and up to 30
times as fast at computing the logical output. The results shown here
demonstrate a significant advancement in organism-based computing, providing a
solid basis for hybrid computers of the future.

343,Designing Complex Dynamics in Cellular Automata with Memory,"  Since their inception at {\it Macy conferences} in later 1940s complex
systems remain the most controversial topic of inter-disciplinary sciences. The
term `complex system' is the most vague and liberally used scientific term.
Using elementary cellular automata (ECA), and exploiting the CA classification,
we demonstrate elusiveness of `complexity' by shifting space-time dynamics of
the automata from simple to complex by enriching cells with {\it memory}. This
way, we can transform any ECA class to another ECA class --- without changing
skeleton of cell-state transition function --- and vice versa by just selecting
a right kind of memory. A systematic analysis display that memory helps
`discover' hidden information and behaviour on trivial --- uniform, periodic,
and non-trivial --- chaotic, complex --- dynamical systems.

344,"Out Performance Of Cuckoo Search Algorithm Among Nature Inspired
  Algorithms in Planar Antenna Arrays","  In this modern era a great deal of metamorphism is observed around us which
eventuate due to some minute modifications and innovations in the area of
Science and Technology. This paper deals with the application of a meta
heuristic optimization algorithm namely the Cuckoo Search Algorithm in the
design of an optimized planar antenna array which ensures high
gain,directivity, suppression of side lobes, increased efficiency and improves
other antenna parameters as well.
"
345,Analog input layer for optical reservoir computers,"  Reservoir computing is an information processing technique, derived from the
theory of neural networks, which is easy to implement in hardware. Several
reservoir computer hardware implementations have been realized recently with
performance comparable to digital implementations, which demonstrated the
potential of reservoir computing for ultrahigh bandwidth signal processing
tasks. In all these implementations however the signal pre-processing necessary
to efficiently address the reservoir was performed digitally. Here we show how
this digital pre-processing can be replaced by an analog input layer. We study
both numerically and experimentally to what extent the pre-processing can be
replaced by a modulation of the input signal by either a single sine-wave or by
a sum of two sine functions, since harmonic oscillations are particularly easy
to generate in hardware. We find that the modulation by a single sine gives
performance worse than state of the art. On the other hand, on many -but not
all- tasks, the modulation by two sines gives performances comparable to the
state of the art. The present work thus represents an important step towards
fully autonomous, ultrahigh bandwidth analog reservoir computers.
"
346,"A Model for Variation- and Fault-Tolerant Digital Logic using
  Self-Assembled Nanowire Architectures","  Reconfiguration has been used for both defect- and fault-tolerant nanoscale
architectures with regular structure. Recent advances in self-assembled
nanowires have opened doors to a new class of electronic devices with irregular
structure. For such devices, reservoir computing has been shown to be a viable
approach to implement computation. This approach exploits the dynamical
properties of a system rather than specifics of its structure. Here, we extend
a model of reservoir computing, called the echo state network, to reflect more
realistic aspects of self-assembled nanowire networks. As a proof of concept,
we use echo state networks to implement basic building blocks of digital
computing: AND, OR, and XOR gates, and 2-bit adder and multiplier circuits. We
show that the system can operate perfectly in the presence of variations five
orders of magnitude higher than ITRS's 2005 target, $\bm{6\%}$, and achieves
success rates $\bm{6}$ times higher than related approaches at half the cost.
We also describe an adaptive algorithm that can detect faults in the system and
reconfigure it to resume perfect operational condition.
"
347,"Channel Modeling of Human Somatosensory Nanonetwork: Body Discriminative
  Touch and Proprioception Perspective","  Nanonetwork design and analysis has become a very interesting topic in recent
years. Though this area of research is in its formative stage, it definitely
posses a strong integrity in finding out numerous applications in medical and
allied sciences. Nanonetworking is indeed a nature built foundation which
comprises human intra body communications. Somatosensory system is the one of
the critical and must have systems of human body. This literature concentrates
on the body discriminative touch and proprioception mechanism of somatosensory
system. This particular system is well architecture by medial lemniscal
pathway, in human body for transduction of touch and proprioceptive
information. This paper seeks out the novel communication channel model of
somatosensory system. The working principle of the channel model is established
by an equivalent Moore machine. A novel algorithm MLP is proposed after its
name, medial lemniscal pathway. A novel naomachine and appropriate processing
unit are also devised, based on the automaton.
"
348,"Degenerate Resistive Switching and Ultrahigh Density Storage in
  Resistive Memory","  We show that, in tantalum oxide resistive memories, activation power provides
a multi-level variable for information storage that can be set and read
separately from the resistance. These two state variables (resistance and
activation power) can be precisely controlled in two steps: (1) the possible
activation power states are selected by partially reducing resistance, then (2)
a subsequent partial increase in resistance specifies the resistance state and
the final activation power state. We show that these states can be precisely
written and read electrically, making this approach potentially amenable for
ultra-high density memories. We provide a theoretical explanation for
information storage and retrieval from activation power and experimentally
demonstrate information storage in a third dimension related to the change in
activation power with resistance.
"
349,TCP-like molecular communications,"  In this paper, we present a communication protocol between a pair of
biological nanomachines, transmitter and receiver, built upon molecular
communications in an aqueous environment. In our proposal, the receiver, acting
as a control node, sends a connection setup signal to the transmitter, which
stokes molecules, to start molecule transmission. The molecules transmitted by
the transmitter propagate in the environment and are absorbed by the receiver
through its receptors. When the receiver absorbs the desired quantity of
molecules, it releases a tear-down signal to notify the transmitter to stop the
transmission. The proposed protocol implements a bidirectional communication by
using a number of techniques originally designed for the TCP. In fact, the
proposed protocol is connection-oriented, and uses the TCP-like probing to find
a suitable transmission rate between transmitter and receiver so as to avoid
receiver congestion. Unlike the TCP, however, explicit acknowledgments are not
used, since they would degrade the communication throughput due to the large
delay, a characteristic feature of molecular communications. Thus, the proposed
protocol uses implicit acknowledgments, and feedback signals are sent by the
receiver to throttle the transmission rate at the transmitter, i.e., explicit
negative feedbacks. We also present the results of an extensive simulation
campaign, used to validate the proposed protocol and to properly dimension the
main protocol parameters.
"
350,"Elimination of a Second-Law-attack, and all cable-resistance-based
  attacks, in the Kirchhoff-law-Johnson-noise (KLJN) secure key exchange system","  We introduce the so far most efficient attack against the
Kirchhoff-law-Johnson-noise (KLJN) secure key exchange system. This attack
utilizes the lack of exact thermal equilibrium in practical applications and is
based on cable resistance losses and the fact that the Second Law of
Thermodynamics cannot provide full security when such losses are present. The
new attack does not challenge the unconditional security of the KLJN scheme,
but it puts more stringent demands on the security/privacy enhancing protocol
than for any earlier attack. In this paper we present a simple defense protocol
to fully eliminate this new attack by increasing the noise-temperature at the
side of the smaller resistance value over the noise-temperature at the at the
side with the greater resistance. It is shown that this simple protocol totally
removes Eve's information not only for the new attack but also for the old
Bergou-Scheuer-Yariv attack. The presently most efficient attacks against the
KLJN scheme are thereby completely nullified.
"
351,A Cost Minimization Approach to Synthesis of Linear Reversible Circuits,"  This paper presents a heuristic cost minimization approach to synthesizing
linear reversible circuits. Two bidirectional linear reversible circuit
synthesis methods are introduced, the Alternating Elimination with Cost
Minimization method (AECM) and the Multiple CNOT Gate method (MCG). Algorithms,
example syntheses, and extensions to these methods are presented. An MCG
variant which incorporates line reordering is introduced. Tests comparing the
new cost minimization methods with the best known method for large circuits are
presented. Results show that of the three methods MCG had the lowest average
CNOT gate counts for linear reversible circuits up to 24 lines, and that AECM
had the lowest counts between 28 and 60 lines.
"
352,Development of Tool for Mapping Conventional Circuit to Reversible Logic,"  In the last decades, great achievements have been made in the development of
computing machines. However, due to exponential growth of transistor density
and in particular due to tremendously increasing power consumption, researchers
expect that ""Conventional Technologies"" like Complementary Metal-Oxide
Semiconductor will reach their limits in near future. To further satisfy the
needs for more computational power, speed, less size etc. alternatives are
needed. Reversible Computation is the emerging field and alternative of
conventional technologies. Reversible Computation is emerging as a promising
solution and likely to work on extremely low power technologies and offer high
speed computations. The reversibility retains the capability to retrieve the
input data from output and minimizes heat dissipation. As migration to new
technology leave a lot of work done in current technology will make the
acceptability difficult. One side familiarly with new technology and other side
transformation of old circuit designs to new technology will pose a challenge
to designers. A need for convertibility of irreversible circuit to reversible
circuit was felt that can make a quick start and keep the development on track.
In this dissertation a logic circuit design entry based on binary logic system
has been taken up that can provide the ease of circuit design in binary logic
system and output as reversible circuit. Entire environment is GUI based and
easy to learn user friendly. This tool offers editing, storage and conversion
into reversible facility.
"
353,"Compressed EEG Acquisition with Limited Channels using Estimated Signal
  Correlation","  Nearby scalp channels in multi-channel EEG data exhibit high correlation. A
question that naturally arises is whether it is required to record signals from
all the electrodes in a group of closely spaced electrodes in a typical
measurement setup. One could save on the number of channels that are recorded,
if it were possible to reconstruct the omitted channels to the accuracy needed
for identifying the relevant information (say, spectral content in the signal),
required to carry out a preliminary diagnosis. We address this problem from a
compressed sensing perspective and propose a measurement and reconstruction
scheme. Working with publicly available EEG database, we put our scheme to
experiment and illustrate that if it is only a matter of estimating the
frequency content of the signal in various EEG bands, then all the channels
need not be recorded. We have achieved an average error below 15% between the
original and reconstructed signals with respect to estimation of the spectral
content in the delta, theta and alpha bands. We have demonstrated that channels
in the 10-10 system of electrode placement can be estimated, with an error less
than 10% using recordings on the sparser 10-20 system.
"
354,"A Compact Model of Silicon-Based Nanowire Field Effect Transistor for
  Circuit Simulation and Design","  As the conventional silicon metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor
(MOSFET) approaches its scaling limits; many novel device structures are being
extensively explored. Among them, the silicon nanowire transistor (SNWT) has
attracted broad attention. To understand device physics in depth and to assess
the performance limits of SNWTs, simulation is becoming increasingly important.
The objectives of this work are: 1) to theoretically explore the essential
physics of SNWTs (e.g., electrostatics, transport and band structure) by
performing computer-based simulations, and 2) to assess the performance limits
and scaling potentials of SNWTs and to address the SNWT design issues. The
computer based simulations carried out are essentially based on DFT using NEGF
formalism. A silicon nanowire has been modeled as PN diode (Zener Diode), PIN
diode, PIP & NIN diode configurations by selectively doping the nanowire and
simulated by biasing one end of the nanowire to ground and sweeping the other
end of the nanowire from -1 V to 1 V to obtain the electrical characteristics
of the respective diodes. In order to determine the effectiveness of the
modeled diodes in silicon nanowire, the same diodes have been modeled using a
germanium nanowire by selective doping and simulated in the same manner to
obtain the electrical characteristics of the germanium nanowire based diodes
which has been used as a reference to analyze the characteristics obtained
using silicon nanowire. The modeled diodes are extremely small in dimension
when compared to the conventional bulk silicon and germanium based diodes. This
work is followed by modeling and simulation of a gate all around nanowire field
effect transistor using two different gate dielectrics, followed by temperature
dependence of the nanowire FET characteristics and the off state current and
conductance variation using the two dielectrics.
"
355,"Photonic spike processing: ultrafast laser neurons and an integrated
  photonic network","  The marriage of two vibrant fields---photonics and neuromorphic
processing---is fundamentally enabled by the strong analogies within the
underlying physics between the dynamics of biological neurons and lasers, both
of which can be understood within the framework of nonlinear dynamical systems
theory. Whereas neuromorphic engineering exploits the biophysics of neuronal
computation algorithms to provide a wide range of computing and signal
processing applications, photonics offer an alternative approach to
neuromorphic systems by exploiting the high speed, high bandwidth, and low
crosstalk available to photonic interconnects which potentially grants the
capacity for complex, ultrafast categorization and decision-making. Here we
highlight some recent progress on this exciting field.
"
356,A framework for reversible circuit complexity,"  Reversible single-target gates are a generalization of Toffoli gates which
are a helpful formal representation for the description of synthesis algorithms
but are too general for an actual implementation based on some technology.
There is an exponential lower bound on the number of Toffoli gates required to
implement any reversible function, however, there is also a linear upper bound
on the number of single-target gates which can be proven using a constructive
proof based on a former presented synthesis algorithm. Since single-target
gates can be mapped to a cascade of Toffoli gates, this synthesis algorithm
provides an interesting framework for reversible circuit complexity. The paper
motivates this framework and illustrates first possible applications based on
it.
"
357,Optical modular arithmetic,"  Nanoscale integrated photonic devices and circuits offer a path to ultra-low
power computation at the few-photon level. Here we propose an optical circuit
that performs a ubiquitous operation: the controlled, random-access readout of
a collection of stored memory phases or, equivalently, the computation of the
inner product of a vector of phases with a binary ""selector"" vector, where the
arithmetic is done modulo 2pi and the result is encoded in the phase of a
coherent field. This circuit, a collection of cascaded interferometers driven
by a coherent input field, demonstrates the use of coherence as a computational
resource, and of the use of recently-developed mathematical tools for modeling
optical circuits with many coupled parts. The construction extends in a
straightforward way to the computation of matrix-vector and matrix-matrix
products, and, with the inclusion of an optical feedback loop, to the
computation of a ""weighted"" readout of stored memory phases. We note some
applications of these circuits for error correction and for computing tasks
requiring fast vector inner products, e.g. statistical classification and some
machine learning algorithms.
"
358,Quantum Cost Optimization for Reversible Sequential Circuit,"  Reversible sequential circuits are going to be the significant memory blocks
for the forthcoming computing devices for their ultra low power consumption.
Therefore design of various types of latches has been considered a major
objective for the researchers quite a long time. In this paper we proposed
efficient design of reversible sequential circuits that are optimized in terms
of quantum cost, delay and garbage outputs. For this we proposed a new 3*3
reversible gate called SAM gate and we then design efficient sequential
circuits using SAM gate along with some of the basic reversible logic gates.
"
359,Efficient Design of Reversible Sequential Circuit,"  Reversible logic has come to the forefront of theoretical and applied
research today. Although many researchers are investigating techniques to
synthesize reversible combinational logic, there is little work in the area of
sequential reversible logic. Latches and flip-flops are the most significant
memory elements for the forthcoming sequential memory elements. In this paper,
we proposed two new reversible logic gates MG-1 and MG-2. We then proposed new
design techniques for latches and flip-flops with the help of the new proposed
gates. The proposed designs are better than the existing ones in terms of
number of gates, garbage outputs and delay.
"
360,"RTI Goes Wild: Radio Tomographic Imaging for Outdoor People Detection
  and Localization","  RF sensor networks are used to localize people indoor without requiring them
to wear invasive electronic devices. These wireless mesh networks, formed by
low-power radio transceivers, continuously measure the received signal strength
(RSS) of the links. Radio Tomographic Imaging (RTI) is a technique that
generates 2D images of the change in the electromagnetic field inside the area
covered by the radio transceivers to spot the presence and movements of
animates (e.g., people, large animals) or large metallic objects (e.g., cars).
Here, we present a RTI system for localizing and tracking people outdoors.
Differently than in indoor environments where the RSS does not change
significantly with time unless people are found in the monitored area, the
outdoor RSS signal is time-variant, e.g., due to rainfalls or wind-driven
foliage. We present a novel outdoor RTI method that, despite the nonstationary
noise introduced in the RSS data by the environment, achieves high localization
accuracy and dramatically reduces the energy consumption of the sensing units.
Experimental results demonstrate that the system accurately detects and tracks
a person in real-time in a large forested area under varying environmental
conditions, significantly reducing false positives, localization error and
energy consumption compared to state-of-the-art RTI methods.
"
361,The expressive power of quantum walks in terms of language acceptance,"  Discrete time quantum walks are known to be universal for quantum
computation. This has been proven by showing that they can simulate a universal
quantum gate set. In this paper, we examine computation by quantum walks in
terms of language acceptance, and present two ways in which discrete time
quantum walks can accept some languages with certainty. These walks can take
quantum as well as classical inputs, and we show that when the input is
quantum, the walks can also be interpreted as performing the task of quantum
state discrimination.
"
362,"Limits on the performance of Infotaxis under inaccurate modelling of the
  environment","  We study the performance of infotaxis search strategy measured by the rate of
success and mean search time, under changes in the environment parameters such
as diffusivity, rate of emission or wind velocity. We also investigate the drop
of performance caused by an innacurate modelling of the environment. Our
findings show that infotaxis remains robust as long as the estimated parameters
fall within a certain range around their true values, but the success rate
quickly drops making infotaxis no longer feasible if the searcher agent
severely underestimates or overestimates the real environment parameters. This
study places some limits on the performance of infotaxis, and thus it has
practical consequences for the design of infotaxis based machines to track and
detect an emitting source of chemicals or volatile substances.
"
363,Applying Spiking Neural Nets to Noise Shaping,"  -In recent years, there has been an increased focus on the mechanics of
information transmission in spiking neural networks. Especially the Noise
Shaping properties of these networks and their similarity to Delta-Sigma
Modulators has received a lot of attention. However, very little of the
research done in this area has focused on the effect the weights in these
networks have on the Noise Shaping properties and on post- processing of the
network output signal. This paper concerns itself with the various modes of
network operation and beneficial as well as detrimental effects which the
systematic generation of network weights can effect. Also, a method for
post-processing of the spiking output signal is introduced, bringing the output
signal more in line with conventional Delta-Sigma Modulators. Relevancy of this
research to industrial application of neural nets as building blocks of
oversampled A/D converters is shown. Also, further points of contention are
listed, which must be thoroughly researched to add to the above mentioned
applicability of spiking neural nets.
"
364,Gabor-like Image Filtering using a Neural Microcircuit,"  In this letter, we present an implementation of a neural microcircuit for
image processing employing Hebbian-adaptive learning. The neuronal circuit
utilizes only excitatory synapses to correlate action potentials, extracting
the uncorrelated ones, which contain significant image information. This
circuit is capable of approximating Gabor-like image filtering and other image
processing functions
"
365,Integration Testing of Heterotic Systems,"  Computational theory and practice generally focus on single-paradigm systems,
but relatively little is known about how best to combine components based on
radically different approaches (e.g., silicon chips and wetware) into a single
coherent system. In particular, while testing strategies for single-technology
components are generally well developed, it is unclear at present how to
perform integration testing on heterotic systems: can we develop a test-set
generation strategy for checking whether specified behaviours emerge (and
unwanted behaviours do not) when components based on radically different
technologies are combined within a single system?
  In this paper, we describe an approach to modelling multi-technology
heterotic systems using a general-purpose formal specification strategy based
on Eilenberg's X-machine model of computation. We show how this approach can be
used to represent disparate technologies within a single framework, and propose
a strategy for using these formal models for automatic heterotic test-set
generation. We illustrate our approach by showing how to derive a test set for
a heterotic system combining an X-machine-based device with a cell-based P
system (membrane system).
"
366,Cortical Processing with Thermodynamic-RAM,"  AHaH computing forms a theoretical framework from which a
biologically-inspired type of computing architecture can be built where, unlike
von Neumann systems, memory and processor are physically combined. In this
paper we report on an incremental step beyond the theoretical framework of AHaH
computing toward the development of a memristor-based physical neural
processing unit (NPU), which we call Thermodynamic-RAM (kT-RAM). While the
power consumption and speed dominance of such an NPU over von Neumann
architectures for machine learning applications is well appreciated,
Thermodynamic-RAM offers several advantages over other hardware approaches to
adaptation and learning. Benefits include general-purpose use, a simple yet
flexible instruction set and easy integration into existing digital platforms.
We present a high level design of kT-RAM and a formal definition of its
instruction set. We report the completion of a kT-RAM emulator and the
successful port of all previous machine learning benchmark applications
including unsupervised clustering, supervised and unsupervised classification,
complex signal prediction, unsupervised robotic actuation and combinatorial
optimization. Lastly, we extend a previous MNIST hand written digits benchmark
application, to show that an extra step of reading the synaptic states of AHaH
nodes during the train phase (healing) alone results in plasticity that
improves the classifier's performance, bumping our best F1 score up to 99.5%.
"
367,"Universal Computation with Arbitrary Polyomino Tiles in Non-Cooperative
  Self-Assembly","  In this paper we explore the power of geometry to overcome the limitations of
non-cooperative self-assembly. We define a generalization of the abstract Tile
Assembly Model (aTAM), such that a tile system consists of a collection of
polyomino tiles, the Polyomino Tile Assembly Model (polyTAM), and investigate
the computational powers of polyTAM systems at temperature 1, where attachment
among tiles occurs without glue cooperation. Systems composed of the
unit-square tiles of the aTAM at temperature 1 are believed to be incapable of
Turing universal computation (while cooperative systems, with temperature > 1,
are able). As our main result, we prove that for any polyomino $P$ of size 3 or
greater, there exists a temperature-1 polyTAM system containing only shape-$P$
tiles that is computationally universal. Our proof leverages the geometric
properties of these larger (relative to the aTAM) tiles and their abilities to
effectively utilize geometric blocking of particular growth paths of
assemblies, while allowing others to complete.
  To round out our main result, we provide strong evidence that size-1 (i.e.
aTAM tiles) and size-2 polyomino systems are unlikely to be computationally
universal by showing that such systems are incapable of geometric bit-reading,
which is a technique common to all currently known temperature-1
computationally universal systems. We further show that larger polyominoes with
a limited number of binding positions are unlikely to be computationally
universal, as they are only as powerful as temperature-1 aTAM systems. Finally,
we connect our work with other work on domino self-assembly to show that
temperature-1 assembly with at least 2 distinct shapes, regardless of the
shapes or their sizes, allows for universal computation.
"
368,Embedding of Large Boolean Functions for Reversible Logic,"  Reversible logic represents the basis for many emerging technologies and has
recently been intensively studied. However, most of the Boolean functions of
practical interest are irreversible and must be embedded into a reversible
function before they can be synthesized. Thus far, an optimal embedding is
guaranteed only for small functions, whereas a significant overhead results
when large functions are considered. In this paper, we study this issue. We
prove that determining an optimal embedding is coNP-hard already for restricted
cases. Then, we propose heuristic and exact methods for determining both the
number of additional lines as well as a corresponding embedding. For the
approaches we considered sums of products and binary decision diagrams as
function representations. Experimental evaluations show the applicability of
the approaches for large functions. Consequently, the reversible embedding of
large functions is enabled as a precursor to subsequent synthesis.
"
369,Actin automata: Phenomenology and localizations,"  Actin is a globular protein which forms long filaments in the eukaryotic
cytoskeleton, whose roles in cell function include structural support,
contractile activity to intracellular signalling. We model actin filaments as
two chains of one-dimensional binary-state semi-totalistic automaton arrays to
describe hypothetical signalling events therein. Each node of the actin
automaton takes state `0' (resting) or `1' (excited) and updates its state in
discrete time depending on its neighbour's states. We analyse the complete rule
space of actin automata using integral characteristics of space-time
configurations generated by these rules and compute state transition rules that
support travelling and mobile localizations. Approaches towards selection of
the localisation supporting rules using the global characteristics are
outlined. We find that some properties of actin automata rules may be predicted
using Shannon entropy, activity and incoherence of excitation between the
polymer chains. We also show that it is possible to infer whether a given rule
supports travelling or stationary localizations by looking at ratios of excited
neighbours are essential for generations of the localizations. We conclude by
applying biomolecular hypotheses to this model and discuss the significance of
our findings in context with cell signalling and emergent behaviour in cellular
computation.
"
370,Limits on Fundamental Limits to Computation,"  An indispensable part of our lives, computing has also become essential to
industries and governments. Steady improvements in computer hardware have been
supported by periodic doubling of transistor densities in integrated circuits
over the last fifty years. Such Moore scaling now requires increasingly heroic
efforts, stimulating research in alternative hardware and stirring controversy.
To help evaluate emerging technologies and enrich our understanding of
integrated-circuit scaling, we review fundamental limits to computation: in
manufacturing, energy, physical space, design and verification effort, and
algorithms. To outline what is achievable in principle and in practice, we
recall how some limits were circumvented, compare loose and tight limits. We
also point out that engineering difficulties encountered by emerging
technologies may indicate yet-unknown limits.

371,"Ancilla-free synthesis of large reversible functions using binary
  decision diagrams","  The synthesis of reversible functions has been an intensively studied
research area in the last decade. Since almost all proposed approaches rely on
representations of exponential size (such as truth tables and permutations),
they cannot be applied efficiently to reversible functions with more than 15
variables.
  In this paper, we propose an ancilla-free synthesis approach based on Young
subgroups using symbolic function representations that can efficiently be
implemented with binary decision diagrams (BDDs). As a result, the algorithm
not only allows to synthesize large reversible functions without adding extra
lines, called ancilla, but also leads to significantly smaller circuits
compared to existing approaches.
"
372,"Facts, myths and fights about the KLJN classical physical key exchanger","  This paper deals with the Kirchhoff-law-Johnson-noise (KLJN) classical
statistical physical key exchange method and surveys criticism - often stemming
from a lack of understanding of its underlying premises or from other errors -
and our related responses against these, often unphysical, claims. Some of the
attacks are valid, however, an extended KLJN system remains protected against
all of them, implying that its unconditional security is not impacted.
"
373,Bird's-eye view on Noise-Based Logic,"  Noise-based logic is a practically deterministic logic scheme inspired by the
randomness of neural spikes and uses a system of uncorrelated stochastic
processes and their superposition to represent the logic state. We briefly
discuss various questions such as (i) What does practical determinism mean?
(ii) Is noise-based logic a Turing machine? (iii) Is there hope to beat (the
dreams of) quantum computation by a classical physical noise-based processor,
and what are the minimum hardware requirements for that? Finally, (iv) we
address the problem of random number generators and show that the common belief
that quantum number generators are superior to classical (thermal) noise-based
generators is nothing but a myth.
"
374,Brain: Biological noise-based logic,"  Neural spikes in the brain form stochastic sequences, i.e., belong to the
class of pulse noises. This stochasticity is a counterintuitive feature because
extracting information - such as the commonly supposed neural information of
mean spike frequency - requires long times for reasonably low error
probability. The mystery could be solved by noise-based logic, wherein
randomness has an important function and allows large speed enhancements for
special-purpose tasks, and the same mechanism is at work for the brain logic
version of this concept.
"
375,The exact synthesis of 1- and 2-qubit Clifford+T circuits,"  We describe a new method for the decomposition of an arbitrary $n$ qubit
operator with entries in $\mathbb{Z}[i,\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}]$, i.e., of the form
$(a+b\sqrt{2}+i(c+d\sqrt{2}))/{\sqrt{2}^{k}}$, into Clifford+$T$ operators
where $n\le 2$. This method achieves a bound of $O(k)$ gates using at most one
ancilla using decomposition into $1$- and $2$-level matrices which was first
proposed by Giles and Selinger.
"
376,Memcomputing and Swarm Intelligence,"  We explore the relation between memcomputing, namely computing with and in
memory, and swarm intelligence algorithms. In particular, we show that one can
design memristive networks to solve short-path optimization problems that can
also be solved by ant-colony algorithms. By employing appropriate memristive
elements one can demonstrate an almost one-to-one correspondence between
memcomputing and ant colony optimization approaches. However, the memristive
network has the capability of finding the solution in one deterministic step,
compared to the stochastic multi-step ant colony optimization. This result
paves the way for nanoscale hardware implementations of several swarm
intelligence algorithms that are presently explored, from scheduling problems
to robotics.
"
377,"Perceptrons with Hebbian learning based on wave ensembles in plastic
  potentials","  A general scheme to realize a perceptron for hardware neural networks is
presented, where multiple interconnections are achieved by a superposition of
Schrodinger waves. Spatially patterned potentials process information by
coupling different points of reciprocal space. The necessary potential shape is
obtained from the Hebbian learning rule, either through exact calculation or
construction from a superposition of known optical inputs. This allows
implementation in a wide range of compact optical systems, including: 1) any
non-linear optical system; 2) optical systems patterned by optical lithography;
and 3) exciton-polariton systems with phonon or nuclear spin interactions.
"
378,"DNA, Human Memory, and the Storage Technology of the 21st Century","  The sophisticated tools and techniques employed by Nature for purposeful
storage of information stand in stark contrast to the primitive and relatively
inefficient means used by man. We describe some impressive features of
biological data storage, and speculate on approaches to research and
development that could benefit the storage industry in the coming decades.
"
379,"OTA based 200 G{\Omega} resistance on 700 {\mu}m2 in 180 nm CMOS for
  neuromorphic applications","  Generating an exponential decay function with a time constant on the order of
hundreds of milliseconds is a mainstay for neuromorphic circuits. Usually,
either subthreshold circuits or RC-decays based on transconductance amplifiers
are used. In the latter case, transconductances in the 10 pS range are needed.
However, state-of-the-art low-transconductance amplifiers still require too
much circuit area to be applicable in neuromorphic circuits where >100 of these
time constant circuits may be required on a single chip. We present a silicon
verified operational transconductance amplifier that achieves a gm of 5 pS in
only 700 {\mu}m2, a factor of 10-100 less area than current examples. This
allows a high-density integration of time constant circuits in target
appliations such as synaptic learning or as driving circuit for neuromorphic
memristor arrays.
"
380,Efficient synthesis of probabilistic quantum circuits with fallback,"  Recently it has been shown that Repeat-Until-Success (RUS) circuits can
approximate a given single-qubit unitary with an expected number of $T$ gates
of about $1/3$ of what is required by optimal, deterministic, ancilla-free
decompositions over the Clifford+$T$ gate set. In this work, we introduce a
more general and conceptually simpler circuit decomposition method that allows
for synthesis into protocols that probabilistically implement quantum circuits
over several universal gate sets including, but not restricted to, the
Clifford+$T$ gate set. The protocol, which we call Probabilistic Quantum
Circuits with Fallback (PQF), implements a walk on a discrete Markov chain in
which the target unitary is an absorbing state and in which transitions are
induced by multi-qubit unitaries followed by measurements. In contrast to RUS
protocols, the presented PQF protocols terminate after a finite number of
steps. Specifically, we apply our method to the Clifford+$T$, Clifford+$V$, and
Clifford+$\pi/12$ gate sets to achieve decompositions with expected gate counts
of $\log_b(1/\varepsilon)+O(\log(\log(1/\varepsilon)))$, where $b$ is a
quantity related to the expansion property of the underlying universal gate
set.
"
381,Advances in Macromolecular Data Storage,"  We propose to develop a new method of information storage to replace magnetic
hard disk drives and other instruments of secondary/backup data storage. The
proposed method stores petabytes of user-data in a sugar cube (1 cm3), and can
read/write that information at hundreds of megabits/sec. Digital information is
recorded and stored in the form of a long macromolecule consisting of at least
two bases, A and B. (This would be similar to DNA strands constructed from the
four nucleic acids G,C,A,T.) The macromolecules initially enter the system as
blank slates. A macromolecule with, say, 10,000 identical bases in the form of
AAAAA....AAA may be used to record a kilobyte block of user-data (including
modulation and error-correction coding), although, in this blank state, it can
only represent the null sequence 00000....000. Suppose this blank string of A's
is dragged before an atomically-sharp needle of a scanning tunneling microscope
(STM). When electric pulses are applied to the needle in accordance with the
sequence of 0s and 1s of a 1 kB block of user-data, selected A molecules will
be transformed into B molecules (e.g., a fraction of A will be broken off and
discarded). The resulting string now encodes the user-data in the form of
AABABBA...BAB. The same STM needle can subsequently read the recorded
information, as A and B would produce different electric signals when the
strand passes under the needle. The macromolecule now represents a data block
to be stored in a ""parking lot"" within the sugar cube, and later brought to a
read station on demand. Millions of parking spots and thousands of Read/Write
stations may be integrated within the micro-fabricated sugar cube, thus
providing access to petabytes of user-data in a scheme that benefits from the
massive parallelism of thousands of Read/Write stations within the same
three-dimensionally micro-structured device.
"
382,Optimal ancilla-free Clifford+V approximation of z-rotations,"  We describe a new efficient algorithm to approximate z-rotations by
ancilla-free Clifford+V circuits, up to a given precision epsilon. Our
algorithm is optimal in the presence of an oracle for integer factoring: it
outputs the shortest Clifford+V circuit solving the given problem instance. In
the absence of such an oracle, our algorithm is still near-optimal, producing
circuits of V-count m + O(log(log(1/epsilon))), where m is the V-count of the
third-to-optimal solution. A restricted version of the algorithm approximates
z-rotations in the Pauli+V gate set. Our method is based on previous work by
the author and Selinger on the optimal ancilla-free approximation of
z-rotations using Clifford+T gates and on previous work by Bocharov, Gurevich,
and Svore on the asymptotically optimal ancilla-free approximation of
z-rotations using Clifford+V gates.
"
383,On the physical and circuit-theoretic significance of the Memristor,"  It is noticed that the inductive and capacitive features of the memristor
reflect (and are a quintessence of) such features of any resistor. The very
presence in the resistive characteristic v = f(i) of the voltage and current
state variables, associated by their electrodynamics sense with electrical and
magnetic fields, forces any resister to cause to accumulate some magnetic and
electrostatic fields and energies around itself. The present version is
strongly extended in the sense of the circuit theory discussion.
"
384,"Design and Analysis of Wireless Communication Systems Using
  Diffusion-Based Molecular Communication Among Bacteria","  The design of biologically-inspired wireless communication systems using
bacteria as the basic element of the system is initially motivated by a
phenomenon called \emph{Quorum Sensing}. Due to high randomness in the
individual behavior of a bacterium, reliable communication between two bacteria
is almost impossible. Therefore, we have recently proposed that a population of
bacteria in a cluster is considered as a bio node in the network capable of
molecular transmission and reception. This proposition enables us to form a
reliable bio node out of many unreliable bacteria.
  In this paper, we study the communication between two nodes in such a network
where information is encoded in the concentration of molecules by the
transmitter. The molecules produced by the bacteria in the transmitter node
propagate through the diffusion channel. Then, the concentration of molecules
is sensed by the bacteria population in the receiver node which would decode
the information and output light or fluorescent as a result. The uncertainty in
the communication is caused by all three components of communication, i.e.,
transmission, propagation and reception. We study the theoretical limits of the
information transfer rate in the presence of such uncertainties. Finally, we
consider M-ary signaling schemes and study their achievable rates and
corresponding error probabilities.
"
385,Relaying in Diffusion-Based Molecular Communication,"  Molecular communication between biological entities is a new paradigm in
communications. Recently, we studied molecular communication between two nodes
formed from synthetic bacteria. Due to high randomness in behavior of bacteria,
we used a population of them in each node. The reliability of such
communication systems depends on both the maximum concentration of molecules
that a transmitter node is able to produce at the receiver node as well as the
number of bacteria in each nodes. This maximum concentration of molecules falls
with distance which makes the communication to the far nodes nearly impossible.
In order to alleviate this problem, in this paper, we propose to use a
molecular relaying node. The relay node can resend the message either by the
different or the same type of molecules as the original signal from the
transmitter. We study two scenarios of relaying. In the first scenario, the
relay node simply senses the received concentration and forwards it to the
receiver. We show that this sense and forward scenario, depending on the type
of molecules used for relaying, results in either increasing the range of
concentration of molecules at the receiver or increasing the effective number
of bacteria in the receiver node. For both cases of sense and forward relaying,
we obtain the resulting improvement in channel capacity. We conclude that
multi-type molecular relaying outperforms the single-type relaying. In the
second scenario, we study the decode and forward relaying for the M-ary
signaling scheme. We show that this relaying strategy increases the reliability
of M-ary communication significantly.
"
386,Spin Orbit Torque Based Electronic Neuron,"  A device based on current-induced spin-orbit torque (SOT) that functions as
an electronic neuron is proposed in this work. The SOT device implements an
artificial neuron's thresholding (transfer) function. In the first step of a
two-step switching scheme, a charge current places the magnetization of a
nano-magnet along the hard-axis i.e. an unstable point for the magnet. In the
second step, the SOT device (neuron) receives a current (from the synapses)
which moves the magnetization from the unstable point to one of the two stable
states. The polarity of the synaptic current encodes the excitatory and
inhibitory nature of the neuron input, and determines the final orientation of
the magnetization. A resistive crossbar array, functioning as synapses,
generates a bipolar current that is a weighted sum of the inputs. The
simulation of a two layer feed-forward Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based on
the SOT electronic neuron shows that it consumes ~3X lower power than a 45nm
digital CMOS implementation, while reaching ~80% accuracy in the classification
of one hundred images of handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.
"
387,"Memristive Threshold Logic Circuit Design of Fast Moving Object
  Detection","  Real-time detection of moving objects involves memorisation of features in
the template image and their comparison with those in the test image. At high
sampling rates, such techniques face the problems of high algorithmic
complexity and component delays. We present a new resistive switching based
threshold logic cell which encodes the pixels of a template image. The cell
comprises a voltage divider circuit that programs the resistances of the
memristors arranged in a single node threshold logic network and the output is
encoded as a binary value using a CMOS inverter gate. When a test image is
applied to the template-programmed cell, a mismatch in the respective pixels is
seen as a change in the output voltage of the cell. The proposed cell when
compared with CMOS equivalent implementation shows improved performance in
area, leakage power, power dissipation and delay.
"
388,A Stochastic Model for Electron Transfer in Bacterial Cables,"  Biological systems are known to communicate by diffusing chemical signals in
the surrounding medium. However, most of the recent literature has neglected
the electron transfer mechanism occurring amongst living cells, and its role in
cell-cell communication. Each cell relies on a continuous flow of electrons
from its electron donor to its electron acceptor through the electron transport
chain to produce energy in the form of the molecule adenosine triphosphate, and
to sustain the cell's vital operations and functions. While the importance of
biological electron transfer is well-known for individual cells, the past
decade has also brought about remarkable discoveries of multi-cellular
microbial communities that transfer electrons between cells and across
centimeter length scales, e.g., biofilms and multi-cellular bacterial cables.
These experimental observations open up new frontiers in the design of
electron-based communications networks in microbial communities, which may
coexist with the more well-known communication strategies based on molecular
diffusion, while benefiting from a much shorter communication delay. This paper
develops a stochastic model that links the electron transfer mechanism to the
energetic state of the cell. The model is also extensible to larger
communities, by allowing for electron exchange between neighboring cells.
Moreover, the parameters of the stochastic model are fit to experimental data
available in the literature, and are shown to provide a good fit.
"
389,A Complementary Resistive Switch-based Crossbar Array Adder,"  Redox-based resistive switching devices (ReRAM) are an emerging class of
non-volatile storage elements suited for nanoscale memory applications. In
terms of logic operations, ReRAM devices were suggested to be used as
programmable interconnects, large-scale look-up tables or for sequential logic
operations. However, without additional selector devices these approaches are
not suited for use in large scale nanocrossbar memory arrays, which is the
preferred architecture for ReRAM devices due to the minimum area consumption.
To overcome this issue for the sequential logic approach, we recently
introduced a novel concept, which is suited for passive crossbar arrays using
complementary resistive switches (CRSs). CRS cells offer two high resistive
storage states, and thus, parasitic sneak currents are efficiently avoided.
However, until now the CRS-based logic-in-memory approach was only shown to be
able to perform basic Boolean logic operations using a single CRS cell. In this
paper, we introduce two multi-bit adder schemes using the CRS-based
logic-in-memory approach. We proof the concepts by means of SPICE simulations
using a dynamical memristive device model of a ReRAM cell. Finally, we show the
advantages of our novel adder concept in terms of step count and number of
devices in comparison to a recently published adder approach, which applies the
conventional ReRAM-based sequential logic concept introduced by Borghetti et
al.
"
390,Synthesis of Sequential Reversible Circuits through Finite State Machine,"  Reversible computing has attracted the attention of researchers due to its
low power consumption and less heat dissipation compared to conventional
computing. A number of reversible gates have been proposed by different
researchers and various combinational circuits based on reversible gates have
been developed. However the realization of sequential circuit in reversible
logic is still at premature stage. Sequential circuits were not available
because of feedback was not allowed in reversible circuit. However allowing
feedback in space (not in time), some sequential reversible gates and circuits
have been reported in the literature. In this dissertation, we have addressed
the problem from two sides. One side is to propose a low cost reversible gate
suitable for sequential building block i.e. T flip-flop and hence designing low
cost synchronous and asynchronous counters. Another side is to generate the
circuit from its behavioral description described in FSM form. Our propose
designs of reversible counters are significantly better in optimization
parameters such as gate counts, garbage outputs and constant inputs available
in literature. We have also proposed a procedure for obtaining reversible
circuit from behavioral description through FSM. A very few attempts have been
reported in the literature for the conversion FSM to reversible FSM.Because of
non-availability of generated sequential reversible circuit in literature, our
results cannot be compared with any other circuits. We expect that the
sequential reversible circuits will help in debugging the reversible circuits,
handling the ambiguous state of an FSM and generating the original input in
reverse direction by reversing the original output.
"
391,"A New Gate for Optimal Fault Tolerant & Testable Reversible Sequential
  Circuit Design","  With phenomenal growth of high speed and complex computing applications, the
design of low power and high speed logic circuits have created tremendous
interest. Conventional computing devices are based on irreversible logic and
further reduction in power consumption and/or increase in speed appears
non-promising. Reversible computing has emerged as a solution looking to the
power and speed requirements of future computing devices. In reversible
computing logic gates used are such that input can be generated by reversing
the operation from output. A number of reversible combinational circuits have
been developed but the growth of sequential circuits was not significant due to
feedback and fanout was not allowed. However, allowing feedback in space, a
very few sequential logic blocks i.e. flip-flops have been reported in
literature. In order to develop sequential circuits, flip-flops are used in
conventional circuits. Also good circuit design methods, optimized and fault
tolerant designs are also needed to build large, complex and reliable circuits
in conventional computing. Reversible flip-flops are the basic memory elements
that will be the building block of memory for reversible computing and quantum
computing devices. In this dissertation we plan to address above issues. First
we have proposed a Pareek gate suitable for low-cost flip-flops design and then
design methodology to develop flip-flops are illustrated. Further almost all
flip-flops and some example circuit have been developed and finally these
circuits have been converted into fault tolerant circuits by preserving their
parity and designs of offline as well as online testable circuits have been
proposed. In this dissertation work, we have also compared quantum cost as well
as other parameters with existing circuits and shown a significant improvement
in almost all parameters.
"
392,Algorithm engineering for a quantum annealing platform,"  Recent advances bring within reach the viability of solving combinatorial
problems using a quantum annealing algorithm implemented on a purpose-built
platform that exploits quantum properties. However, the question of how to tune
the algorithm for most effective use in this framework is not well understood.
In this paper we describe some operational parameters that drive performance,
discuss approaches for mitigating sources of error, and present experimental
results from a D-Wave Two quantum annealing processor.
"
393,"Laser Induced Magnetization Reversal for Detection in Optical
  Interconnects","  Optical interconnect has emerged as the front-runner to replace electrical
interconnect especially for off-chip communication. However, a major drawback
with optical interconnects is the need for photodetectors and amplifiers at the
receiver, implemented usually by direct bandgap semiconductors and analog CMOS
circuits, leading to large energy consumption and slow operating time. In this
article, we propose a new optical interconnect architecture that uses a
magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) at the receiver side that is switched by
femtosecond laser pulses. The state of the MTJ can be sensed using simple
digital CMOS latches, resulting in significant improvement in energy
consumption. Moreover, magnetization in the MTJ can be switched on the
picoseconds time-scale and our design can operate at a speed of 5 Gbits/sec for
a single link.
"
394,Memcomputing with membrane memcapacitive systems,"  We show theoretically that networks of membrane memcapacitive systems --
capacitors with memory made out of membrane materials -- can be used to perform
a complete set of logic gates in a massively parallel way by simply changing
the external input amplitudes, but not the topology of the network. This
polymorphism is an important characteristic of memcomputing (computing with
memories) that closely reproduces one of the main features of the brain. A
practical realization of these membrane memcapacitive systems, using, e.g.,
graphene or other 2D materials, would be a step forward towards a solid-state
realization of memcomputing with passive devices.
"
395,A Comprehensive Survey of Recent Advancements in Molecular Communication,"  With much advancement in the field of nanotechnology, bioengineering and
synthetic biology over the past decade, microscales and nanoscales devices are
becoming a reality. Yet the problem of engineering a reliable communication
system between tiny devices is still an open problem. At the same time, despite
the prevalence of radio communication, there are still areas where traditional
electromagnetic waves find it difficult or expensive to reach. Points of
interest in industry, cities, and medical applications often lie in embedded
and entrenched areas, accessible only by ventricles at scales too small for
conventional radio waves and microwaves, or they are located in such a way that
directional high frequency systems are ineffective. Inspired by nature, one
solution to these problems is molecular communication (MC), where chemical
signals are used to transfer information. Although biologists have studied MC
for decades, it has only been researched for roughly 10 year from a
communication engineering lens. Significant number of papers have been
published to date, but owing to the need for interdisciplinary work, much of
the results are preliminary. In this paper, the recent advancements in the
field of MC engineering are highlighted. First, the biological, chemical, and
physical processes used by an MC system are discussed. This includes different
components of the MC transmitter and receiver, as well as the propagation and
transport mechanisms. Then, a comprehensive survey of some of the recent works
on MC through a communication engineering lens is provided. The paper ends with
a technology readiness analysis of MC and future research directions.
"
396,"Redesigning Commercial Floating-Gate Memory for Analog Computing
  Applications","  We have modified a commercial NOR flash memory array to enable high-precision
tuning of individual floating-gate cells for analog computing applications. The
modified array area per cell in a 180 nm process is about 1.5 um^2. While this
area is approximately twice the original cell size, it is still at least an
order of magnitude smaller than in the state-of-the-art analog circuit
implementations. The new memory cell arrays have been successfully tested, in
particular confirming that each cell may be automatically tuned, with ~1%
precision, to any desired subthreshold readout current value within an almost
three-orders-of-magnitude dynamic range, even using an unoptimized tuning
algorithm. Preliminary results for a four-quadrant vector-by-matrix multiplier,
implemented with the modified memory array gate-coupled with additional
peripheral floating-gate transistors, show highly linear transfer
characteristics over a broad range of input currents.
"
397,Boolean Computation Using Self-Sustaining Nonlinear Oscillators,"  Self-sustaining nonlinear oscillators of practically any type can function as
latches and registers if Boolean logic states are represented physically as the
phase of oscillatory signals. Combinational operations on such phase-encoded
logic signals can be implemented using arithmetic negation and addition
followed by amplitude limiting. With these, general-purpose Boolean computation
using a wide variety of natural and engineered oscillators becomes potentially
possible. Such phase-encoded logic shows promise for energy efficient
computing. It also has inherent noise immunity advantages over traditional
level-based logic.
"
398,"Arrival Modeling and Error Analysis for Molecular Communication via
  Diffusion with Drift","  The arrival of molecules in molecular communication via diffusion (MCvD) is a
counting process, exhibiting by its nature binomial distribution. Even if the
binomial process describes well the arrival of molecules, when considering
consecutively sent symbols, the process struggles to work with the binomial
cumulative distribution function (CDF). Therefore, in the literature, Poisson
and Gaussian approximations of the binomial distribution are used. In this
paper, we analyze these two approximations of the binomial model of the arrival
process in MCvD with drift. Considering the distance, drift velocity, and the
number of emitted molecules, we investigate the regions in which either Poisson
or Gaussian model is better in terms of root mean squared error (RMSE) of the
CDFs; we confirm the boundaries of the region via numerical simulations.
Moreover, we derive the error probabilities for continuous communication and
analyze which model approximates it more accurately.
"
399,"Effect of Degradation in Molecular Communication: Impairment or
  Enhancement?","  In the nanonetworking literature, many solutions have been suggested to
enable the nanomachine-to-nanomachine communication. Among these solutions, we
focus on what constitutes the basis for molecular communication paradigms
--molecular communication via diffusion (MCvD). In this paper, we start with an
analytical modeling of a spherical absorbing receiver under messenger molecule
degradation and show that our formulations are in agreement with the simulation
results of a similar topology. Next, we identify how such signal
characteristics as pulse peak time and pulse amplitude are affected by
degradation. Indeed, we show analytically how in MCvD, signal shaping is
achieved through degradation. We also compare communication under messenger
molecule degradation with the case of no-degradation and electromagnetic
communication in terms of channel characteristics. Lastly, we evaluate the
communication performance of the scenarios having various degradation rates.
Here, we assess the system performance according to traditional network metrics
such as the level of inter-symbol interference, detection performance, bit
error rate, and channel capacity. Our results indicate that introducing
degradation significantly improves the system performance when the rate of
degradation is appropriately selected. We make a thorough analysis of the
communication scenario by taking into account different detection thresholds,
symbol durations, and communication distances.
"
400,ISI Mitigation Techniques in Molecular Communication,"  Molecular communication is a new field of communication where molecules are
used to transfer information. Among the proposed methods, molecular
communication via diffusion (MCvD) is particularly effective. One of the main
challenges in MCvD is the intersymbol interference (ISI), which inhibits
communication at high data rates. Furthermore, at the nano scale, energy
efficiency becomes an essential problem. Before addressing these problems, a
pre-determined threshold for the received signal must be calculated to make a
decision. In this paper, an analytical technique is proposed to determine the
optimum threshold, whereas in the literature, these thresholds are generally
calculated empirically. Since the main goal of this paper is to build an MCvD
system suitable for operating at high data rates without sacrificing quality,
new modulation and filtering techniques are proposed to decrease the effects of
ISI and enhance energy efficiency. As a transmitter-based solution, a
modulation technique for MCvD, molecular transition shift keying (MTSK), is
proposed in order to increase the data rate via suppressing the ISI.
Furthermore, for energy efficiency, a power adjustment technique that utilizes
the residual molecules is proposed. Finally, as a receiver-based solution, a
new energy efficient decision feedback filter (DFF) is proposed as a substitute
for the decoders such as minimum mean squared error (MMSE) and decision
feedback equalizer (DFE). The error performance of DFF and MMSE equalizers are
compared in terms of bit error rates, and it is concluded that DFF may be more
advantageous when energy efficiency is concerned, due to its lower
computational complexity.
"
401,"Verifying Chemical Reaction Network Implementations: A Pathway
  Decomposition Approach","  Here we focus on the challenge of verifying the correctness of molecular
implementations of abstract chemical reaction networks, where operation in a
well-mixed ""soup"" of molecules is stochastic, asynchronous, concurrent, and
often involves multiple intermediate steps in the implementation, parallel
pathways, and side reactions. This problem relates to the verification of Petri
nets, but existing approaches are not sufficient for providing a single
guarantee covering an infinite set of possible initial states (molecule counts)
and an infinite state space potentially explored by the system given any
initial state. We address these issues by formulating a new theory of pathway
decomposition that provides an elegant formal basis for comparing chemical
reaction network implementations, and we present an algorithm that computes
this basis. Our theory naturally handles certain situations that commonly arise
in molecular implementations, such as what we call ""delayed choice,"" that are
not easily accommodated by other approaches. We further show how pathway
decomposition can be combined with weak bisimulation to handle a wider class
that includes most currently known enzyme-free DNA implementation techniques.
We anticipate that our notion of logical equivalence between chemical reaction
network implementations will be valuable for other molecular implementations
such as biochemical enzyme systems, and perhaps even more broadly in
concurrency theory.
"
402,"Logic gates and complex dynamics in a hexagonal cellular automaton: the
  Spiral rule","  In previous works, hexagonal cellular automata (CA) have been studied as a
variation of the famous Game of Life CA, mainly for spiral phenomena
simulations; where the most interesting constructions are related to the
Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction. In this paper, we analyse a special kind of
hexagonal CA, {\it Spiral rule}. Such automaton shows a non-trivial complex
behaviour related to discrete models of reaction-diffusion chemical media,
dominated by spiral guns which easily emerge from random initial conditions.
The computing capabilities of this automaton are shown by means of logic gates.
These are defined by collisions between mobile localizations. Also, an extended
classification of complex self-localisation patterns is presented, including
some self-organised patterns.
"
403,More Tight Bounds for Active Self-Assembly Using an Insertion Primitive,"  We prove several limits on the behavior of a model of self-assembling
particles introduced by Dabby and Chen (SODA 2013), called insertion systems,
where monomers insert themselves into the middle of a growing linear polymer.
First, we prove that the expressive power of these systems is equal to
context-free grammars, answering a question posed by Dabby and Chen.
  Second, we give tight bounds on the maximum length and minimum expected time
of constructed polymers in systems of three increasingly restricted classes. We
prove that systems of $k$ monomer types can deterministically construct
polymers of length $n = 2^{\Theta(k^{3/2})}$ in $O(\log^{5/3}(n))$ expected
time. We also prove that if non-deterministic construction of a finite number
of polymers is permitted, then the expected construction time can be reduced to
$O(\log^{3/2}(n))$ at the trade-off of decreasing the length to
$2^{\Theta(k)}$. If the system is allowed to construct an infinite number of
polymers, then constructing polymers of unbounded length in $O(\log{n})$
expected time is possible. We follow these positive results with a set of lower
bounds proving that these are the best possible polymer lengths and expected
construction times.

404,Optimal program-size complexity for self-assembly at temperature 1 in 3D,"  Working in a three-dimensional variant of Winfree's abstract Tile Assembly
Model, we show that, for all $N \in \mathbb{N}$, there is a tile set that
uniquely self-assembles into an $N \times N$ square shape at temperature 1 with
optimal program-size complexity of $O(\log N / \log \log N)$ (the program-size
complexity, also known as tile complexity, of a shape is the minimum number of
unique tile types required to uniquely self-assemble it). Moreover, our
construction is ""just barely"" 3D in the sense that it works even when the
placement of tiles is restricted to the $z = 0$ and $z = 1$ planes. This result
affirmatively answers an open question from Cook, Fu, Schweller (SODA 2011). To
achieve this result, we develop a general 3D temperature 1 optimal encoding
construction, reminiscent of the 2D temperature 2 optimal encoding construction
of Soloveichik and Winfree (SICOMP 2007), and perhaps of independent interest.
"
405,Reservoir computing with a single time-delay autonomous Boolean node,"  We demonstrate reservoir computing with a physical system using a single
autonomous Boolean logic element with time-delay feedback. The system generates
a chaotic transient with a window of consistency lasting between 30 and 300 ns,
which we show is sufficient for reservoir computing. We then characterize the
dependence of computational performance on system parameters to find the best
operating point of the reservoir. When the best parameters are chosen, the
reservoir is able to classify short input patterns with performance that
decreases over time. In particular, we show that four distinct input patterns
can be classified for 70 ns, even though the inputs are only provided to the
reservoir for 7.5 ns.
"
406,Spin Wave Neuroanalog of von Neumann's Microwave Computer,"  Frequency and phase of neural activity play important roles in the behaving
brain. The emerging understanding of these roles has been informed by the
design of analog devices that have been important to neuroscience, among them
the neuroanalog computer developed by O. Schmitt in the 1930's. In the 1950's,
J. von Neumann, in a search for high performance computing using microwaves,
invented a logic machine based on similar devices, that can perform logic
functions including binary arithmetic. Described here is a novel embodiment of
his machine using nano-magnetics. The embodiment is based on properties of
ferromagnetic thin films that are governed by a nonlinear Schrodinger equation
for magnetization in a film. Electrical currents through point contacts on a
film create spin torque nano oscillators (STNO) that define the oscillator
elements of the system. These oscillators may communicate through directed
graphs of electrical connections or by radiation in the form of spin waves. It
is shown here how to construct a logic machine using STNO, that this machine
can perform several computations simultaneously using multiplexing of inputs,
that this system can evaluate iterated logic functions, and that spin waves can
communicate frequency, phase and binary information. Neural tissue and the
Schmitt, von Neumann and STNO devices share a common bifurcation structure,
although these systems operate on vastly different space and time scales. This
suggests that neural circuits may be capable of computational functionality
described here.

407,Infinite Object Coating in the Amoebot Model,"  The term programmable matter refers to matter which has the ability to change
its physical properties (shape, density, moduli, conductivity, optical
properties, etc.) in a programmable fashion, based upon user input or
autonomous sensing. This has many applications like smart materials, autonomous
monitoring and repair, and minimal invasive surgery. While programmable matter
might have been considered pure science fiction more than two decades ago, in
recent years a large amount of research has been conducted in this field. Often
programmable matter is envisioned as a very large number of small locally
interacting computational particles. We propose the Amoebot model, a new model
which builds upon this vision of programmable matter. Inspired by the behavior
of amoeba, the Amoebot model offers a versatile framework to model
self-organizing particles and facilitates rigorous algorithmic research in the
area of programmable matter. We present an algorithm for the problem of coating
an infinite object under this model, and prove the correctness of the algorithm
and that it is work-optimal.

408,"On Timing Synchronization for Quantity-based Modulation in Additive
  Inverse Gaussian Channel with Drift","  In Diffusion-based Molecular Communications, the channel between Transmitter
Nano-machine (TN) and Receiver Nano-machine (RN) can be modeled by Additive
Inverse Gaussian Channel, that is the first hitting time of messenger molecule
released from TN and captured by RN follows Inverse Gaussian distribution. In
this channel, a quantity-based modulation embedding message on the different
quantity levels of messenger molecules relies on a time-slotted system between
TN and RN. Accordingly, their clocks need to synchronize with each other. In
this paper, we discuss the approaches to make RN estimate its timing offset
between TN efficiently by the arrival times of molecules. We propose many
methods such as Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE), Unbiased Linear Estimation
(ULE), Iterative ULE, and Decision Feedback (DF). The numerical results shows
the comparison of them. We evaluate these methods by not only the Mean Square
Error, but also the computational complexity.
"
409,"Performance Analysis for Energy Harvesting Communication Protocols with
  Fixed Rate Transmission","  Energy Harvesting (EH) has emerged as a promising technique for Green
Communications and it is a novel technique to prolong the lifetime of the
wireless networks with replenishable nodes. In this paper, we consider the
energy shortage analysis of fixed rate transmission in communication systems
with energy harvesting nodes. First, we study the finite-horizon transmission
and provide the general formula for the energy shortage probability. We also
give some examples as benchmarks. Then, we continue to derive a closed-form
expression for infinite-horizon transmission, which is a lower bound for the
energy shortage probability of any finite-horizon transmission. These results
are proposed for both Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) and fading channels.
Moreover, we show that even under \emph{random energy arrival}, one can
transmit at a fixed rate equal to capacity in the AWGN channels with negligible
aggregate shortage time. We achieve this result using our practical
transmission schemes, proposed for finite-horizon. Also, comprehensive
numerical simulations are performed in AWGN and fading channels with no Channel
State Information (CSI) available at the transmitter, which corroborate our
theoretical findings. Furthermore, we improve the performance of our
transmission schemes in the fading channel with no CSI at the transmitter by
optimizing the transmission initiation threshold.
"
410,Enhanced Modulation Technique for Molecular Communication: OOMoSK,"  Molecular communication in nanonetworks is an emerging communication paradigm
where molecules are used as information carriers. Concentration Shift Keying
(CSK) and Molecule Shift Keying (MoSK) are being studied extensively for the
short and medium range molecular nanonetworks. It is observed that MoSK
outperforms CSK. However, MoSK requires different types of molecules for
encoding which render transmitter and receiver complexities. We propose a
modulation scheme called On-Off MoSK (OOMoSK) in which, molecules are released
for information bit 1 and no molecule is released for 0. The proposed scheme
enjoys reduced number of the types of molecules for encoding. Numerical results
show that the proposed scheme enhances channel capacity and Symbol Error Rate
(SER).
"
411,"Power Allocation in the Energy Harvesting Full-Duplex Gaussian Relay
  Channels","  In this paper, we propose a general model to study the full-duplex
non-coherent decode-and-forward Gaussian relay channel with energy harvesting
(EH) nodes, called NC-EH-$\mathcal{RC}$, in three cases: $i)$ no energy
transfer (ET), $ii)$ one-way ET from the source (S) to the relay (R), and
$iii)$ two-way ET. We consider the problem of optimal power allocation in
NC-EH-$\mathcal{RC}$ in order to maximize the total transmitted bits from S to
the destination in a given time duration. General stochastic energy arrivals at
S and R with known EH times and values are assumed. In NC-EH-$\mathcal{RC}$
with no ET, the complicated min-max optimization form along with its
constraints make the problem intractable. It is shown that this problem can be
transformed to a solvable convex form; however, convex optimization solution
does not provide the structural properties of the optimal solution. Therefore,
following an alternative perspective, we investigate conditions on harvesting
process of S and R where we find optimal algorithmic solution. Further, we
propose some suboptimal algorithms and provide some examples, in which the
algorithms are optimal. Moreover, we find a class of problems for
NC-EH-$\mathcal{RC}$ with one-way ET from S to R, where the optimal algorithmic
solution is devised. For NC-EH-$\mathcal{RC}$ with two-way ET, we propose
\emph{general} optimal algorithmic solution. Furthermore, the performance of
the proposed algorithms are evaluated numerically and compared with optimal
numerical convex optimization tools.
"
412,"Neuromimetic Circuits with Synaptic Devices based on Strongly Correlated
  Electron Systems","  Strongly correlated electron systems such as the rare-earth nickelates
(RNiO3, R = rare-earth element) can exhibit synapse-like continuous long term
potentiation and depression when gated with ionic liquids; exploiting the
extreme sensitivity of coupled charge, spin, orbital, and lattice degrees of
freedom to stoichiometry. We present experimental real-time, device-level
classical conditioning and unlearning using nickelate-based synaptic devices in
an electronic circuit compatible with both excitatory and inhibitory neurons.
We establish a physical model for the device behavior based on electric-field
driven coupled ionic-electronic diffusion that can be utilized for design of
more complex systems. We use the model to simulate a variety of associate and
non-associative learning mechanisms, as well as a feedforward recurrent network
for storing memory. Our circuit intuitively parallels biological neural
architectures, and it can be readily generalized to other forms of cellular
learning and extinction. The simulation of neural function with electronic
device analogues may provide insight into biological processes such as decision
making, learning and adaptation, while facilitating advanced parallel
information processing in hardware.
"
413,Social Behavior in Bacterial Nanonetworks: Challenges and Opportunities,"  Molecular communication promises to enable communication between nanomachines
with a view to increasing their functionalities and open up new possible
applications. Due to some of the biological properties, bacteria have been
proposed as a possible information carrier for molecular communication, and the
corresponding communication networks are known as \textit{bacterial
nanonetworks}. The biological properties include the ability for bacteria to
mobilize between locations and carry the information encoded in
Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) molecules. However, similar to most organisms,
bacteria have complex social properties that govern their colony. These social
characteristics enable the bacteria to evolve through various fluctuating
environmental conditions by utilizing cooperative and non-cooperative
behaviors. This article provides an overview of the different types of
cooperative and non-cooperative social behavior of bacteria. The challenges
(due to non-cooperation) and the opportunities (due to cooperation) these
behaviors can bring to the reliability of communication in bacterial
nanonetworks are also discussed. Finally, simulation results on the impact of
bacterial cooperative social behavior on the end-to-end reliability of a
single-link bacterial nanonetwork are presented. The article concludes with
highlighting the potential future research opportunities in this emerging
field.
"
414,"Memcomputing NP-complete problems in polynomial time using polynomial
  resources and collective states","  Memcomputing is a novel non-Turing paradigm of computation that uses
interacting memory cells (memprocessors for short) to store and process
information on the same physical platform. It was recently proved
mathematically that memcomputing machines have the same computational power of
non-deterministic Turing machines. Therefore, they can solve NP-complete
problems in polynomial time and, using the appropriate architecture, with
resources that only grow polynomially with the input size. The reason for this
computational power stems from properties inspired by the brain and shared by
any universal memcomputing machine, in particular intrinsic parallelism and
information overhead, namely the capability of compressing information in the
collective state of the memprocessor network. Here, we show an experimental
demonstration of an actual memcomputing architecture that solves the
NP-complete version of the subset-sum problem in only one step and is composed
of a number of memprocessors that scales linearly with the size of the problem.
We have fabricated this architecture using standard microelectronic technology
so that it can be easily realized in any laboratory setting. Even though the
particular machine presented here is eventually limited by noise--and will thus
require error-correcting codes to scale to an arbitrary number of
memprocessors--it represents the first proof-of-concept of a machine capable of
working with the collective state of interacting memory cells, unlike the
present-day single-state machines built using the von Neumann architecture.
"
415,Can we build a conscious machine?,"  The underlying physiological mechanisms of generating conscious states are
still unknown. To make progress on the problem of consciousness, we will need
to experimentally design a system that evolves in a similar way our brains do.
Recent experimental data show that the multiscale nature of the evolving human
brain can be implemented by reprogramming human cells. A hybrid system can be
designed to include an evolving brain equipped with digital computers that
maintain homeostasis and provide the right amount of nutrients and oxygen for
the brain growth. Shaping the structure of the evolving brain will be
progressively achieved by controlling spatial organization of various types of
cells. Following a specific program, the evolving brain can be trained using
substitutional reality to learn and experience live scenes. We already know
from neuroelectrodynamics that meaningful information in the brain is
electrically (wirelessly) read out and written fast in neurons and synapses at
the molecular (protein) level during the generation of action potentials and
synaptic activities. Since with training, meaningful information accumulates
and is electrically integrated in the brain, one can predict, that this gradual
process of training will trigger a tipping point for conscious experience to
emerge in the hybrid system.
"
416,"Threshold Logic Computing: Memristive-CMOS Circuits for Fast Fourier
  Transform and Vedic Multiplication","  Brain inspired circuits can provide an alternative solution to implement
computing architectures taking advantage of fault tolerance and generalisation
ability of logic gates. In this brief, we advance over the memristive threshold
circuit configuration consisting of memristive averaging circuit in combination
with operational amplifier and/or CMOS inverters in application to realizing
complex computing circuits. The developed memristive threshold logic gates are
used for designing FFT and multiplication circuits useful for modern
microprocessors. Overall, the proposed threshold logic outperforms previous
memristive-CMOS logic cells on every aspect, however, indicate a lower chip
area, lower THD, and controllable leakage power, but a higher power dissipation
with respect to CMOS logic.
"
417,"Liquid State Machine with Dendritically Enhanced Readout for Low-power,
  Neuromorphic VLSI Implementations","  In this paper, we describe a new neuro-inspired, hardware-friendly readout
stage for the liquid state machine (LSM), a popular model for reservoir
computing. Compared to the parallel perceptron architecture trained by the
p-delta algorithm, which is the state of the art in terms of performance of
readout stages, our readout architecture and learning algorithm can attain
better performance with significantly less synaptic resources making it
attractive for VLSI implementation. Inspired by the nonlinear properties of
dendrites in biological neurons, our readout stage incorporates neurons having
multiple dendrites with a lumped nonlinearity. The number of synaptic
connections on each branch is significantly lower than the total number of
connections from the liquid neurons and the learning algorithm tries to find
the best 'combination' of input connections on each branch to reduce the error.
Hence, the learning involves network rewiring (NRW) of the readout network
similar to structural plasticity observed in its biological counterparts. We
show that compared to a single perceptron using analog weights, this
architecture for the readout can attain, even by using the same number of
binary valued synapses, up to 3.3 times less error for a two-class spike train
classification problem and 2.4 times less error for an input rate approximation
task. Even with 60 times larger synapses, a group of 60 parallel perceptrons
cannot attain the performance of the proposed dendritically enhanced readout.
An additional advantage of this method for hardware implementations is that the
'choice' of connectivity can be easily implemented exploiting address event
representation (AER) protocols commonly used in current neuromorphic systems
where the connection matrix is stored in memory. Also, due to the use of binary
synapses, our proposed method is more robust against statistical variations.

418,"Effect of Receptor Density and Size on Signal Reception in Molecular
  Communication via Diffusion with an Absorbing Receiver","  The performance of molecular communication is significantly impacted by the
reception process of the messenger molecules. The receptors' size and density,
however, have yet to be investigated. In this letter, we analyze the effect of
receptor density and size on the signal reception of an absorbing receiver with
receptors. The results show that, when the total receptor area is the same,
better hitting probability is achieved by using a higher number of relatively
small receptors. In addition, deploying receptors, which cover a small
percentage of the receiver surface, is able to create an effective
communication channel that has a detectable signal level.

funded by the Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) by the European Commission
within CORDIS and the FET Proactive scheme. Included in this presentation are
details the development of a Physarum based biosensor and biological logic
gate, offering significant advancements in the respective fields. The work
demonstrates the first steps towards Physarum computation and practical
Physarum Biosensor; subsequent work will focus on development of a hybrid

"
420,"Training and Operation of an Integrated Neuromorphic Network Based on
  Metal-Oxide Memristors","  Despite all the progress of semiconductor integrated circuit technology, the
extreme complexity of the human cerebral cortex makes the hardware
implementation of neuromorphic networks with a comparable number of devices
exceptionally challenging. One of the most prospective candidates to provide
comparable complexity, while operating much faster and with manageable power
dissipation, are so-called CrossNets based on hybrid CMOS/memristor circuits.
In these circuits, the usual CMOS stack is augmented with one or several
crossbar layers, with adjustable two-terminal memristors at each crosspoint.
Recently, there was a significant progress in improvement of technology of
fabrication of such memristive crossbars and their integration with CMOS
circuits, including first demonstrations of their vertical integration.
Separately, there have been several demonstrations of discrete memristors as
artificial synapses for neuromorphic networks. Very recently such experiments
were extended to crossbar arrays of phase-change memristive devices. The
adjustment of such devices, however, requires an additional transistor at each
crosspoint, and hence the prospects of their scaling are less impressive than
those of metal-oxide memristors, whose nonlinear I-V curves enable
transistor-free operation. Here we report the first experimental implementation
of a transistor-free metal-oxide memristor crossbar with device variability
lowered sufficiently to demonstrate a successful operation of a simple
integrated neural network, a single layer-perceptron. The network could be
taught in situ using a coarse-grain variety of the delta-rule algorithm to
perform the perfect classification of 3x3-pixel black/white images into 3
classes. We believe that this demonstration is an important step towards the
implementation of much larger and more complex memristive neuromorphic
networks.
"
421,Quipper: Concrete Resource Estimation in Quantum Algorithms,"  Despite the rich literature on quantum algorithms, there is a surprisingly
small amount of coverage of their concrete logical design and implementation.
Most resource estimation is done at the level of complexity analysis, but
actual concrete numbers (of quantum gates, qubits, etc.) can differ by orders
of magnitude. The line of work we present here is a formal framework to write,
and reason about, quantum algorithms. Specifically, we designed a language,
Quipper, with scalability in mind, and we are able to report actual resource
counts for seven non-trivial algorithms found in the quantum computer science
literature.

422,"A review of ""Mem-computing NP-complete problems in polynomial time using
  polynomial resources"" (arXiv:1411.4798)","  The reviewed paper describes an analog device that empirically solves small
instances of the NP-complete Subset Sum Problem (SSP). The authors claim that
this device can solve the SSP in polynomial time using polynomial space, in
principle, and observe no exponential scaling in resource requirements. We
point out that (a) the properties ascribed by the authors to their device are
insufficient to solve NP-complete problems in poly-time, (b) runtime analysis
offered does not cover the spectral measurement step, (c) the overall technique
requires exponentially increasing resources when scaled up because of the
spectral measurement step.
"
423,"On Gate Complexity of Reversible Circuits Consisting of NOT, CNOT and
  2-CNOT Gates","  The paper discusses the gate complexity of reversible circuits consisting of
NOT, CNOT and 2-CNOT gates. The Shannon gate complexity function $L(n, q)$ for
a reversible circuit, implementing a Boolean transformation $f\colon \mathbb
Z_2^n \to \mathbb Z_2^n$, is defined as a function of $n$ and the number of
additional inputs $q$. The general lower bound $L(n,q) \geq
\frac{2^n(n-2)}{3\log_2(n+q)} - \frac{n}{3}$ for the gate complexity of a
reversible circuit is proved. An upper bound $L(n,0) \leqslant
3n2^{n+4}(1+o(1)) \mathop / \log_2n$ for the gate complexity of a reversible
circuit without additional inputs is proved. An upper bound $L(n,q_0) \lesssim
2^n$ for the gate complexity of a reversible circuit with $q_0 \sim
n2^{n-o(n)}$ additional inputs is proved.

424,"A Biological-Realtime Neuromorphic System in 28 nm CMOS using
  Low-Leakage Switched Capacitor Circuits","  A switched-capacitor (SC) neuromorphic system for closed-loop neural coupling
in 28 nm CMOS is presented, occupying 600 um by 600 um. It offers 128 input
channels (i.e. presynaptic terminals), 8192 synapses and 64 output channels
(i.e. neurons). Biologically realistic neuron and synapse dynam- ics are
achieved via a faithful translation of the behavioural equations to SC
circuits. As leakage currents significantly affect circuit behaviour at this
technology node, dedicated compensation techniques are employed to achieve
biological-realtime operation, with faithful reproduction of time constants of
several 100 ms at room temperature. Power draw of the overall system is 1.9 mW.
"
425,"Switched-Capacitor Realization of Presynaptic Short-Term-Plasticity and
  Stop-Learning Synapses in 28 nm CMOS","  Synaptic dynamics, such as long- and short-term plasticity, play an important
role in the complexity and biological realism achievable when running neural
networks on a neuromorphic IC. For example, they endow the IC with an ability
to adapt and learn from its environment. In order to achieve the mil- lisecond
to second time constants required for these synaptic dynamics, analog
subthreshold circuits are usually employed. However, due to process variation
and leakage problems, it is almost impossible to port these types of circuits
to modern sub-100nm technologies. In contrast, we present a neuromor- phic
system in a 28 nm CMOS process that employs switched capacitor (SC) circuits to
implement 128 short term plasticity presynapses as well as 8192 stop-learning
synapses. The neuromorphic system consumes an area of 0.36 mm2 and runs at a
power consumption of 1.9 mW. The circuit makes use of a technique for
minimizing leakage effects allowing for real-time operation with time constants
up to sev- eral seconds. Since we rely on SC techniques for all calculations,
the system is composed of only generic mixed-signal building blocks. These
generic building blocks make the system easy to port between technologies and
the large digital circuit part inherent in an SC system benefits fully from
technology scaling.
"
426,Multi-Scale Stochastic Simulation for Diffusive Molecular Communication,"  Recently, hybrid models have emerged that combine microscopic and mesoscopic
regimes in a single stochastic reaction-diffusion simulation. Microscopic
simulations track every individual molecule and are generally more accurate.
Mesoscopic simulations partition the environment into subvolumes, track when
molecules move between adjacent subvolumes, and are generally more
computationally efficient. In this paper, we present the foundation of a
multi-scale stochastic simulator from the perspective of molecular
communication, for both mesoscopic and hybrid models, where we emphasize
simulation accuracy at the receiver and efficiency in regions that are far from
the communication link. Our multi-scale models use subvolumes of different
sizes, between which we derive the diffusion event transition rate. Simulation
results compare the accuracy and efficiency of traditional approaches with that
of a regular hybrid method and with those of our proposed multi-scale methods.
"
427,Nano-artifact metrics based on random collapse of resist,"  Artifact metrics is an information security technology that uses the
intrinsic characteristics of a physical object for authentication and clone
resistance. Here, we demonstrate nano-artifact metrics based on silicon
nanostructures formed via an array of resist pillars that randomly collapse
when exposed to electron-beam lithography. The proposed technique uses
conventional and scalable lithography processes, and because of the random
collapse of resist, the resultant structure has extremely fine-scale morphology
with a minimum dimension below 10 nm, which is less than the resolution of
current lithography capabilities. By evaluating false match, false non-match
and clone-resistance rates, we clarify that the nanostructured patterns based
on resist collapse satisfy the requirements for high-performance security
applications.
"
428,Spin-Orbit Torque Induced Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity,"  Nanoelectronic devices that mimic the functionality of synapses are a crucial
requirement for performing cortical simulations of the brain. In this work we
propose a ferromagnet-heavy metal heterostructure that employs spin-orbit
torque to implement Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity. The proposed device
offers the advantage of decoupled spike transmission and programming current
paths, thereby leading to reliable operation during online learning. Possible
arrangement of such devices in a crosspoint architecture can pave the way for
ultra-dense neural networks. Simulation studies indicate that the device has
the potential of achieving pico-Joule level energy consumption (maximum 2 pJ
per synaptic event) which is comparable to the energy consumption for synaptic
events in biological synapses.
"
429,Search Methods for Tile Sets in Patterned DNA Self-Assembly,"  The Pattern self-Assembly Tile set Synthesis (PATS) problem, which arises in
the theory of structured DNA self-assembly, is to determine a set of coloured
tiles that, starting from a bordering seed structure, self-assembles to a given
rectangular colour pattern. The task of finding minimum-size tile sets is known
to be NP-hard. We explore several complete and incomplete search techniques for
finding minimal, or at least small, tile sets and also assess the reliability
of the solutions obtained according to the kinetic Tile Assembly Model.

430,"Carbon Nanotube Based Delay Model For High Speed Energy Efficient on
  Chip Data Transmission Using: Current Mode Technique","  Speed is a major concern for high density VLSI networks. In this paper the
closed form delay model for current mode signalling in VLSI interconnects has
been proposed with resistive load termination. RLC interconnect line is
modelled using characteristic impedance of transmission line and inductive
effect. The inductive effect is dominant at lower technology node is modelled
into an equivalent resistance. In this model first order transfer function is
designed using finite difference equation, and by applying the boundary
conditions at the source and load termination. It has been observed that the
dominant pole determines system response and delay in the proposed model. Using
CNIA tool (carbon nanotube interconnect analyzer) the interconnect line
parameters has been estimated at 45nm technology node. The novel proposed
current mode model superiority has been validated for CNT type of material. It
superiority factor remains to 66.66% as compared to voltage mode signalling.
And current mode dissipates 0.015pJ energy where as VM consume 0.045pJ for a
single bit transmission across the interconnect over CNT material. Secondly the
damping factor of a lumped RLC circuit is shown to be a useful figure of merit.
"
431,"Minimizing the Latency of Quantum Circuits during Mapping to the
  Ion-Trap Circuit Fabric","  Quantum computers are exponentially faster than their classical counterparts
in terms of solving some specific, but important problems. The biggest
challenge in realizing a quantum computing system is the environmental noise.
One way to decrease the effect of noise (and hence, reduce the overhead of
building fault tolerant quantum circuits) is to reduce the latency of the
quantum circuit that runs on a quantum circuit. In this paper, a novel
algorithm is presented for scheduling, placement, and routing of a quantum
algorithm, which is to be realized on a target quantum circuit fabric
technology. This algorithm, and the accompanying software tool, advances
state-of-the-art in quantum CAD methodologies and methods while considering key
characteristics and constraints of the ion-trap quantum circuit fabric.
Experimental results show that the presented tool improves results of the
previous tool by about 41%.
"
432,Squash: A Scalable Quantum Mapper Considering Ancilla Sharing,"  Quantum algorithms for solving problems of interesting size often result in
circuits with a very large number of qubits and quantum gates. Fortunately,
these algorithms also tend to contain a small number of repetitively-used
quantum kernels. Identifying the quantum logic blocks that implement such
quantum kernels is critical to the complexity management for realizing the
corresponding quantum circuit. Moreover, quantum computation requires some type
of quantum error correction coding to combat decoherence, which in turn results
in a large number of ancilla qubits in the circuit. Sharing the ancilla qubits
among quantum operations (even though this sharing can increase the overall
circuit latency) is important in order to curb the resource demand of the
quantum algorithm. This paper presents a multi-core reconfigurable quantum
processor architecture, called Requp, which supports a layered approach to
mapping a quantum algorithm and ancilla sharing. More precisely, a scalable
quantum mapper, called Squash, is introduced, which divides a given quantum
circuit into a number of quantum kernels- each kernel comprises k parts such
that each part will run on exactly one of k available cores. Experimental
results demonstrate that Squash can handle large-scale quantum algorithms while
providing an effective mechanism for sharing ancilla qubits.
"
433,QPEL: Quantum Program and Effect Language,"  We present the syntax and rules of deduction of QPEL (Quantum Program and
Effect Language), a language for describing both quantum programs, and
properties of quantum programs - effects on the appropriate Hilbert space. We
show how semantics may be given in terms of state-and-effect triangles, a
categorical setting that allows semantics in terms of Hilbert spaces,
C*-algebras, and other categories. We prove soundness and completeness results
that show the derivable judgements are exactly those provable in all
state-and-effect triangles.

434,"Maze Solving Automatons for Self-Healing of Open Interconnects: Modular
  Add-on for Circuit Boards","  We present the circuit board integration of a self-healing mechanism to
repair open faults. The electric field driven mechanism physically restores
fractured interconnects in electronic circuits and has the ability to solve
mazes. The repair is performed by conductive particles dispersed in an
insulating fluid. We demonstrate the integration of the healing module onto
printed circuit boards and the ability of maze solving. We model and perform
experiments on the influence of the geometry of the conductive particles as
well as the terminal impedances of the route on the healing efficiency. The
typical heal rate is 10 $\mu$m/s with healed route having resistance of 100
$\Omega$ to 20 k$\Omega$ depending on the materials and concentrations used.
"
435,"STT-SNN: A Spin-Transfer-Torque Based Soft-Limiting Non-Linear Neuron
  for Low-Power Artificial Neural Networks","  Recent years have witnessed growing interest in the use of Artificial Neural
Networks (ANNs) for vision, classification, and inference problems. An
artificial neuron sums N weighted inputs and passes the result through a
non-linear transfer function. Large-scale ANNs impose very high computing
requirements for training and classification, leading to great interest in the
use of post-CMOS devices to realize them in an energy efficient manner. In this
paper, we propose a spin-transfer-torque (STT) device based on Domain Wall
Motion (DWM) magnetic strip that can efficiently implement a Soft-limiting
Non-linear Neuron (SNN) operating at ultra-low supply voltage and current. In
contrast to previous spin-based neurons that can only realize hard-limiting
transfer functions, the proposed STT-SNN displays a continuous resistance
change with varying input current, and can therefore be employed to implement a
soft-limiting neuron transfer function. Soft-limiting neurons are greatly
preferred to hard-limiting ones due to their much improved modeling capacity,
which leads to higher network accuracy and lower network complexity. We also
present an ANN hardware design employing the proposed STT-SNNs and Memristor
Crossbar Arrays (MCA) as synapses. The ultra-low voltage operation of the
magneto metallic STT-SNN enables the programmable MCA-synapses, computing
analog-domain weighted summation of input voltages, to also operate at
ultra-low voltage. We modeled the STT-SNN using micro-magnetic simulation and
evaluated them using an ANN for character recognition. Comparisons with analog
and digital CMOS neurons show that STT-SNNs can achieve more than two orders of
magnitude lower energy consumption.

436,"Optimized Implementation of Memristor-Based Full Adder by Material
  Implication Logic","  Recently memristor-based applications and circuits are receiving an increased
attention. Furthermore, memristors are also applied in logic circuit design.
Material implication logic is one of the main areas with memristors. In this
paper an optimized memristor-based full adder design by material implication
logic is presented. This design needs 27 memristors and less area in comparison
with typical CMOS-based 8-bit full adders. Also the presented full adder needs
only 184 computational steps which enhance former full adder design speed by 20
percent.
"
437,"LEQA: Latency Estimation for a Quantum Algorithm Mapped to a Quantum
  Circuit Fabric","  This paper presents LEQA, a fast latency estimation tool for evaluating the
performance of a quantum algorithm mapped to a quantum fabric. The actual
quantum algorithm latency can be computed by performing detailed scheduling,
placement and routing of the quantum instructions and qubits in a quantum
operation dependency graph on a quantum circuit fabric. This is, however, a
very expensive proposition that requires large amounts of processing time.
Instead, LEQA, which is based on computing the neighborhood population counts
of qubits, can produce estimates of the circuit latency with good accuracy
(i.e., an average of less than 3% error) with up to two orders of magnitude
speedup for mid-size benchmarks. This speedup is expected to increase
superlinearly as a function of circuit size (operation count).
"
438,"Design of a Universal Logic Block for Fault-Tolerant Realization of any
  Logic Operation in Trapped-Ion Quantum Circuits","  This paper presents a physical mapping tool for quantum circuits, which
generates the optimal Universal Logic Block (ULB) that can perform any logical
fault-tolerant (FT) quantum operations with the minimum latency. The operation
scheduling, placement, and qubit routing problems tackled by the quantum
physical mapper are highly dependent on one another. More precisely, the
scheduling solution affects the quality of the achievable placement solution
due to resource pressures that may be created as a result of operation
scheduling whereas the operation placement and qubit routing solutions
influence the scheduling solution due to resulting distances between
predecessor and current operations, which in turn determines routing latencies.
The proposed flow for the quantum physical mapper captures these dependencies
by applying (i) a loose scheduling step, which transforms an initial quantum
data flow graph into one that explicitly captures the no-cloning theorem of the
quantum computing and then performs instruction scheduling based on a modified
force-directed scheduling approach to minimize the resource contention and
quantum circuit latency, (ii) a placement step, which uses timing-driven
instruction placement to minimize the approximate routing latencies while
making iterative calls to the aforesaid force-directed scheduler to correct
scheduling levels of quantum operations as needed, and (iii) a routing step
that finds dynamic values of routing latencies for the qubits. In addition to
the quantum physical mapper, an approach is presented to determine the single
best ULB size for a target quantum circuit by examining the latency of
different FT quantum operations mapped onto different ULB sizes and using
information about the occurrence frequency of operations on critical paths of
the target quantum algorithm to weigh these latencies.

439,"High performance photonic reservoir computer based on a coherently
  driven passive cavity","  Reservoir computing is a recent bio-inspired approach for processing
time-dependent signals. It has enabled a breakthrough in analog information
processing, with several experiments, both electronic and optical,
demonstrating state-of-the-art performances for hard tasks such as speech
recognition, time series prediction and nonlinear channel equalization. A
proof-of-principle experiment using a linear optical circuit on a photonic chip
to process digital signals was recently reported. Here we present a photonic
implementation of a reservoir computer based on a coherently driven passive
fiber cavity processing analog signals. Our experiment has error rate as low or
lower than previous experiments on a wide variety of tasks, and also has lower
power consumption. Furthermore, the analytical model describing our experiment
is also of interest, as it constitutes a very simple high performance reservoir
computer algorithm. The present experiment, given its good performances, low
energy consumption and conceptual simplicity, confirms the great potential of
photonic reservoir computing for information processing applications ranging
from artificial intelligence to telecommunications

440,"Asymptotic bounds of depth for a reversible circuit consisting of NOT,
  CNOT and 2-CNOT gates","  The paper discusses the asymptotic depth of a reversible circuit consisting
of NOT, CNOT and 2-CNOT gates. Reversible circuit depth function $D(n, q)$ for
a circuit implementing a transformation $f\colon \mathbb Z_2^n \to \mathbb
Z_2^n$ is introduced as a function of $n$ and the number of additional inputs
$q$. It is proved that for the case of implementing a permutation from
$A(\mathbb Z_2^n)$ with a reversible circuit having no additional inputs the
depth is bounded as $D(n, 0) \gtrsim 2^n / (3\log_2 n)$. It is proved that for
the case of implementing a transformation $f\colon \mathbb Z_2^n \to \mathbb
Z_2^n$ with a reversible circuit having $q_0 \sim 2^n$ additional inputs the
depth is bounded as $D(n, q_0) \lesssim 3n$.

441,60 GHz MAC Standardization: Progress and Way Forward,"  Communication at mmWave frequencies has been the focus in the recent years.
In this paper, we discuss standardization efforts in 60 GHz short range
communication and the progress therein. We compare the available standards in
terms of network architecture, medium access control mechanisms, physical layer
techniques and several other features. Comparative analysis indicates that IEEE
802.11ad is likely to lead the short-range indoor communication at 60 GHz. We
bring to the fore resolved and unresolved issues pertaining to robust WLAN
connectivity at 60 GHz. Further, we discuss the role of mmWave bands in 5G
communication scenarios and highlight the further efforts required in terms of
research and standardization.

442,"A 0.042 mm^2 programmable biphasic stimulator for cochlear implants
  suitable for a large number of channels","  This paper presents a compact programmable biphasic stimulator for cochlear
implants. By employing double-loop negative feedback, the output impedance of
the current generator is increased, while maximizing the voltage compliance of
the output transistor. To make the stimulator circuit compact, the stimulation
current is set by scaling a reference current using a two stage binary-weighted
transistor DAC (comprising a 3 bit high-voltage transistor DAC and a 4 bit
low-voltage transistor DAC). With this structure the power consumption and the
area of the circuit can be minimized. The proposed circuit has been implemented
in AMS 0.18um high-voltage CMOS IC technology, using an active chip area of
about 0.042mm^2. Measurement results show that proper charge balance of the
anodic and cathodic stimulation phases is achieved and a dc blocking capacitor
can be omitted. The resulting reduction in the required area makes the proposed
system suitable for a large number of channels.
"
443,Computing Real Numbers using DNA Self-Assembly,"  DNA Self-Assembly has emerged as an interdisciplinary field with many
intriguing applications such DNA bio-sensor, DNA circuits, DNA storage, drug
delivery etc. Tile assembly model of DNA has been studied for various
computational primitives such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and
division. Xuncai et. al. gave computational DNA tiles to perform division of a
number but the output had integer quotient. In this work, we simply modify
their method of division to improve its compatibility with further computation
and this modification has found its application in computing rational numbers,
both recurring and terminating, with computational tile complexity of
$\mathcal{O} (1)$ and $\mathcal{O} (h)$ respectively. Additionally, we also
propose a method to compute square-root of a number with computational tile
complexity of $\mathcal{O} (n)$ for an n bit number. Finally, after combining
tiles of division and square-root, we propose a simple way to compute the
ubiquitously used irrational number, $\pi$, using its infinite series.
"
444,Self-Inverse Functions and Palindromic Circuits,"  We investigate the subclass of reversible functions that are self-inverse and
relate them to reversible circuits that are equal to their reverse circuit,
which are called palindromic circuits. We precisely determine which
self-inverse functions can be realized as a palindromic circuit. For those
functions that cannot be realized as a palindromic circuit, we find alternative
palindromic representations that require an extra circuit line or quantum gates
in their construction. Our analyses make use of involutions in the symmetric
group $S_{2^n}$ which are isomorphic to self-inverse reversible function on $n$
variables.
"
445,Accuracy Enhancement of Pickett Tunnelling Barrier Memristor Model,"  Titanium dioxide (TiO2) memristors exhibit complex conduction mechanism.
Several models of different complexity have been developed in order to mimic
the experimental results for physical behaviors observed in memristor devices.
Pickett's tunneling barrier model describes the TiO2 memristors, and utilizes
complex derivative of tunnel barrier width. It attains a large error in the ON
switching region. Variety of research consider it as the reference model for
the TiO2 memristors. In this paper, we first analyze the theory of operation of
the memristor and discuss Pickett's model. Then, we propose a modification to
its derivative functions to provide a lower error and closer agreement with
physical behavior. This modification is represented by two additional fitting
parameters to damp or accelerate the tunnel width derivative. Also, we
incorporate a hard limiter term to limit the tunnel width to its physical
extremes 1 nm and 2 nm. We run simulations to test the model modifications and
we compare the results to the experimental and original Pickett's model
results. The modified model more closely resembles the experimental behavior of
TiO2 memristors and potentially enables the memristor to be used as a
multilevel memory.
"
446,Multiple State EFN Transistors,"  Electrostatically Formed Nanowire (EFN) based transistors have been suggested
in the past as gas sensing devices. These transistors are multiple gate
transistors in which the source to drain conduction path is determined by the
bias applied to the back gate, and two junction gates. If a specific bias is
applied to the side gates, the conduction band electrons between them are
confined to a well-defined area forming a narrow channel- the Electrostatically
Formed Nanowire. Recent work has shown that by applying non-symmetric bias on
the side gates, the lateral position of the EFN can be controlled. We propose a
novel Multiple State EFN Transistor (MSET) that utilizes this degree of freedom
for the implementation of complete multiplexer functionality in a single
transistor like device. The multiplexer functionality allows a very simple
implementation of binary and multiple valued logic functions.
"
447,Concept for a CMOS Image Sensor Suited for Analog Image Pre-Processing,"  A concept for a novel CMOS image sensor suited for analog image
pre-processing is presented in this paper. As an example, an image restoration
algorithm for reducing image noise is applied as image pre-processing in the
analog domain. To supply low-latency data input for analog image preprocessing,
the proposed concept for a CMOS image sensor offers a new sensor signal
acquisition method in 2D. In comparison to image pre-processing in the digital
domain, the proposed analog image pre-processing promises an improved image
quality. Furthermore, the image noise at the stage of analog sensor signal
acquisition can be used to select the most effective restoration algorithm
applied to the analog circuit due to image processing prior to the A/D
converter.
"
448,"Connectionist-Symbolic Machine Intelligence using Cellular Automata
  based Reservoir-Hyperdimensional Computing","  We introduce a novel framework of reservoir computing, that is capable of
both connectionist machine intelligence and symbolic computation. Cellular
automaton is used as the reservoir of dynamical systems. Input is randomly
projected onto the initial conditions of automaton cells and nonlinear
computation is performed on the input via application of a rule in the
automaton for a period of time. The evolution of the automaton creates a
space-time volume of the automaton state space, and it is used as the
reservoir. The proposed framework is capable of long short-term memory and it
requires orders of magnitude less computation compared to Echo State Networks.
We prove that cellular automaton reservoir holds a distributed representation
of attribute statistics, which provides a more effective computation than local
representation. It is possible to estimate the kernel for linear cellular
automata via metric learning, that enables a much more efficient distance
computation in support vector machine framework. Also, binary reservoir feature
vectors can be combined using Boolean operations as in hyperdimensional
computing, paving a direct way for concept building and symbolic processing.
"
449,"Replication of arbitrary hole-free shapes via self-assembly with
  signal-passing tiles (extended abstract)","  In this paper, we investigate the abilities of systems of self-assembling
tiles which can each pass a constant number of signals to their immediate
neighbors to create replicas of input shapes. Namely, we work within the
Signal-passing Tile Assembly Model (STAM), and we provide a universal STAM tile
set which is capable of creating unbounded numbers of assemblies of shapes
identical to those of input assemblies. The shapes of the input assemblies can
be arbitrary 2-dimensional hole-free shapes at scale factor 2. This greatly
improves previous shape replication results in self-assembly that required
models in which multiple assembly stages and/or bins were required, and the
shapes which could be replicated were quite constrained.
"
450,"A Universal Channel Model for Molecular Communication Systems with
  Metal-Oxide Detectors","  In this paper, we propose an end-to-end channel model for molecular
communication systems with metal-oxide sensors. In particular, we focus on the
recently developed table top molecular communication platform. The system is
separated into two parts: the propagation and the sensor detection. There is
derived, based on this, a more realistic end-to-end channel model. However,
since some of the coefficients in the derived models are unknown, we collect a
great deal of experimental data to estimate these coefficients and evaluate how
they change with respect to the different system parameters. Finally, a noise
model is derived for the system to complete an end-to-end system model for the
tabletop platform.
"
451,"On the role of the plasmodial cytoskeleton in facilitating intelligent
  behaviour in slime mould Physarum polycephalum","  The plasmodium of slime mould Physarum polycephalum behaves as an amorphous
reaction-diffusion computing substrate and is capable of apparently intelligent
behaviour. But how does intelligence emerge in an acellular organism? Through a
range of laboratory experiments, we visualise the plasmodial cytoskeleton, a
ubiquitous cellular protein scaffold whose functions are manifold and essential
to life, and discuss its putative role as a network for transducing,
transmitting and structuring data streams within the plasmodium. Through a
range of computer modelling techniques, we demonstrate how emergent behaviour,
and hence computational intelligence, may occur in cytoskeletal communications
networks. Specifically, we model the topology of both the actin and tubulin
cytoskeletal networks and discuss how computation may occur therein.
Furthermore, we present bespoke cellular automata and particle swarm models for
the computational process within the cytoskeleton and observe the incidence of
emergent patterns in both. Our work grants unique insight into the origins of
natural intelligence; the results presented here are therefore readily
transferable to the fields of natural computation, cell biology and biomedical
science. We conclude by discussing how our results may alter our biological,
computational and philosophical understanding of intelligence and
consciousness.
"
452,"Approximation of Statistical Analysis and Estimation by Morphological
  Adaptation in a Model of Slime Mould","  True slime mould Physarum polycephalum approximates a range of complex
computations via growth and adaptation of its proto- plasmic transport network,
stimulating a large body of recent research into how such a simple organism can
perform such complex feats. The properties of networks constructed by slime
mould are known to be in- fluenced by the local distribution of stimuli within
its environment. But can the morphological adaptation of slime mould yield any
information about the global statistical properties of its environment? We
explore this possibility using a particle based model of slime mould. We
demonstrate how morphological adaptation in blobs of virtual slime mould may be
used as a simple computational mechanism that can coarsely approx- imate
statistical analysis, estimation and tracking. Preliminary results include the
approximation of the geometric centroid of 2D shapes, ap- proximation of
arithmetic mean from spatially represented sorted and unsorted data
distributions, and the estimation and dynamical tracking of moving object
position in the presence of noise contaminated input stimuli. The results
suggest that it is possible to utilise collectives of very simple components
with limited individual computational ability (for ex- ample swarms of simple
robotic devices) to extract statistical features from complex datasets by means
of material adaptation and sensorial fusion.
"
453,"Material Approximation of Data Smoothing and Spline Curves Inspired by
  Slime Mould","  Using a particle model of Physarum displaying emer- gent morphological
adaptation behaviour we demonstrate how a minimal approach to collective
material computation may be used to transform and summarise properties of
spatially represented datasets. We find that the virtual material relaxes more
strongly to high-frequency changes in data which can be used for the smoothing
(or filtering) of data by ap- proximating moving average and low-pass filters
in 1D datasets. The relaxation and minimisation properties of the model enable
the spatial computation of B-spline curves (approximating splines) in 2D
datasets. Both clamped and unclamped spline curves, of open and closed shapes,
can be represented and the degree of spline curvature corresponds to the
relaxation time of the material. The material computation of spline curves also
includes novel quasi-mechanical properties including unwind- ing of the shape
between control points and a preferential adhesion to longer, straighter paths.
Interpolating splines could not directly be ap- proximated due to the formation
and evolution of Steiner points at nar- row vertices, but were approximated
after rectilinear pre-processing of the source data. This pre-processing was
further simplified by transform- ing the original data to contain the material
inside the polyline. These exemplar results expand the repertoire of spatially
represented uncon- ventional computing devices by demonstrating a simple,
collective and distributed approach to data and curve smoothing.
"
454,"A Morphological Adaptation Approach to Path Planning Inspired by Slime
  Mould","  Using a particle model of slime mould we demonstrate scoping experiments
which explore how path planning may be performed by morphological adaptation.
We initially demonstrate simple path planning by a shrinking blob of virtual
plasmodium between two attractant sources within a polygonal arena. We examine
the case where multiple paths are required and the subsequent selection of a
single path from multiple options. Collision-free paths are implemented via
repulsion from the borders of the arena. Finally, obstacle avoidance is
implemented by repulsion from obstacles as they are uncovered by the shrinking
blob. These examples show proof-of-concept results of path planning by
morphological adaptation which complement existing research on path planning in
novel computing substrates.
"
455,Detection Algorithms for Molecular MIMO,"  In this paper, we propose a novel design for molecular communication in which
both the transmitter and the receiver have, in a 3-dimensional environment,
multiple bulges (in RF communication this corresponds to antenna). The proposed
system consists of a fluid medium, information molecules, a transmitter, and a
receiver. We simulate the system with a one-shot signal to obtain the channel's
finite impulse response. We then incorporate this result within our
mathematical analysis to determine interference. Molecular communication has a
great need for low complexity, hence, the receiver may have incomplete
information regarding the system and the channel state. Thus, for the cases of
limited information set at the receiver, we propose three detection algorithms,
namely adaptive thresholding, practical zero forcing, and Genie-aided zero
forcing.
"
456,"The Simulation Powers and Limitations of Higher Temperature Hierarchical
  Self-Assembly Systems","  In this paper, we extend existing results about simulation and intrinsic
universality in a model of tile-based self-assembly. Namely, we work within the
2-Handed Assembly Model (2HAM), which is a model of self-assembly in which
assemblies are formed by square tiles that are allowed to combine, using glues
along their edges, individually or as pairs of arbitrarily large assemblies in
a hierarchical manner, and we explore the abilities of these systems to
simulate each other when the simulating systems have a higher ""temperature""
parameter, which is a system wide threshold dictating how many glue bonds must
be formed between two assemblies to allow them to combine. It has previously
been shown that systems with lower temperatures cannot simulate arbitrary
systems with higher temperatures, and also that systems at some higher
temperatures can simulate those at particular lower temperatures, creating an
infinite set of infinite hierarchies of 2HAM systems with strictly increasing
simulation power within each hierarchy. These previous results relied on two
different definitions of simulation, one (strong simulation) seemingly more
restrictive than the other (standard simulation), but which have previously not
been proven to be distinct. Here we prove distinctions between them by first
fully characterizing the set of pairs of temperatures such that the high
temperature systems are intrinsically universal for the lower temperature
systems (i.e. one tile set at the higher temperature can simulate any at the
lower) using strong simulation. This includes the first impossibility result
for simulation downward in temperature. We then show that lower temperature
systems which cannot be simulated by higher temperature systems using the
strong definition, can in fact be simulated using the standard definition,
proving the distinction between the types of simulation.
"
457,A Memcomputing Pascaline,"  The original Pascaline was a mechanical calculator able to sum and subtract
integers. It encodes information in the angles of mechanical wheels and through
a set of gears, and aided by gravity, could perform the calculations. Here, we
show that such a concept can be realized in electronics using memory elements
such as memristive systems. By using memristive emulators we have demonstrated
experimentally the memcomputing version of the mechanical Pascaline, capable of
processing and storing the numerical results in the multiple levels of each
memristive element. Our result is the first experimental demonstration of
multidigit arithmetics with multi-level memory devices that further emphasizes
the versatility and potential of memristive systems for future
massively-parallel high-density computing architectures.
"
458,Molecular MIMO Communication Link,"  In this demonstration, we will present the world's first molecular
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication link to deliver two data
streams in a spatial domain. We show that chemical signals such as
concentration gradients could be used in MIMO fashion to transfer sequential
data. Until now it was unclear whether MIMO techniques, which are used
extensively in modern radio communication, could be applied to molecular
communication. In the demonstration, using our devised MIMO apparatus and
carefully designed detection algorithm, we will show that we can achieve about
1.7 times higher data rate than single input single output (SISO) molecular
communication systems.

459,"The Human Body and Millimeter-Wave Wireless Communication Systems:
  Interactions and Implications","  With increasing interest in millimeter wave wireless communications,
investigations on interactions between the human body and millimeter wave
devices are becoming important. This paper gives examples of current regulatory
requirements, and provides an example for a 60 GHz transceiver. Also, the
propagation characteristics of millimeter-waves in the presence of the human
body are studied, and four models representing different body parts are
considered to evaluate thermal effects of millimeter-wave radiation on the
body. Simulation results show that about 34% to 42% of the incident power is
reflected at the skin surface at 60 GHz. This paper shows that power density is
not suitable to determine exposure compliance when millimeter wave devices are
used very close to the body. A temperature-based technique for the evaluation
of safety compliance is proposed in this paper.
"
460,"Experimental quantum annealing: case study involving the graph
  isomorphism problem","  Quantum annealing is a proposed combinatorial optimization technique meant to
exploit quantum mechanical effects such as tunneling and entanglement.
Real-world quantum annealing-based solvers require a combination of annealing
and classical pre- and post-processing; at this early stage, little is known
about how to partition and optimize the processing. This article presents an
experimental case study of quantum annealing and some of the factors involved
in real-world solvers, using a 504-qubit D-Wave Two machine and the graph
isomorphism problem. To illustrate the role of classical pre-processing, a
compact Hamiltonian is presented that enables a reduced Ising model for each
problem instance. On random N-vertex graphs, the median number of variables is
reduced from N^2 to fewer than N lg N and solvable graph sizes increase from N
= 5 to N = 13. Additionally, a type of classical post-processing error
correction is evaluated. While the solution times are not competitive with
classical approaches to graph isomorphism, the enhanced solver ultimately
classified correctly every problem that was mapped to the processor and
demonstrated clear advantages over the baseline approach. The results shed some
light on the nature of real-world quantum annealing and the associated hybrid
classical-quantum solvers.
"
461,"The Emergence and Dynamical Evolution of Complex Transport Networks from
  Simple Low-Level Behaviours","  The true slime mould Physarum polycephalum is a recent well studied example
of how complex transport networks emerge from simple auto-catalytic and self-
organising local interactions, adapting structure and function against changing
environmental conditions and external perturbation. Physarum networks also
exhibit computationally desirable measures of transport efficiency in terms of
overall path length, minimal connectivity and network resilience. Although
significant progress has been made in mathematically modelling the behaviour of
Physarum networks (and other biological transport networks) based on observed
features in experimental settings, their initial emergence - and in particular
their long-term persistence and evolution - is still poorly understood. We
present a low-level, bottom-up, approach to the modelling of emergent transport
networks. A population of simple particle-like agents coupled with paracrine
chemotaxis behaviours in a dissipative environment results in the spontaneous
emergence of persistent, complex structures. Second order emergent behaviours,
in the form of network surface minimisation, are also observed contributing to
the long term evolution and dynamics of the networks. The framework is extended
to allow data presentation and the population is used to perform a direct
(spatial) approximation of network minimisation problems. Three methods are
employed, loosely relating to behaviours of Physarum under different
environmental conditions. Finally, the low-level approach is summarised with a
view to further research.
"
462,Slime Mould Inspired Generalised Voronoi Diagrams with Repulsive Fields,"  The giant single-celled amoeboid organism Physarum polycephalum constructs
minimising transport networks but can also approximate the Voronoi diagram
using two different mechanisms. In the first method Voronoi bisectors are rep-
resented by deformation of a pre-existing plasmodial network by repellent
sources acting as generating points. In the second method generating points act
as inoculation sites for grow- ing plasmodia and Voronoi bisectors are
represented by vacant regions before the plasmodia fuse. To explore the
behaviour of minimising networks in the presence of repulsion fields we utilise
a computational model of Physarum as a distributed virtual computing material.
We characterise the different types of computational behaviours elicited by
attraction and repulsion stimuli and demonstrate the approximation Voronoi
diagrams using growth towards attractants, avoidance of repellents, and
combinations of both. Approximation of Voronoi diagrams for point data sources,
complex planar shapes and circle sets is demonstrated. By altering repellent
con- centration we found that partition of data sources was maintained but the
internal network connectivity was minimised by the contractile force of the
transport network. To conclude, we find that the repertoire of unconventional
computation methods is enhanced by the addition of stimuli presented by
repellent fields, suggesting novel approaches to plane-division, packing, and
minimisation problems.
"
463,Mixed polarity reversible Peres gates,"  Reversible Peres gates with more than two all over binary-valued control
signals are discussed. Methods are disclosed for the low cost realization of
this kind of Peres gates without requiring ancillary lines. Proper distribution
of the controlled gates and their inverses allow driving the reversible Peres
gate with control signals of different polarities.
"
464,"Leader Election and Shape Formation with Self-Organizing Programmable
  Matter","  We consider programmable matter consisting of simple computational elements,
called particles, that can establish and release bonds and can actively move in
a self-organized way, and we investigate the feasibility of solving fundamental
problems relevant for programmable matter. As a suitable model for such
self-organizing particle systems, we will use a generalization of the geometric
amoebot model first proposed in SPAA 2014. Based on the geometric model, we
present efficient local-control algorithms for leader election and line
formation requiring only particles with constant size memory, and we also
discuss the limitations of solving these problems within the general amoebot
model.
"
465,Recent Development in Analog Computation - A Brief Overview,"  The recent development in analog computation is reviewed in this paper.
Analog computation was used in many applications where power and energy
efficiency is of paramount importance. It is shown that by using innovative
architecture and circuit design, analog computation systems can achieve much
higher energy efficiency than their digital counterparts, as they are able to
exploit the computational power inherent to the devices and physics. However,
these systems do suffer from some disadvantages, such as lower accuracy and
speed, and designers have come up with novel approaches to overcome them. The
paper provides an overview of analog computation systems, from basic components
such as memory and arithmetic elements, to architecture and system design.
"
466,"An Algorithmic Framework for Shape Formation Problems in Self-Organizing
  Particle Systems","  Many proposals have already been made for realizing programmable matter,
ranging from shape-changing molecules, DNA tiles, and synthetic cells to
reconfigurable modular robotics. Envisioning systems of nano-sensors devices,
we are particularly interested in programmable matter consisting of systems of
simple computational elements, called particles, that can establish and release
bonds and can actively move in a self-organized way, and in shape formation
problems relevant for programmable matter in those self-organizing particle
systems (SOPS). In this paper, we present a general algorithmic framework for
shape formation problems in SOPS, and show direct applications of this
framework to the problems of having the particle system self-organize to form a
hexagonal or triangular shape. Our algorithms utilize only local control,
require only constant-size memory particles, and are asymptotically optimal
both in terms of the total number of movements needed to reach the desired
shape configuration.
"
467,Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access for Visible Light Communications,"  The main limitation of visible light communication (VLC) is the narrow
modulation bandwidth, which reduces the achievable data rates. In this paper,
we apply the non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) scheme to enhance the
achievable throughput in high-rate VLC downlink networks. We first propose a
novel gain ratio power allocation (GRPA) strategy that takes into account the
users' channel conditions to ensure efficient and fair power allocation. Our
results indicate that GRPA significantly enhances system performance compared
to the static power allocation. We also study the effect of tuning the
transmission angles of the light emitting diodes (LEDs) and the field of views
(FOVs) of the receivers, and demonstrate that these parameters can offer new
degrees of freedom to boost NOMA performance. Simulation results reveal that
NOMA is a promising multiple access scheme for the downlink of VLC networks.
"
468,Hierarchical Composition of Memristive Networks for Real-Time Computing,"  Advances in materials science have led to physical instantiations of
self-assembled networks of memristive devices and demonstrations of their
computational capability through reservoir computing. Reservoir computing is an
approach that takes advantage of collective system dynamics for real-time
computing. A dynamical system, called a reservoir, is excited with a
time-varying signal and observations of its states are used to reconstruct a
desired output signal. However, such a monolithic assembly limits the
computational power due to signal interdependency and the resulting correlated
readouts. Here, we introduce an approach that hierarchically composes a set of
interconnected memristive networks into a larger reservoir. We use signal
amplification and restoration to reduce reservoir state correlation, which
improves the feature extraction from the input signals. Using the same number
of output signals, such a hierarchical composition of heterogeneous small
networks outperforms monolithic memristive networks by at least 20% on waveform
generation tasks. On the NARMA-10 task, we reduce the error by up to a factor
of 2 compared to homogeneous reservoirs with sigmoidal neurons, whereas single
memristive networks are unable to produce the correct result. Hierarchical
composition is key for solving more complex tasks with such novel nano-scale
hardware.
"
469,An New Type Of Artificial Brain Using Controlled Neurons,"  Plans for a new type of artificial brain are possible because of realistic
neurons in logically structured arrays of controlled toggles, one toggle per
neuron. Controlled toggles can be made to compute, in parallel, parameters of
critical importance for each of several complex images recalled from
associative long term memory. Controlled toggles are shown below to amount to a
new type of neural network that supports autonomous behavior and action.
"
470,"Self-similar Magneto-electric Nanocircuit Technology for Probabilistic
  Inference Engines","  Probabilistic graphical models are powerful mathematical formalisms for
machine learning and reasoning under uncertainty that are widely used for
cognitive computing. However they cannot be employed efficiently for large
problems (with variables in the order of 100K or larger) on conventional
systems, due to inefficiencies resulting from layers of abstraction and
separation of logic and memory in CMOS implementations. In this paper, we
present a magneto-electric probabilistic technology framework for implementing
probabilistic reasoning functions. The technology leverages Straintronic
Magneto-Tunneling Junction (S-MTJ) devices in a novel mixed-signal circuit
framework for direct computations on probabilities while enabling in-memory
computations with persistence. Initial evaluations of the Bayesian likelihood
estimation operation occurring during Bayesian Network inference indicate up to
127x lower area, 214x lower active power, and 70x lower latency compared to an
equivalent 45nm CMOS Boolean implementation.
"
471,A framework for exact synthesis,"  Exact synthesis is a tool used in algorithms for approximating an arbitrary
qubit unitary with a sequence of quantum gates from some finite set. These
approximation algorithms find asymptotically optimal approximations in
probabilistic polynomial time, in some cases even finding the optimal solution
in probabilistic polynomial time given access to an oracle for factoring
integers. In this paper, we present a common mathematical structure underlying
all results related to the exact synthesis of qubit unitaries known to date,
including Clifford+T, Clifford-cyclotomic and V-basis gate sets, as well as
gates sets induced by the braiding of Fibonacci anyons in topological quantum
computing. The framework presented here also provides a means to answer
questions related to the exact synthesis of unitaries for wide classes of other
gate sets, such as Clifford+T+V and SU(2) level k anyons.
"
472,Experimental evidence of chaos from memristors,"  Until now, most memristor-based chaotic circuits proposed in the literature
are based on mathematical models which assume ideal characteristics such as
piece-wise linear or cubic non-linearities. The idea, illustrated here and
originating from the experimental approach for device characterization, is to
realize a chaotic system exploiting the non-linearity of only one memristor
with a very simple experimental set-up using feedback. In this way a simple
circuit is obtained and chaos is experimentally observed and is confirmed by
the calculation of the largest Lyapunov exponent. Numerical results using the
Strukov model support the existence of robust chaos in our circuit. This is the
first experimental demonstration of chaos in a real memristor circuit and
suggests that memristors are well placed for hardware encryption.
"
473,"On Asymptotic Gate Complexity and Depth of Reversible Circuits Without
  Additional Memory","  Reversible computation is one of the most promising emerging technologies of
the future. The usage of reversible circuits in computing devices can lead to a
significantly lower power consumption. In this paper we study reversible logic
circuits consisting of NOT, CNOT and 2-CNOT gates. We introduce a set $F(n,q)$
of all transformations $\mathbb Z_2^n \to \mathbb Z_2^n$ that can be
implemented by reversible circuits with $(n+q)$ inputs. We define the Shannon
gate complexity function $L(n,q)$ and the depth function $D(n,q)$ as functions
of $n$ and the number of additional inputs $q$. First, we prove general lower
bounds for functions $L(n,q)$ and $D(n,q)$. Second, we introduce a new group
theory based synthesis algorithm, which can produce a circuit $\mathfrak S$
without additional inputs and with the gate complexity $L(\mathfrak S) \leq 3n
2^{n+4}(1+o(1)) \mathop / \log_2 n$. Using these bounds, we state that almost
every reversible circuit with no additional inputs, consisting of NOT, CNOT and
2-CNOT gates, implements a transformation from $F(n,0)$ with the gate
complexity $L(n,0) \asymp n 2^n \mathop / \log_2 n$ and with the depth $D(n,0)
\geq 2^n(1-o(1)) \mathop / (3\log_2 n)$.
"
474,A symbolic calculus for a class of quantum computing circuits,"  This paper introduces a symbolic calculus to evaluate the output signals at
the target line(s) of quantum computing subcircuits using controlled negations
and controlled-Q gates, where Q represents the k-th root of [0 1; 1 0], the
unitary matrix of NOT, and k is a power of two. The controlling signals are
GF(2) expressions possibly including Boolean expressions. The method does not
require operating with complex-valued matrices. The method may be used to
verify the functionality and to check for possible minimization of a given
quantum computing circuit using target lines. The method does not apply for a
whole circuit if there are interactions among target lines. In this case the
method applies for the independent subcircuits.
"
475,"Molecular Communications with Longitudinal Carrier Waves: Baseband to
  Passband Modulation","  Traditional molecular communications via diffusion (MCvD) systems have used
baseband modulation techniques by varying properties of molecular pulses such
as the amplitude, the frequency of the transversal wave of the pulse, and the
time delay between subsequent pulses. In this letter, we propose and implement
passband modulation with molecules that exhibit longitudinal carrier wave
properties. This is achieved through the oscillation of the transmitter.
Frequency division multiplexing is employed to allow different molecular
information streams to co-exist in the same space and time channel, creating an
effective bandwidth for MCvD.
"
476,"A Spatiotemporal Context Definition for Service Adaptation Prediction in
  a Pervasive Computing Environment","  Pervasive systems refers to context-aware systems that can sense their
context, and adapt their behavior accordingly to provide adaptable services.
Proactive adaptation of such systems allows changing the service and the
context based on prediction. However, the definition of the context is still
vague and not suitable to prediction. In this paper we discuss and classify
previous definitions of context. Then, we present a new definition which allows
pervasive systems to understand and predict their contexts. We analyze the
essential lines that fall within the context definition, and propose some
scenarios to make it clear our approach.
"
477,"On Asymptotic Gate Complexity and Depth of Reversible Circuits With
  Additional Memory","  The reversible logic can be used in various research areas, e.g. quantum
computation, cryptography and signal processing. In the paper we study
reversible logic circuits with additional inputs, which consist of NOT, CNOT
and C\textsuperscript{2}NOT gates. We consider a set $F(n,q)$ of all
transformations $\mathbb B^n \to \mathbb B^n$ that can be realized by
reversible circuits with $(n+q)$ inputs. An analogue of Lupanov's method for
the synthesis of reversible logic circuits with additional inputs is described.
We prove upper asymptotic bounds for the Shannon gate complexity function
$L(n,q)$ and the depth function $D(n,q)$ in case of $q > 0$: $L(n,q_0) \lesssim
2^n$ if $q_0 \sim n 2^{n-o(n)}$ and $D(n,q_1) \lesssim 3n$ if $q_1 \sim 2^n$.
"
478,The Computational Universality of Metabolic Computing,"  System and synthetic biology are rapidly evolving systems, but both lack
tools such as those used in engineering environments to shift the their focus
from the design of parts (details) to the design of systems (behaviors); to
aggravate, there are insufficient theoretical justifications on the
computational limits of biological systems. To diminish these deficiencies, we
present theoretical results over the Turing-equivalence of metabolic systems,
defines rules for translations of algorithms into metabolic P systems and
presents a software tool to assist the task in an automatic way.
"
479,"Smart Detector Cell: A Scalable All-Spin Circuit for Low Power
  Non-Boolean Pattern Recognition","  We present a new circuit for non-Boolean recognition of binary images.
Employing all-spin logic (ASL) devices, we design logic comparators and
non-Boolean decision blocks for compact and efficient computation. By
manipulation of fan-in number in different stages of the circuit, the structure
can be extended for larger training sets or larger images. Operating based on
the mainly similarity idea, the system is capable of constructing a mean image
and compare it with a separate input image within a short decision time. Taking
advantage of the non-volatility of ASL devices, the proposed circuit is capable
of hybrid memory/logic operation. Compared with existing CMOS pattern
recognition circuits, this work achieves a smaller footprint, lower power
consumption, faster decision time and a lower operational voltage. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first fully spin-based complete pattern
recognition circuit demonstrated using spintronic devices.
"
480,Sub-Nanosecond Time of Flight on Commercial Wi-Fi Cards,"  Time-of-flight, i.e., the time incurred by a signal to travel from
transmitter to receiver, is perhaps the most intuitive way to measure distances
using wireless signals. It is used in major positioning systems such as GPS,
RADAR, and SONAR. However, attempts at using time-of-flight for indoor
localization have failed to deliver acceptable accuracy due to fundamental
limitations in measuring time on Wi-Fi and other RF consumer technologies.
While the research community has developed alternatives for RF-based indoor
localization that do not require time-of-flight, those approaches have their
own limitations that hamper their use in practice. In particular, many existing
approaches need receivers with large antenna arrays while commercial Wi-Fi
nodes have two or three antennas. Other systems require fingerprinting the
environment to create signal maps. More fundamentally, none of these methods
support indoor positioning between a pair of Wi-Fi devices
without~third~party~support.
  In this paper, we present a set of algorithms that measure the time-of-flight
to sub-nanosecond accuracy on commercial Wi-Fi cards. We implement these
algorithms and demonstrate a system that achieves accurate device-to-device
localization, i.e. enables a pair of Wi-Fi devices to locate each other without
any support from the infrastructure, not even the location of the access
points.
"
481,"A domain-level DNA strand displacement reaction enumerator allowing
  arbitrary non-pseudoknotted secondary structures","  DNA strand displacement systems have proven themselves to be fertile
substrates for the design of programmable molecular machinery and circuitry.
Domain-level reaction enumerators provide the foundations for molecular
programming languages by formalizing DNA strand displacement mechanisms and
modeling interactions at the ""domain"" level - one level of abstraction above
models that explicitly describe DNA strand sequences. Unfortunately, the
most-developed models currently only treat pseudo-linear DNA structures, while
many systems being experimentally and theoretically pursued exploit a much
broader range of secondary structure configurations. Here, we describe a new
domain-level reaction enumerator that can handle arbitrary non-pseudoknotted
secondary structures and reaction mechanisms including association and
dissociation, 3-way and 4-way branch migration, and direct as well as remote
toehold activation. To avoid polymerization that is inherent when considering
general structures, we employ a time-scale separation technique that holds in
the limit of low concentrations. This also allows us to ""condense"" the detailed
reactions by eliminating fast transients, with provable guarantees of
correctness for the set of reactions and their kinetics. We hope that the new
reaction enumerator will be used in new molecular programming languages,
compilers, and tools for analysis and verification that treat a wider variety
of mechanisms of interest to experimental and theoretical work. We have
implemented this enumerator in Python, and it is included in the DyNAMiC
Workbench Integrated Development Environment.
"
482,Robust Biomolecular Finite Automata,"  We present a uniform method for translating an arbitrary nondeterministic
finite automaton (NFA) into a deterministic mass action input/output chemical
reaction network (I/O CRN) that simulates it. The I/O CRN receives its input as
a continuous time signal consisting of concentrations of chemical species that
vary to represent the NFA's input string in a natural way. The I/O CRN exploits
the inherent parallelism of chemical kinetics to simulate the NFA in real time
with a number of chemical species that is linear in the size of the NFA. We
prove that the simulation is correct and that it is robust with respect to
perturbations of the input signal, the initial concentrations of species, the
output (decision), and the rate constants of the reactions of the I/O CRN.
"
483,Low voltage and time constant organic synapse-transistor,"  We report on an artificial synapse, an organic synapse-transistor (synapstor)
working at 1 volt and with a typical response time in the range 100-200 ms.
This device (also called NOMFET, Nanoparticle Organic Memory Field Effect
Transistor) combines a memory and a transistor effect in a single device. We
demonstrate that short-term plasticity (STP), a typical synaptic behavior, is
observed when stimulating the device with input spikes of 1 volt. Both
significant facilitating and depressing behaviors of this artificial synapse
are observed with a relative amplitude of about 50% and a dynamic response <
200 ms. From a series of in-situ experiments, i.e. measuring the
current-voltage characteristic curves in-situ and in real time, during the
growth of the pentacene over a network of gold nanoparticles, we elucidate
these results by analyzing the relationship between the organic film morphology
and the transport properties. This synapstor works at a low energy of about 2
nJ/spike. We discuss the implications of these results for the development of
neuro-inspired computing architectures and interfacing with biological neurons.

484,"Natural Data Storage: A Review on sending Information from now to then
  via Nature","  Digital data explosion drives a demand for robust and reliable data storage
medium. Development of better digital storage device to accumulate Zetta bytes
(1 ZB = $10^{21}$ bytes ) of data that will be generated in near future is a
big challenge. Looking at limitations of present day digital storage devices,
it will soon be a big challenge for data scientists to provide reliable.
affordable and dense storage medium. As an alternative, researcher used natural
medium of storage like DNA, bacteria and protein as information storage
systems. This article discuss DNA based information storage system in detail
along with an overview about bacterial and protein data storage systems.
"
485,Self-Adaptive Spike-Time-Dependent Plasticity of Metal-Oxide Memristors,"  Metal-oxide memristors have emerged as promising candidates for hardware
implementation of artificial synapses - the key components of high-performance,
analog neuromorphic networks - due to their excellent scaling prospects. Since
some advanced cognitive tasks require spiking neuromorphic networks, which
explicitly model individual neural pulses (spikes) in biological neural
systems, it is crucial for memristive synapses to support the
spike-time-dependent plasticity (STDP), which is believed to be the primary
mechanism of Hebbian adaptation. A major challenge for the STDP implementation
is that, in contrast to some simplistic models of the plasticity, the
elementary change of a synaptic weight in an artificial hardware synapse
depends not only on the pre-synaptic and post-synaptic signals, but also on the
initial weight (memristor's conductance) value. Here we experimentally
demonstrate, for the first time, STDP protocols that ensure self-adaptation of
the average memristor conductance, making the plasticity stable, i.e.
insensitive to the initial state of the devices. The experiments have been
carried out with 200-nm Al2O3/TiO2-x memristors integrated into 12x12
crossbars. The experimentally observed self-adaptive STDP behavior has been
complemented with numerical modeling of weight dynamics in a simple system with
a leaky-integrate-and-fire neuron with a random spike-train input, using a
compact model of memristor plasticity, fitted for quantitatively correct
description of our memristors.
"
486,"Topological characterization of S[B] systems: From data to models of
  complexity","  In this paper we propose a methodology for deriving a model of a complex
system by exploiting the information extracted from Topological Data Analysis.
Central to our approach is the S[B] paradigm in which a complex system is
represented by a two-level model. One level, the structural S one, is derived
using the newly introduced quantitative concept of Persistent Entropy. The
other level, the behavioral B one, is characterized by a network of interacting
computational agents described by a Higher Dimensional Automaton. The
methodology yields also a representation of the evolution of the derived
two-level model as a Persistent Entropy Automaton. The presented methodology is
applied to a real case study, the Idiotypic Network of the mammal immune
system.
"
487,Concentration Independent Random Number Generation in Tile Self-Assembly,"  In this paper we introduce the \emph{robust random number generation} problem
where the goal is to design an abstract tile assembly system (aTAM system)
whose terminal assemblies can be split into $n$ partitions such that a
resulting assembly of the system lies within each partition with probability
1/$n$, regardless of the relative concentration assignment of the tile types in
the system. First, we show this is possible for $n=2$ (a \emph{robust fair coin
flip}) within the aTAM, and that such systems guarantee a worst case
$\mathcal{O}(1)$ space usage. We accompany our primary construction with
variants that show trade-offs in space complexity, initial seed size,
temperature, tile complexity, bias, and extensibility, and also prove some
negative results. As an application, we combine our coin-flip system with a
result of Chandran, Gopalkrishnan, and Reif to show that for any positive
integer $n$, there exists a $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$ tile system that assembles a
constant-width linear assembly of expected length $n$ for any concentration
assignment. We then extend our robust fair coin flip result to solve the
problem of robust random number generation in the aTAM for all $n$. Two
variants of robust random bit generation solutions are presented: an unbounded
space solution and a bounded space solution which incurs a small bias. Further,
we consider the harder scenario where tile concentrations change arbitrarily at
each assembly step and show that while this is not possible in the aTAM, the
problem can be solved by exotic tile assembly models from the literature.
"
488,"A CMOS Spiking Neuron for Dense Memristor-Synapse Connectivity for
  Brain-Inspired Computing","  Neuromorphic systems that densely integrate CMOS spiking neurons and
nano-scale memristor synapses open a new avenue of brain-inspired computing.
Existing silicon neurons have molded neural biophysical dynamics but are
incompatible with memristor synapses, or used extra training circuitry thus
eliminating much of the density advantages gained by using memristors, or were
energy inefficient. Here we describe a novel CMOS spiking leaky
integrate-and-fire neuron circuit. Building on a reconfigurable architecture
with a single opamp, the described neuron accommodates a large number of
memristor synapses, and enables online spike timing dependent plasticity (STDP)
learning with optimized power consumption. Simulation results of an 180nm CMOS
design showed 97% power efficiency metric when realizing STDP learning in
10,000 memristor synapses with a nominal 1M{\Omega} memristance, and only
13{\mu}A current consumption when integrating input spikes. Therefore, the
described CMOS neuron contributes a generalized building block for large-scale
brain-inspired neuromorphic systems.
"
489,"Homogeneous Spiking Neuromorphic System for Real-World Pattern
  Recognition","  A neuromorphic chip that combines CMOS analog spiking neurons and memristive
synapses offers a promising solution to brain-inspired computing, as it can
provide massive neural network parallelism and density. Previous hybrid analog
CMOS-memristor approaches required extensive CMOS circuitry for training, and
thus eliminated most of the density advantages gained by the adoption of
memristor synapses. Further, they used different waveforms for pre and
post-synaptic spikes that added undesirable circuit overhead. Here we describe
a hardware architecture that can feature a large number of memristor synapses
to learn real-world patterns. We present a versatile CMOS neuron that combines
integrate-and-fire behavior, drives passive memristors and implements
competitive learning in a compact circuit module, and enables in-situ
plasticity in the memristor synapses. We demonstrate handwritten-digits
recognition using the proposed architecture using transistor-level circuit
simulations. As the described neuromorphic architecture is homogeneous, it
realizes a fundamental building block for large-scale energy-efficient
brain-inspired silicon chips that could lead to next-generation cognitive
computing.
"
490,Programs as Polypeptides,"  We describe a visual programming language for defining behaviors manifested
by reified actors in a 2D virtual world that can be compiled into programs
comprised of sequences of combinators that are themselves reified as actors.
This makes it possible to build programs that build programs from components of
a few fixed types delivered by diffusion using processes that resemble
chemistry as much as computation.
"
491,Reversible Logic Synthesis with Minimal Usage of Ancilla Bits,"  Reversible logic has attracted much research interest over the last few
decades, especially due to its application in quantum computing. In the
construction of reversible gates from basic gates, ancilla bits are commonly
used to remove restrictions on the type of gates that a certain set of basic
gates generates. With unlimited ancilla bits, many gates (such as Toffoli and
Fredkin) become universal reversible gates. However, ancilla bits can be
expensive to implement, thus making the problem of minimizing necessary ancilla
bits a practical topic.
  This thesis explores the problem of reversible logic synthesis using a single
base gate and a few ancilla bits. Two base gates are discussed: a variation of
the 3-bit Toffoli gate and the original 3-bit Fredkin gate. There are three
main results associated with these two gates: i) the variated Toffoli gate can
generate all n-bit reversible gates using 1 ancilla bit, ii) the variated
Toffoli can generate all n-bit reversible gates that are even permutations
using no ancilla bit, iii) the Fredkin gate can generate all n-bit conservative
reversible gates using 1 ancilla bit. Prior to this paper, the best known
result for general universality requires three basic gates, and the best known
result for conservative universality needs 5 ancilla bits. The second result is
trivially optimal. For the first and the third result, we explicitly prove
their optimality: the variated Toffoli cannot generate all n-bit reversible
gates without using any extra input lines, and the Fredkin gate cannot generate
all n-bit conservative reversible gates without using extra input lines. We
also explore a stronger version of the second converse by introducing a new
concept called borrowed bits, and prove that the Fredkin gate cannot generate
all n-bit conservative reversible gates without ancilla bits, even with an
unlimited number of borrowed bits.
"
492,Logical Inference by DNA Strand Algebra,"  Based on the concept of DNA strand displacement and DNA strand algebra we
have developed a method for logical inference which is not based on silicon
based computing. Essentially, it is a paradigm shift from silicon to carbon. In
this paper we have considered the inference mechanism, viz. modus ponens, to
draw conclusion from any observed fact. Thus, the present approach to logical
inference based on DNA strand algebra is basically an attempt to develop expert
system design in the domain of DNA computing. We have illustrated our
methodology with respect to worked out example. Our methodology is very
flexible for implementation of different expert system applications.
"
493,Memristor Load Current Mirror Circuit,"  Simple current mirrors with semiconductor resistive loads suffer from large
on-chip area, leakage currents and thermal effects. In this paper, we report
the feasibility of using memristive loads as a replacement of semiconductor
resistors in simplistic current mirror configuration. We report power, area and
total harmonic distribution, and report the corner conditions on resistance
tolerances.
"
494,Hybrid Memristor-CMOS (MeMOS) based Logic Gates and Adder Circuits,"  Practical memristor came into picture just few years back and instantly
became the topic of interest for researchers and scientists. Memristor is the
fourth basic two-terminal passive circuit element apart from well known
resistor, capacitor and inductor. Recently, memristor based architectures has
been proposed by many researchers. In this paper, we have designed a hybrid
Memristor-CMOS (MeMOS) logic based adder circuit that can be used in numerous
logic computational architectures. We have also analyzed the transient response
of logic gates designed using MeMOS logic circuits. MeMOS use CMOS 180 nm
process with memristor to compute boolean logic operations. Various parameters
including speed, ares, delay and power dissipation are computed and compared
with standard CMOS 180 nm logic design. The proposed logic shows better area
utilization and excellent results from existing CMOS logic circuits at standard
1.8 V operating voltage.

495,A review on memristor applications,"  This article presents a review on the main applications of the fourth
fundamental circuit element, named ""memristor"", which had been proposed for the
first time by Leon Chua and has recently been developed by a team at HP
Laboratories led by Stanley Williams. In particular, after a brief analysis of
memristor theory with a description of the first memristor, manufactured at HP
Laboratories, we present its main applications in the circuit design and
computer technology, together with future developments.

"
497,"Simultaneously Solving Computational Problems Using an Artificial
  Chemical Reactor","  This paper is centered on using chemical reaction as a computational metaphor
for simultaneously solving problems. An artificial chemical reactor that can
simultaneously solve instances of three unrelated problems was created. The
reactor is a distributed stochastic algorithm that simulates a chemical
universe wherein the molecular species are being represented either by a human
genomic contig panel, a Hamiltonian cycle, or an aircraft landing schedule. The
chemical universe is governed by reactions that can alter genomic sequences,
re-order Hamiltonian cycles, or reschedule an aircraft landing program.
Molecular masses were considered as measures of goodness of solutions, and
represented radiation hybrid (RH) vector similarities, costs of Hamiltonian
cycles, and penalty costs for landing an aircraft before and after target
landing times. This method, tested by solving in tandem with deterministic
algorithms, has been shown to find quality solutions in finding the minima RH
vector similarities of genomic data, minima costs in Hamiltonian cycles of the
traveling salesman, and minima costs for landing aircrafts before or after
target landing times.
"
498,"Binary full adder, made of fusion gates, in sub-excitable
  Belousov-Zhabotinsky system","  A sub-excitable BZ medium responds to asymmetric local perturbation by
producing travelling localised excitation wave-fragments, distant relatives of
dissipative solitons. The size and life span of an excitation wave-fragment
depend on the illumination level of the medium. Under the right conditions the
wave-fragments conserve their shape and velocity vectors for extended time
periods. We interpret the wave-fragments as values of Boolean variables. When
two or more wave-fragments collide they annihilate or merge into a new
wave-fragment. States of the logic variables, represented by the
wave-fragments, are changed in the result of the collision between the
wave-fragments. Thus, a logical gate is implemented. Several theoretical
designs and experimental laboratory implementations of Boolean logic gates have
been proposed in the past but little has been done cascading the gates into
binary arithmetical circuits. We propose a unique design of a binary one-bit
full adder based on a fusion gate. A fusion gate is a two-input three-output
logical device which calculates conjunction of the input variables and
conjunction of one input variable with negation of another input variable. The
gate is made of three channels: two channels cross each other at an angle,
third channel starts at the junction. The channels contain BZ medium. When two
excitation wave-fragments, travelling towards each other along input channels,
collide at the junction they merge into a single wave-front travelling along
the third channel. If there is just one wave-front in the input channel, the
front continues its propagation undisturbed. We make a one-bit full adder by
cascading two fusion gates. We show how to cascade the adder blocks into a
many-bit full adder. We evaluate feasibility of our designs by simulating
evolution of excitation in the gates and adders using numerical integration of
Oregonator equations.
"
499,Multi-mode Sampling Period Selection for Embedded Real Time Control,"  Recent studies have shown that adaptively regulating the sampling rate
results in significant reduction in computational resources in embedded
software based control. Selecting a uniform sampling rate for a control loop is
robust, but overtly pessimistic for sharing processors among multiple control
loops. Fine grained regulation of periodicity achieves better resource
utilization, but is hard to implement online in a robust way. In this paper we
propose multi-mode sampling period selection, derived from an offline control
theoretic analysis of the system. We report significant gains in computational
efficiency without trading off control performance.
"
500,Artificial Catalytic Reactions in 2D for Combinatorial Optimization,"  Presented in this paper is a derivation of a 2D catalytic reaction-based
model to solve combinatorial optimization problems (COPs). The simulated
catalytic reactions, a computational metaphor, occurs in an artificial chemical
reactor that finds near-optimal solutions to COPs. The artificial environment
is governed by catalytic reactions that can alter the structure of artificial
molecular elements. Altering the molecular structure means finding new
solutions to the COP. The molecular mass of the elements was considered as a
measure of goodness of fit of the solutions. Several data structures and
matrices were used to record the directions and locations of the molecules.
These provided the model the 2D topology. The Traveling Salesperson Problem
(TSP) was used as a working example. The performance of the model in finding a
solution for the TSP was compared to the performance of a topology-less model.
Experimental results show that the 2D model performs better than the
topology-less one.
"
501,Boolean gates on actin filaments,"  Actin is a globular protein which forms long polar filaments in the
eukaryotic cytoskeleton. Actin networks play a key role in cell mechanics and
cell motility. They have also been implicated in information transmission and
processing, memory and learning in neuronal cells. The acting filaments have
been shown to support propagation of voltage pulses. Here we apply a coupled
nonlinear transmission line model of actin filaments to study interactions
between voltage pulses. By assigning a logical {\sc Truth} to the presence of a
voltage pulses in a given location of the actin filament, and {\sc False} to
the pulse's absence we represent digital information transmission along these
filaments. When two pulses, representing Boolean values of input variables,
interact, then they can facilitate or inhibit further propagation of each
other. We explore this phenomenon to construct Boolean logical gates and a
one-bit half-adder with interacting voltage pulses. We discuss implications of
these findings on cellular process and technological applications.
"
502,"Experimental Demonstration of Efficient Spin-Orbit Torque Switching of
  an MTJ with sub-100 ns Pulses","  Efficient generation of spin currents from charge currents is of high
importance for memory and logic applications of spintronics. In particular,
generation of spin currents from charge currents in high spin-orbit coupling
metals has the potential to provide a scalable solution for embedded memory. We
demonstrate a net reduction in critical charge current for spin torque driven
magnetization reversal via using spin-orbit mediated spin current generation.
We scaled the dimensions of the spin-orbit electrode to 400 nm and the
nanomagnet to 270 nm x 68 nm in a three terminal spin-orbit torque, magnetic
tunnel junction (SOT-MTJ) geometry. Our estimated effective spin Hall angle is
0.15-0.20 using the ratio of zero temperature critical current from spin Hall
switching and estimated spin current density for switching the magnet. We show
bidirectional transient switching using spin-orbit generated spin torque at 100
ns switching pulses reliably followed by transient read operations. We finally
compare the static and dynamic response of the SOT-MTJ with transient spin
circuit modeling showing the performance of scaled SOT-MTJs to enable
nanosecond class non-volatile MTJs.
"
503,"Quantum Computing Assisted Medium Access Control for Multiple Client
  Station Networks","  A medium access control protocol based on quantum entanglement has been
introduced by Berces and Imre (2006) and Van Meter (2012). This protocol
entirely avoids collisions. It is assumed that the network consists of one
access point and two client stations. We extend this scheme to a network with
an arbitrary number of client stations. We propose three approaches, namely,
the qubit distribution, transmit first election and temporal ordering
protocols. The qubit distribution protocol leverages the concepts of Bell-EPR
pair or W state triad. It works for networks of up to four CSs. With up to
three CSs, there is no probability of collision. In a four-CS network, there is
a low probability of collision. The transmit first election protocol and
temporal ordering protocols work for a network with any number of CSs. The
transmit first election builds upon the concept of W state of size
corresponding to the number of client stations. It is fair and collision free.
The temporal ordering protocol employs the concepts of Lehmer code and quantum
oracle. It is collision free, has a normalized throughput of 100% and achieves
quasi-fairness.
"
504,A Diffusion-Neuron Hybrid System for Molecular Communication,"  Diffusion-based and neural communication are two interesting domains in
molecular communication. Both of them have distinct advantages and are
exploited separately in many works. However, in some cases, neural and
diffusion-based ways have to work together for a communication. Therefore, in
this paper, we propose a hybrid communication system, in which the
diffusion-based and neural communication channels are contained. Multiple
connection nano-devices (CND) are used to connect the two channels. We define
the practice function of the CNDs and develop the mechanism of exchanging
information from diffusion-based to neural channel, based on the biological
characteristics of the both channels. In addition, we establish a brief
mathematical model to present the complete communication process of the hybrid
system. The information exchange process at the CNDs is shown in the
simulation. The bit error rate (BER) indicator is used to verify the
reliability of communication. The result reveals that based on the biological
channels, optimizing some parameters of nano-devices could improve the
reliability performance.

505,DNA-Based Storage: Trends and Methods,"  We provide an overview of current approaches to DNA-based storage system
design and accompanying synthesis, sequencing and editing methods. We also
introduce and analyze a suite of new constrained coding schemes for both
archival and random access DNA storage channels. The mathematical basis of our
work is the construction and design of sequences over discrete alphabets that
avoid pre-specified address patterns, have balanced base content, and exhibit
other relevant substring constraints. These schemes adapt the stored signals to
the DNA medium and thereby reduce the inherent error-rate of the system.
"
506,Prediction of Radiation Fog by DNA Computing,"  In this paper we propose a wet lab algorithm for prediction of radiation fog
by DNA computing. The concept of DNA computing is essentially exploited for
generating the classifier algorithm in the wet lab. The classifier is based on
a new concept of similarity based fuzzy reasoning suitable for wet lab
implementation. This new concept of similarity based fuzzy reasoning is
different from conventional approach to fuzzy reasoning based on similarity
measure and also replaces the logical aspect of classical fuzzy reasoning by
DNA chemistry. Thus, we add a new dimension to existing forms of fuzzy
reasoning by bringing it down to nanoscale. We exploit the concept of massive
parallelism of DNA computing by designing this new classifier in the wet lab.
This newly designed classifier is very much generalized in nature and apart
from prediction of radiation fog this methodology can be applied to other types
of data also. To achieve our goal we first fuzzify the given observed
parameters in a form of synthetic DNA sequence which is called fuzzy DNA and
which handles the vague concept of human reasoning.
"
507,Emulating short-term synaptic dynamics with memristive devices,"  Neuromorphic architectures offer great promise for achieving computation
capacities beyond conventional Von Neumann machines. The essential elements for
achieving this vision are highly scalable synaptic mimics that do not undermine
biological fidelity. Here we demonstrate that single solid-state TiO2
memristors can exhibit non-associative plasticity phenomena observed in
biological synapses, supported by their metastable memory state transition
properties. We show that, contrary to conventional uses of solid-state memory,
the existence of rate-limiting volatility is a key feature for capturing
short-term synaptic dynamics. We also show how the temporal dynamics of our
prototypes can be exploited to implement spatio-temporal computation,
demonstrating the memristors full potential for building biophysically
realistic neural processing systems.
"
508,"Future Large-Scale Memristive Device Crossbar Arrays: Limits Imposed by
  Sneak-Path Currents on Read Operations","  Passive crossbar arrays based upon memristive devices, at crosspoints, hold
great promise for the future high-density and non-volatile memories. The most
significant challenge facing memristive device based crossbars today is the
problem of sneak-path currents. In this paper, we investigate a memristive
device with intrinsic rectification behavior to suppress the sneak-path
currents in crossbar arrays. The device model is implemented in Verilog-A
language and is simulated to match device characteristics readily available in
the literature. Then, we systematically evaluate the read operation performance
of large-scale crossbar arrays utilizing our proposed model in terms of read
margin and power consumption while considering different crossbar sizes,
interconnect resistance values, HRS/LRS (High Resistance State/Low Resistance
State) values, rectification ratios and different read-schemes. The outcomes of
this study are understanding the trade-offs among read margin, power
consumption, read-schemes and most importantly providing a guideline for
circuit designers to improve the performance of a memory based crossbar
structure. In addition, read operation performance comparison of the intrinsic
rectifying memristive device model with other memristive device models are
studied.
"
509,A Batteryless Sensor ASIC for Implantable Bio-impedance Applications,"  The measurement of the biological tissue's electrical impedance is an active
research field that has attracted a lot of attention during the last decades.
Bio-impedances are closely related to a large variety of physiological
conditions; therefore, they are useful for diagnosis and monitoring in many
medical applications. Measuring living tissues, however, is a challenging task
that poses countless technical and practical problems, in particular if the
tissues need to be measured under the skin. This paper presents a bio-impedance
sensor ASIC targeting a battery-free, miniature size, implantable device, which
performs accurate 4-point complex impedance extraction in the frequency range
from 2 kHz to 2 MHz. The ASIC is fabricated in 150 nm CMOS, has a size of 1.22
mm x 1.22 mm and consumes 165 uA from a 1.8 V power supply. The ASIC is
embedded in a prototype which communicates with, and is powered by an external
reader device through inductive coupling. The prototype is validated by
measuring the impedances of different combinations of discrete components,
measuring the electrochemical impedance of physiological solution, and
performing ex vivo measurements on animal organs. The proposed ASIC is able to
extract complex impedances with around 1 Ohm resolution; therefore enabling
accurate wireless tissue measurements.
"
510,"Computational Capacity and Energy Consumption of Complex Resistive
  Switch Networks","  Resistive switches are a class of emerging nanoelectronics devices that
exhibit a wide variety of switching characteristics closely resembling
behaviors of biological synapses. Assembled into random networks, such
resistive switches produce emerging behaviors far more complex than that of
individual devices. This was previously demonstrated in simulations that
exploit information processing within these random networks to solve tasks that
require nonlinear computation as well as memory. Physical assemblies of such
networks manifest complex spatial structures and basic processing capabilities
often related to biologically-inspired computing. We model and simulate random
resistive switch networks and analyze their computational capacities. We
provide a detailed discussion of the relevant design parameters and establish
the link to the physical assemblies by relating the modeling parameters to
physical parameters. More globally connected networks and an increased network
switching activity are means to increase the computational capacity linearly at
the expense of exponentially growing energy consumption. We discuss a new
modular approach that exhibits higher computational capacities and energy
consumption growing linearly with the number of networks used. The results show
how to optimize the trade-off between computational capacity and energy
efficiency and are relevant for the design and fabrication of novel computing
architectures that harness random assemblies of emerging nanodevices.
"
511,Application of Permutation Group Theory in Reversible Logic Synthesis,"  The paper discusses various applications of permutation group theory in the
synthesis of reversible logic circuits consisting of Toffoli gates with
negative control lines. An asymptotically optimal synthesis algorithm for
circuits consisting of gates from the NCT library is described. An algorithm
for gate complexity reduction, based on equivalent replacements of gates
compositions, is introduced. A new approach for combining a group-theory-based
synthesis algorithm with a Reed-Muller-spectra-based synthesis algorithm is
described. Experimental results are presented to show that the proposed
synthesis techniques allow a reduction in input lines count, gate complexity or
quantum cost of reversible circuits for various benchmark functions.
"
512,"Rapid Co-optimization of Processing and Circuit Design to Overcome
  Carbon Nanotube Variations","  Carbon nanotube field-effect transistors (CNFETs) are promising candidates
for building energy-efficient digital systems at highly-scaled technology
nodes. However, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are inherently subject to variations
that reduce circuit yield, increase susceptibility to noise, and severely
degrade their anticipated energy and speed benefits. Joint exploration and
optimization of CNT processing options and CNFET circuit design are required to
overcome this outstanding challenge. Unfortunately, existing approaches for
such exploration and optimization are computationally expensive, and mostly
rely on trial-and-error-based ad hoc techniques. In this paper, we present a
framework that quickly evaluates the impact of CNT variations on circuit delay
and noise margin, and systematically explores the large space of CNT processing
options to derive optimized CNT processing and CNFET circuit design guidelines.
We demonstrate that our framework: 1) runs over 100x faster than existing
approaches, and 2) accurately identifies the most important CNT processing
parameters, together with CNFET circuit design parameters (e.g., for CNFET
sizing and standard cell layouts), to minimize the impact of CNT variations on
CNFET circuit speed with less than 5% energy cost, while simultaneously meeting
circuit-level noise margin and yield constraints.
"
513,"The Service-Bond Paradigm - Potentials for a Sustainable, ICT-enabled
  Future","  The service paradigm as we know it has gone through a long journey of
evolution and improvement, and it seems that a service-oriented vision to
activities in general could serve as a potential platform for the global
transition to a sustainable future. However, it is also apparent that the
services themselves are required to move beyond their traditional definition in
order to prevent any secondary side effect. Here, a new paradigm is proposed
based on bonding between entities involved in a service interaction, service
chaining, or service orchestration. It is purposed to serve as a vehicle to
approach sustainability at the global level in a manner that is thoughtful,
collaborative, and incremental. Time-modulated implementation of the proposed
service-bond paradigm is considered in order to reduce the associated risks and
liabilities. The service bonds are then simply generalized toward representing
bonding among more than two entities. Finally, a practical application of ICT
agents in enabling the service bonds is presented in a use case related to
smart houses. In this use case, some ICT-based agents (federal regulars, among
other ICT agents) are considered to represent and govern services and service
bonds of a household with external entities such as utilities.
"
514,Memristive integrative sensors for neuronal activity,"  The advent of advanced neuronal interfaces offers great promise for linking
brain functions to electronics. A major bottleneck in achieving this is
real-time processing of big data that imposes excessive requirements on
bandwidth, energy and computation capacity; limiting the overall number of
bio-electronic links. Here, we present a novel monitoring system concept that
exploits the intrinsic properties of memristors for processing neural
information in real time. We demonstrate that the inherent voltage thresholds
of solid-state TiOx memristors can be useful for discriminating significant
neural activity, i.e. spiking events, from noise. When compared with a
multi-dimensional, principal component feature space threshold detector, our
system is capable of recording the majority of significant events, without
resorting to computationally heavy off-line processing. We also show a
memristive integrating sensing array that discriminates neuronal activity
recorded in-vitro. We prove that information on spiking event amplitude is
simultaneously transduced and stored as non-volatile resistive state
transitions, allowing for more efficient data compression, demonstrating the
memristors' potential for building scalable, yet energy efficient on-node
processors for big data.
"
515,Molecular Communications: Channel Model and Physical Layer Techniques,"  This article examines recent research in molecular communications from a
telecommunications system design perspective. In particular, it focuses on
channel models and state-of-the-art physical layer techniques. The goal is to
provide a foundation for higher layer research and motivation for research and
development of functional prototypes. In the first part of the article, we
focus on the channel and noise model, comparing molecular and radio-wave
pathloss formulae. In the second part, the article examines, equipped with the
appropriate channel knowledge, the design of appropriate modulation and error
correction coding schemes. The third reviews transmitter and receiver side
signal processing methods that suppress inter-symbol-interference. Taken
together, the three parts present a series of physical layer techniques that
are necessary to producing reliable and practical molecular communications.
"
516,Building an iterative heuristic solver for a quantum annealer,"  A quantum annealer heuristically minimizes quadratic unconstrained binary
optimization (QUBO) problems, but is limited by the physical hardware in the
size and density of the problems it can handle. We have developed a
meta-heuristic solver that utilizes D-Wave Systems' quantum annealer (or any
other QUBO problem optimizer) to solve larger or denser problems, by
iteratively solving subproblems, while keeping the rest of the variables fixed.
We present our algorithm, several variants, and the results for the
optimization of standard QUBO problem instances from OR-Library of sizes 500
and 2500 as well as the Palubeckis instances of sizes 3000 to 7000. For
practical use of the solver, we show the dependence of the time to best
solution on the desired gap to the best known solution. In addition, we study
the dependence of the gap and the time to best solution on the size of the
problems solved by the underlying optimizer.
"
517,Zero and negative energy dissipation at information-theoretic erasure,"  We introduce information-theoretic erasure based on Shannon's binary channel
formula. It is pointed out that this type of erasure is a natural
energy-dissipation-free way in which information is lost in
double-potential-well memories, and it may be the reason why the brain can
forget things effortlessly. We also demonstrate a new non-volatile,
charge-based memory scheme wherein the erasure can be associated with even
negative energy dissipation; this implies that the memory's environment is
cooled during information erasure and contradicts Landauer's principle of
erasure dissipation. On the other hand, writing new information into the memory
always requires positive energy dissipation in our schemes. Finally, we show a
simple system where even a classical erasure process yields negative energy
dissipation of arbitrarily large energy.
"
518,A Simplified Phase Model for Oscillator Based Computing,"  Building oscillator based computing systems with emerging nano-device
technologies has become a promising solution for unconventional computing tasks
like computer vision and pattern recognition. However, simulation and analysis
of these systems is both time and compute intensive due to the nonlinearity of
new devices and the complex behavior of coupled oscillators. In order to speed
up the simulation of coupled oscillator systems, we propose a simplified phase
model to perform phase and frequency synchronization prediction based on a
synthesis of earlier models. Our model can predict the frequency locking
behavior with several orders of magnitude speedup compared to direct
evaluation, enabling the effective and efficient simulation of the large
numbers of oscillators required for practical computing systems.
"
519,"Quantitative evaluation of the performance of discrete-time reservoir
  computers in the forecasting, filtering, and reconstruction of stochastic
  stationary signals","  This paper extends the notion of information processing capacity for
non-independent input signals in the context of reservoir computing (RC). The
presence of input autocorrelation makes worthwhile the treatment of forecasting
and filtering problems for which we explicitly compute this generalized
capacity as a function of the reservoir parameter values using a streamlined
model. The reservoir model leading to these developments is used to show that,
whenever that approximation is valid, this computational paradigm satisfies the
so called separation and fading memory properties that are usually associated
with good information processing performances. We show that several standard
memory, forecasting, and filtering problems that appear in the parametric
stochastic time series context can be readily formulated and tackled via RC
which, as we show, significantly outperforms standard techniques in some
instances.
"
520,"Proving the Turing Universality of Oritatami Co-Transcriptional Folding
  (Full Text)","  We study the oritatami model for molecular co-transcriptional folding. In
oritatami systems, the transcript (the ""molecule"") folds as it is synthesized
(transcribed), according to a local energy optimisation process, which is
similar to how actual biomolecules such as RNA fold into complex shapes and
functions as they are transcribed. We prove that there is an oritatami system
embedding universal computation in the folding process itself.
  Our result relies on the development of a generic toolbox, which is easily
reusable for future work to design complex functions in oritatami systems. We
develop ""low-level"" tools that allow to easily spread apart the encoding of
different ""functions"" in the transcript, even if they are required to be
applied at the same geometrical location in the folding. We build upon these
low-level tools, a programming framework with increasing levels of abstraction,
from encoding of instructions into the transcript to logical analysis. This
framework is similar to the hardware-to-algorithm levels of abstractions in
standard algorithm theory. These various levels of abstractions allow to
separate the proof of correctness of the global behavior of our system, from
the proof of correctness of its implementation. Thanks to this framework, we
were able to computerize the proof of correctness of its implementation and
produce certificates, in the form of a relatively small number of proof trees,
compact and easily readable and checkable by human, while encapsulating huge
case enumerations. We believe this particular type of certificates can be
generalized to other discrete dynamical systems, where proofs involve large
case enumerations as well.
"
521,Queuing models for abstracting interactions in Bacterial communities,"  Microbial communities play a significant role in bioremediation,plant
growth,human and animal digestion,global elemental cycles including the
carbon-cycle,and water treatment.They are also posed to be the engines of
renewable energy via microbial fuel cells which can reverse the process of
electrosynthesis.Microbial communication regulates many virulence mechanisms
used by bacteria.Thus,it is of fundamental importance to understand
interactions in microbial communities and to develop predictive tools that help
control them,in order to aid the design of systems exploiting bacterial
capabilities.This position paper explores how abstractions from
communications,networking and information theory can play a role in
understanding and modeling bacterial interactions.In particular,two forms of
interactions in bacterial systems will be examined:electron transfer and quorum
sensing.While the diffusion of chemical signals has been heavily
studied,electron transfer occurring in living cells and its role in cell-cell
interaction is less understood.Recent experimental observations open up new
frontiers in the design of microbial systems based on electron transfer,which
may coexist with the more well-known interaction strategies based on molecular
diffusion.In quorum sensing,the concentration of certain signature chemical
compounds emitted by the bacteria is used to estimate the bacterial population
size,so as to activate collective behaviors.In this position paper,queuing
models for electron transfer are summarized and adapted to provide new models
for quorum sensing.These models are stochastic,and thus capture the inherent
randomness exhibited by cell colonies in nature.It is shown that queuing models
allow the characterization of the state of a single cell as a function of
interactions with other cells and the environment,while being amenable to
complexity reduction.
"
522,"Improving Reliability Performance of Diffusion-based Molecular
  Communication With Adaptive Threshold Variation Algorithm","  In this work, we investigate the communication reliability for
diffusion-based molecular communication, using the indicator of bit error rate
(BER). A molecular classified model is established to divide molecules into
three parts, which are the signal, inter-symbol interference (ISI) and noise.
We expand each part separately using molecular absorbing probability, and
connect them by a traditional-like formula. Based on the classified model, we
do a theoretical analysis to prove the feasibility of improving the BER
performance. Accordingly, an adaptive threshold variation (ATV) algorithm is
designed in demodulation to implement the goal, which makes the receiver adapt
the channel condition properly through learning process. Moreover, the
complexity of ATV is calculated and its performance in various noisy channel is
discussed. An expression of Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio (SINR) is
defined to verify the system performance. We test some important parameters of
the channel model, as well as the ATV algorithm in the simulation section. The
results have shown the performance gain of the proposal.
"
523,Cable Capacitance Attack against the KLJN Secure Key Exchange,"  The security of the Kirchhoff-law-Johnson-(like)-noise (KLJN) key exchange
system is based on the Fluctuation-Dissipation-Theorem of classical statistical
physics. Similarly to quantum key distribution, in practical situations, due to
the non-idealities of the building elements, there is a small information leak,
which can be mitigated by privacy amplification or other techniques so that the
unconditional (information theoretic) security is preserved. In this paper, the
industrial cable and circuit simulator LTSPICE is used to validate the
information leak due to one of the non-idealities in KLJN, the parasitic
(cable) capacitance. Simulation results show that privacy amplification and/or
capacitor killer (capacitance compensation) arrangements can effectively
eliminate the leak.
"
524,Logical N-AND Gate on a Molecular Turing Machine,"  In Boolean algebra, it is known that the logical function that corresponds to
the negation of the conjunction --NAND-- is universal in the sense that any
other logical function can be built based on it. This property makes it
essential to modern digital electronics and computer processor design. Here, we
design a molecular Turing machine that computes the NAND function over binary
strings of arbitrary length. For this purpose, we will perform a mathematical
abstraction of the kind of operations that can be done over a double-stranded
DNA molecule, as well as presenting a molecular encoding of the input symbols
for such a machine.
"
525,"On the advantages of using relative phase Toffolis with an application
  to multiple control Toffoli optimization","  Various implementations of the Toffoli gate up to a relative phase have been
known for years. The advantage over regular Toffoli gate is their smaller
circuit size. However, their use has been often limited to a demonstration of
quantum control in designs such as those where the Toffoli gate is being
applied last or otherwise for some specific reasons the relative phase does not
matter. It was commonly believed that the relative phase deviations would
prevent the relative phase Toffolis from being very helpful in practical
large-scale designs.
  In this paper, we report three circuit identities that provide the means for
replacing certain configurations of the multiple control Toffoli gates with
their simpler relative phase implementations, up to a selectable unitary on
certain qubits, and without changing the overall functionality. We illustrate
the advantage via applying those identities to the optimization of the known
circuits implementing multiple control Toffoli gates, and report the reductions
in the CNOT-count, T-count, as well as the number of ancillae used. We suggest
that a further study of the relative phase Toffoli implementations and their
use may yield other optimizations.
"
526,"Synthesizing and tuning chemical reaction networks with specified
  behaviours","  We consider how to generate chemical reaction networks (CRNs) from functional
specifications. We propose a two-stage approach that combines synthesis by
satisfiability modulo theories and Markov chain Monte Carlo based optimisation.
First, we identify candidate CRNs that have the possibility to produce correct
computations for a given finite set of inputs. We then optimise the reaction
rates of each CRN using a combination of stochastic search techniques applied
to the chemical master equation, simultaneously improving the of correct
behaviour and ruling out spurious solutions. In addition, we use techniques
from continuous time Markov chain theory to study the expected termination time
for each CRN. We illustrate our approach by identifying CRNs for majority
decision-making and division computation, which includes the identification of
both known and unknown networks.
"
527,"On the Physical Design of Molecular Communication Receiver Based on
  Nanoscale Biosensors","  Molecular communications (MC), where molecules are used to encode, transmit,
and receive information, is a promising means of enabling the coordination of
nanoscale devices. The paradigm has been extensively studied from various
aspects, including channel modeling and noise analysis. Comparatively little
attention has been given to the physical design of molecular receiver and
transmitter, envisioning biological synthetic cells with intrinsic molecular
reception and transmission capabilities as the future nanomachines. However,
this assumption leads to a discrepancy between the envisaged applications
requiring complex communication interfaces and protocols, and the very limited
computational capacities of the envisioned biological nanomachines. In this
paper, we examine the feasibility of designing a molecular receiver, in a
physical domain other than synthetic biology, meeting the basic requirements of
nanonetwork applications. We first review the state-of-the-art biosensing
approaches to determine whether they can inspire a receiver design. We reveal
that nanoscale field effect transistor based electrical biosensor technology
(bioFET) is a particularly useful starting point for designing a molecular
receiver. Focusing on bioFET-based molecular receivers with a conceptual
approach, we provide a guideline elaborating on their operation principles,
performance metrics and design parameters. We then provide a simple model for
signal flow in silicon nanowire (SiNW) FET-based molecular receiver. Lastly, we
discuss the practical challenges of implementing the receiver and present the
future research avenues from a communication theoretical perspective.
"
528,Synthesis of Linear Nearest Neighbor Quantum Circuits,"  This paper presents models for transforming standard reversible circuits into
Linear Nearest Neighbor (LNN) architecture without inserting SWAP gates.
Templates to optimize the transformed LNN circuits are proposed. All minimal
LNN circuits for all 3-qubit functions have been generated to serve as
benchmarks to evaluate heuristic optimization algorithms. The minimal results
generated are compared with optimized LNN circuits obtained from the post
synthesis algorithm --- template matching with LNN templates. Experiments show
that the suggested synthesis flow significantly improves the quantum cost of
circuits.
"
529,"Low-complexity Non-coherent Signal Detection for Nano-Scale Molecular
  Communications","  Nano-scale molecular communication is a viable way of exchanging information
between nano-machines. In this letter, a low-complexity and non-coherent signal
detection technique is proposed to mitigate the inter-symbol-interference (ISI)
and additive noise. In contrast to existing coherent detection methods of high
complexity, the proposed non-coherent signal detector is more practical when
the channel conditions are hard to acquire accurately or hidden from the
receiver. The proposed scheme employs the concentration difference to detect
the ISI corrupted signals and we demonstrate that it can suppress the ISI
effectively. The concentration difference is a stable characteristic,
irrespective of the diffusion channel conditions. In terms of complexity, by
excluding matrix operations or likelihood calculations, the new detection
scheme is particularly suitable for nano-scale molecular communication systems
with a small energy budget or limited computation resource.
"
530,Bounds on the Capacity of ASK Molecular Communication Channels with ISI,"  There are now several works on the use of the additive inverse Gaussian noise
(AIGN) model for the random transit time in molecular communication~(MC)
channels. The randomness invariably causes inter-symbol interference (ISI) in
MC, an issue largely ignored or simplified. In this paper we derive an upper
bound and two lower bounds for MC based on amplitude shift keying (ASK) in
presence of ISI. The Blahut-Arimoto algorithm~(BAA) is modified to find the
input distribution of transmitted symbols to maximize the lower bounds. Our
results show that over wide parameter values the bounds are close.
"
531,"In-Line-Test of Variability and Bit-Error-Rate of HfOx-Based Resistive
  Memory","  Spatial and temporal variability of HfOx-based resistive random access memory
(RRAM) are investigated for manufacturing and product designs. Manufacturing
variability is characterized at different levels including lots, wafers, and
chips. Bit-error-rate (BER) is proposed as a holistic parameter for the write
cycle resistance statistics. Using the electrical in-line-test cycle data, a
method is developed to derive BERs as functions of the design margin, to
provide guidance for technology evaluation and product design. The proposed BER
calculation can also be used in the off-line bench test and build-in-self-test
(BIST) for adaptive error correction and for the other types of random access
memories.
"
532,Improved bounded-strength decoupling schemes for local Hamiltonians,"  We address the task of switching off the Hamiltonian of a system by removing
all internal and system-environment couplings. We propose dynamical decoupling
schemes, that use only bounded-strength controls, for quantum many-body systems
with local system Hamiltonians and local environmental couplings. To do so, we
introduce the combinatorial concept of balanced-cycle orthogonal arrays (BOAs)
and show how to construct them from classical error-correcting codes. The
derived decoupling schemes may be useful as a primitive for more complex
schemes, e.g., for Hamiltonian simulation. For the case of $n$ qubits and a
$2$-local Hamiltonian, the length of the resulting decoupling scheme scales as
$O(n \log n)$, improving over the previously best-known schemes that scaled
quadratically with $n$. More generally, using balanced-cycle orthogonal arrays
constructed from families of BCH codes, we show that bounded-strength
decoupling for any $\ell$-local Hamiltonian, where $\ell \geq 2$, can be
achieved using decoupling schemes of length at most $O(n^{\ell-1} \log n)$.
"
533,"Exploiting Challenges of Sub-20 nm CMOS for Affordable Technology
  Scaling","  For the past four decades, cost and features have driven CMOS scaling. Severe
lithography and material limitations seen below the 20 nm node, however, are
challenging the fundamental premise of affordable CMOS scaling. Just continuing
to co-optimize leaf cell circuit and layout designs with process technology
does not enable us to exploit the challenges of a sub-20 nm CMOS. For
affordable scaling it is imperative to work past sub-20 nm technology
impediments while exploiting its features. To this end, we propose to broaden
the scope of design technology co-optimization (DTCO) to be more holistic by
including micro-architecture design and CAD, along with circuits, layout and
process technology. Applying such holistic DTCO to the most significant block
in a system-on-chip (SoC), embedded memory, we can synthesize smarter and
efficient embedded memory blocks that are customized to application needs.
  To evaluate the efficacy of the proposed holistic DTCO process, we designed,
fabricated and tested several design experiments in a state-of-the-art IBM
14SOI process. DTCOed leaf cells, standard cells and SRAM bitcells were robust
during testing, but failed to meet node to node area scaling requirements.
Holistic DTCO, when applied to a widely used parallel access SRAM sub-block,
consumed 25% less area with a 50% better performance per watt compared to a
traditional implementation using compiled SRAM blocks and standard cells. To
extend the benefits of holistic DTCO to other embedded memory intensive
sub-blocks in SoCs, we developed a readily customizable smart memory synthesis
framework (SMSF). We believe that such an approach is important to establish an
affordable path for sub-20 nm scaling.
"
534,Analog Computing Using Graphene-based Metalines,"  We introduce the new concept of ""metalines"" for manipulating the amplitude
and phase profile of an incident wave locally and independently. Thanks to the
highly confined graphene plasmons, a transmit-array of graphene-based metalines
is used to realize analog computing on an ultra-compact, integrable and planar
platform. By employing the general concepts of spatial Fourier transformation,
a well-designed structure of such meta-transmit-array combined with graded
index lenses can perform two mathematical operations; i.e. differentiation and
integration, with high efficiency. The presented configuration is about 60
times shorter than the recent structure proposed by Silva et al.(Science, 2014,
343, 160-163); moreover, our simulated output responses are in more agreement
with the desired analytic results. These findings may lead to remarkable
achievements in light-based plasmonic signal processors at nanoscale instead of
their bulky conventional dielectric lens-based counterparts.
"
535,Emulating long-term synaptic dynamics with memristive devices,"  The potential of memristive devices is often seeing in implementing
neuromorphic architectures for achieving brain-like computation. However, the
designing procedures do not allow for extended manipulation of the material,
unlike CMOS technology, the properties of the memristive material should be
harnessed in the context of such computation, under the view that biological
synapses are memristors. Here we demonstrate that single solid-state TiO2
memristors can exhibit associative plasticity phenomena observed in biological
cortical synapses, and are captured by a phenomenological plasticity model
called triplet rule. This rule comprises of a spike-timing dependent plasticity
regime and a classical hebbian associative regime, and is compatible with a
large amount of electrophysiology data. Via a set of experiments with our
artificial, memristive, synapses we show that, contrary to conventional uses of
solid-state memory, the co-existence of field- and thermally-driven switching
mechanisms that could render bipolar and/or unipolar programming modes is a
salient feature for capturing long-term potentiation and depression synaptic
dynamics. We further demonstrate that the non-linear accumulating nature of
memristors promotes long-term potentiating or depressing memory transitions.
"
536,"Solving NP-complete problems with delayed signals: an overview of
  current research directions","  In this paper we summarize the existing principles for building
unconventional computing devices that involve delayed signals for encoding
solutions to NP-complete problems. We are interested in the following aspects:
the properties of the signal, the operations performed within the devices, some
components required for the physical implementation, precision required for
correctly reading the solution and the decrease in the signal's strength. Six
problems have been solved so far by using the above enumerated principles:
Hamiltonian path, travelling salesman, bounded and unbounded subset sum,
Diophantine equations and exact cover. For the hardware implementation several
types of signals can be used: light, electric power, sound, electro-magnetic
etc.
"
537,Three-Dimensional Stateful Material Implication Logic,"  Monolithic three-dimensional integration of memory and logic circuits could
dramatically improve performance and energy efficiency of computing systems.
Some conventional and emerging memories are suitable for vertical integration,
including highly scalable metal-oxide resistive switching devices (memristors),
yet integration of logic circuits proves to be much more challenging. Here we
demonstrate memory and logic functionality in a monolithic three-dimensional
circuit by adapting recently proposed memristor-based stateful material
implication logic. Though such logic has been already implemented with a
variety of memory devices, prohibitively large device variability in the most
prospective memristor-based circuits has limited experimental demonstrations to
simple gates and just a few cycles of operations. By developing a
low-temperature, low-variability fabrication process, and modifying the
original circuit to increase its robustness to device imperfections, we
experimentally show, for the first time, reliable multi-cycle multi-gate
material implication logic operation within a three-dimensional stack of
monolithically integrated memristors. The direct data manipulation in three
dimensions enables extremely compact and high-throughput logic-in-memory
computing and, remarkably, presents a viable solution for the Feynman grand
challenge of implementing an 8-bit adder at the nanoscale.

538,"Modeling Quantum Optical Components, Pulses and Fiber Channels Using
  OMNeT++","  Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is an innovative technology which exploits the
laws of quantum mechanics to generate and distribute unconditionally secure
cryptographic keys. While QKD offers the promise of unconditionally secure key
distribution, real world systems are built from non-ideal components which
necessitates the need to model and understand the impact these non-idealities
have on system performance and security. OMNeT++ has been used as a basis to
develop a simulation framework to support this endeavor. This framework,
referred to as ""qkdX"" extends OMNeT++'s module and message abstractions to
efficiently model optical components, optical pulses, operating protocols and
processes. This paper presents the design of this framework including how
OMNeT++'s abstractions have been utilized to model quantum optical components,
optical pulses, fiber and free space channels. Furthermore, from our toolbox of
created components, we present various notional and real QKD systems, which
have been studied and analyzed.

539,"Feasible methodology for optimization of a novel reversible binary
  compressor","  Now a day reversible logic is an attractive research area due to its low
power consumption in the area of VLSI circuit design. The reversible logic gate
is utilized to optimize power consumption by a feature of retrieving input
logic from an output logic because of bijective mapping between input and
output. In this manuscript, we design 4 2 and 5 2 reversible compressor
circuits using a new type of reversible gate. In addition, we propose new gate,
named as inventive0 gate for optimizing a compressor circuit. The utility of
the inventive0 gate is that it can be used as full adder and full subtraction
with low value of garbage outputs and quantum cost. An algorithm is shown for
designing a compressor structure. The comparative study shows that the proposed
compressor structure outperforms the existing ones in terms of garbage outputs,
number of gates and quantum cost. The compressor can reduce the effect of carry
(Produce from full adder) of the arithmetic frame design. In addition, we
implement a basic reversible gate of MOS transistor with less number of MOS
transistor count.
"
540,"Evolution of structure of some binary group based n bit comparator,
  n-to-2n decoder by reversible technique","  Reversible logic has attracted substantial interest due to its low power
consumption which is the main concern of low power VLSI circuit design. In this
paper, a novel 4x4 reversible gate called inventive gate has been introduced
and using this gate 1-bit, 2-bit, 8-bit, 32-bit and n-bit group-based
reversible comparator have been constructed with low value of reversible
parameters. The MOS transistor realizations of 1-bit, 2- bit, and 8-bit of
reversible comparator are also presented and finding power, delay and power
delay product (PDP) with appropriate aspect ratio W/L. Novel inventive gate has
the ability to use as an n-to-2n decoder. Different proposed novel reversible
circuit design style is compared with the existing ones. The relative results
shows that the novel reversible gate wide utility, group-based reversible
comparator outperforms the present design style in terms of number of gates,
garbage outputs and constant input.
"
541,"Solving constrained quadratic binary problems via quantum adiabatic
  evolution","  Quantum adiabatic evolution is perceived as useful for binary quadratic
programming problems that are a priori unconstrained. For constrained problems,
it is a common practice to relax linear equality constraints as penalty terms
in the objective function. However, there has not yet been proposed a method
for efficiently dealing with inequality constraints using the quantum adiabatic
approach. In this paper, we give a method for solving the Lagrangian dual of a
binary quadratic programming (BQP) problem in the presence of inequality
constraints and employ this procedure within a branch-and-bound framework for
constrained BQP (CBQP) problems.
"
542,"Size-Dependent Tile Self-Assembly: Constant-Height Rectangles and
  Stability","  We introduce a new model of algorithmic tile self-assembly called
size-dependent assembly. In previous models, supertiles are stable when the
total strength of the bonds between any two halves exceeds some constant
temperature. In this model, this constant temperature requirement is replaced
by an nondecreasing temperature function $\tau : \mathbb{N} \rightarrow
\mathbb{N}$ that depends on the size of the smaller of the two halves. This
generalization allows supertiles to become unstable and break apart, and
captures the increased forces that large structures may place on the bonds
holding them together.
  We demonstrate the power of this model in two ways. First, we give fixed tile
sets that assemble constant-height rectangles and squares of arbitrary input
size given an appropriate temperature function. Second, we prove that deciding
whether a supertile is stable is coNP-complete. Both results contrast with
known results for fixed temperature.
"
543,"Random-resistor-random-temperature Kirchhoff-law-Johnson-noise
  (RRRT-KLJN) key exchange","  We introduce two new Kirchhoff-law-Johnson-noise (KLJN) secure key
distribution schemes which are generalizations of the original KLJN scheme. The
first of these, the Random-Resistor (RR-) KLJN scheme, uses random resistors
with values chosen from a quasi-continuum set. It is well-known since the
creation of the KLJN concept that such a system could work in cryptography,
because Alice and Bob can calculate the unknown resistance value from
measurements, but the RR-KLJN system has not been addressed in prior
publications since it was considered impractical. The reason for discussing it
now is the second scheme, the Random-Resistor-Random-Temperature (RRRT-) KLJN
key exchange, inspired by a recent paper of Vadai, Mingesz and Gingl, wherein
security was shown to be maintained at non-zero power flow. In the RRRT-KLJN
secure key exchange scheme, both the resistances and their temperatures are
continuum random variables. We prove that the security of the RRRT-KLJN scheme
can prevail at non-zero power flow, and thus the physical law guaranteeing
security is not the Second Law of Thermodynamics but the
Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem. Alice and Bob know their own resistances and
temperatures and can calculate the resistance and temperature values at the
other end of the communication channel from measured voltage, current and
power-flow data in the wire. However, Eve cannot determine these values
because, for her, there are four unknown quantities while she can set up only
three equations. The RRRT-KLJN scheme has several advantages and makes all
former attacks on the KLJN scheme invalid or incomplete.
"
544,A Nonlinear HP-Type Complementary Resistive Switch,"  Resistive Switching (RS) is the change in resistance of a dielectric under
the influence of an external current or electric field. This change is
non-volatile, and the basis of both the memristor and resistive random access
memory. In the latter, high integration densities favor the anti-serial
combination of two RS-elements to a single cell, termed the complementary
resistive switch (CRS). Motivated by the irregular shape of the filament
protruding into the device, we suggest a nonlinearity in the
resistance-interpolation function, and thereby expand the original
HP-memristor. We numerically simulate and analytically solve this model.
Further, the nonlinearity allows for its application to the CRS.

545,"On Boosting the Throughput with Minimal Emitted No. of Molecules for the
  Diffusion-Based Molecular Communication networks: Prospective and Challenges","  It is assumed that each nano-robot has a 0.1 micrometers cubed of tankage
which is far smaller than the volume of a human red blood cell[6]. Thus, the
nano-machines are non-invasive for biomedical applications, such as drug
delivery and disease diagnosis. Since the nano-machine has an initial source of
108 molecules in its own tankage and since the throughput of the DMC systems is
significantly low; we propose and discuss some ideas to boost the throughput
with emphasize of reducing the emitted no. of molecules per message.
"
546,Reversible circuit compilation with space constraints,"  We develop a framework for resource efficient compilation of higher-level
programs into lower-level reversible circuits. Our main focus is on optimizing
the memory footprint of the resulting reversible networks. This is motivated by
the limited availability of qubits for the foreseeable future. We apply three
main techniques to keep the number of required qubits small when computing
classical, irreversible computations by means of reversible networks: first,
wherever possible we allow the compiler to make use of in-place functions to
modify some of the variables. Second, an intermediate representation is
introduced that allows to trace data dependencies within the program, allowing
to clean up qubits early. This realizes an analog to ""garbage collection"" for
reversible circuits. Third, we use the concept of so-called pebble games to
transform irreversible programs into reversible programs under space
constraints, allowing for data to be erased and recomputed if needed.
  We introduce REVS, a compiler for reversible circuits that can translate a
subset of the functional programming language F# into Toffoli networks which
can then be further interpreted for instance in LIQui|>, a domain-specific
language for quantum computing and which is also embedded into F#. We discuss a
number of test cases that illustrate the advantages of our approach including
reversible implementations of SHA-2 and other cryptographic hash-functions,
reversible integer arithmetic, as well as a test-bench of combinational
circuits used in classical circuit synthesis. Compared to Bennett's method,
REVS can reduce space complexity by a factor of $4$ or more, while having an
only moderate increase in circuit size as well as in the time it takes to
compile the reversible networks.
"
547,"Hybrid Spintronic-CMOS Spiking Neural Network With On-Chip Learning:
  Devices, Circuits and Systems","  Over the past decade Spiking Neural Networks (SNN) have emerged as one of the
popular architectures to emulate the brain. In SNN, information is temporally
encoded and communication between neurons is accomplished by means of spikes.
In such networks, spike-timing dependent plasticity mechanisms require the
online programming of synapses based on the temporal information of spikes
transmitted by spiking neurons. In this work, we propose a spintronic synapse
with decoupled spike transmission and programming current paths. The spintronic
synapse consists of a ferromagnet-heavy metal heterostructure where programming
current through the heavy metal generates spin-orbit torque to modulate the
device conductance. Low programming energy and fast programming times
demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed device as a nanoelectronic synapse. We
perform a simulation study based on an experimentally benchmarked
device-simulation framework to demonstrate the interfacing of such spintronic
synapses with CMOS neurons and learning circuits operating in transistor
sub-threshold region to form a network of spiking neurons that can be utilized
for pattern recognition problems.
"
548,Magnetic Tunnel Junction Mimics Stochastic Cortical Spiking Neurons,"  Brain-inspired computing architectures attempt to mimic the computations
performed in the neurons and the synapses in the human brain in order to
achieve its efficiency in learning and cognitive tasks. In this work, we
demonstrate the mapping of the probabilistic spiking nature of pyramidal
neurons in the cortex to the stochastic switching behavior of a Magnetic Tunnel
Junction in presence of thermal noise. We present results to illustrate the
efficiency of neuromorphic systems based on such probabilistic neurons for
pattern recognition tasks in presence of lateral inhibition and homeostasis.
Such stochastic MTJ neurons can also potentially provide a direct mapping to
the probabilistic computing elements in Belief Networks for performing
regenerative tasks.
"
549,"Proposal for an All-Spin Artificial Neural Network: Emulating Neural and
  Synaptic Functionalities Through Domain Wall Motion in Ferromagnets","  Non-Boolean computing based on emerging post-CMOS technologies can
potentially pave the way for low-power neural computing platforms. However,
existing work on such emerging neuromorphic architectures have either focused
on solely mimicking the neuron, or the synapse functionality. While memristive
devices have been proposed to emulate biological synapses, spintronic devices
have proved to be efficient at performing the thresholding operation of the
neuron at ultra-low currents. In this work, we propose an All-Spin Artificial
Neural Network where a single spintronic device acts as the basic building
block of the system. The device offers a direct mapping to synapse and neuron
functionalities in the brain while inter-layer network communication is
accomplished via CMOS transistors. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first demonstration of a neural architecture where a single nanoelectronic
device is able to mimic both neurons and synapses. The ultra-low voltage
operation of low resistance magneto-metallic neurons enables the low-voltage
operation of the array of spintronic synapses, thereby leading to ultra-low
power neural architectures. Device-level simulations, calibrated to
experimental results, was used to drive the circuit and system level
simulations of the neural network for a standard pattern recognition problem.
Simulation studies indicate energy savings by ~ 100x in comparison to a
corresponding digital/ analog CMOS neuron implementation.
"
550,Abstraction/Representation Theory for Heterotic Physical Computing,"  We give a rigorous framework for the interaction of physical computing
devices with abstract computation. Device and program are mediated by the
non-logical 'representation relation'; we give the conditions under which
representation and device theory give rise to commuting diagrams between
logical and physical domains, and the conditions for computation to occur. We
give the interface of this new framework with currently existing formal
methods, showing in particular its close relationship to refinement theory, and
the implications for questions of meaning and reference in theoretical computer
science. The case of hybrid computing is considered in detail, addressing in
particular the example of an internet-mediated 'social machine', and the
abstraction/representation framework used to provide a formal distinction
between heterotic and hybrid computing. This forms the basis for future use of
the framework in formal treatments of nonstandard physical computers.
"
551,"Optimal Relay Probing in Millimeter Wave Cellular Systems with
  Device-to-Device Relaying","  Millimeter-wave (mmWave) cellular systems are power-limited and susceptible
to blockages. As a result, mmWave connectivity will be likely to be
intermittent. One promising approach to increasing mmWave connectivity and
range is to use relays. Device-to-device (D2D) communications open the door to
the vast opportunities of D2D and device-to-network relaying for mmWave
cellular systems. In this correspondence, we study how to select a good relay
for a given source-destination pair in a two-hop mmWave cellular system, where
the mmWave links are subject to random Bernoulli blockages. In such a system,
probing more relays could potentially lead to the discovery of a better relay
but at the cost of more overhead. We find that the throughput-optimal relay
probing strategy is a pure threshold policy: the system can stop relay probing
once the achievable spectral efficiency of the currently probed two-hop link
exceeds some threshold. In general, the spectral efficiency threshold can be
obtained by solving a fixed point equation. For the special case with on/off
mmWave links, we derive a closed-form solution for the threshold. Numerical
results demonstrate that the threshold-based relay probing strategy can yield
remarkable throughput gains.
"
552,"Modeling and Analysis of SiNW BioFET as Molecular Antenna for Bio-Cyber
  Interfaces towards the Internet of Bio-NanoThings","  Seamless connection of molecular nanonetworks to macroscale cyber networks is
envisioned to enable the Internet of Bio-NanoThings, which promises for
cutting-edge applications, especially in the medical domain. The connection
requires the development of an interface between the biochemical domain of
molecular nanonetworks and the electrical domain of conventional
electromagnetic networks. To this aim, in this paper, we propose to exploit
field effect transistor based biosensors (bioFETs) to devise a molecular
antenna capable of transducing molecular messages into electrical signals. In
particular, focusing on the use of SiNW FET-based biosensors as molecular
antennas, we develop deterministic and noise models for the antenna operation
to provide a theoretical framework for the optimization of the device from
communication perspective. We numerically evaluate the performance of the
antenna in terms of the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) at the electrical output.
"
553,A Framework for Approximating Qubit Unitaries,"  We present an algorithm for efficiently approximating of qubit unitaries over
gate sets derived from totally definite quaternion algebras. It achieves
$\varepsilon$-approximations using circuits of length $O(\log(1/\varepsilon))$,
which is asymptotically optimal. The algorithm achieves the same quality of
approximation as previously-known algorithms for Clifford+T [arXiv:1212.6253],
V-basis [arXiv:1303.1411] and Clifford+$\pi/12$ [arXiv:1409.3552], running on
average in time polynomial in $O(\log(1/\varepsilon))$ (conditional on a
number-theoretic conjecture). Ours is the first such algorithm that works for a
wide range of gate sets and provides insight into what should constitute a
""good"" gate set for a fault-tolerant quantum computer.
"
554,Optimal Staged Self-Assembly of General Shapes,"  We analyze the number of tile types $t$, bins $b$, and stages necessary to
assemble $n \times n$ squares and scaled shapes in the staged tile assembly
model. For $n \times n$ squares, we prove $\mathcal{O}(\frac{\log{n} - tb -
t\log t}{b^2} + \frac{\log \log b}{\log t})$ stages suffice and
$\Omega(\frac{\log{n} - tb - t\log t}{b^2})$ are necessary for almost all $n$.
For shapes $S$ with Kolmogorov complexity $K(S)$, we prove
$\mathcal{O}(\frac{K(S) - tb - t\log t}{b^2} + \frac{\log \log b}{\log t})$
stages suffice and $\Omega(\frac{K(S) - tb - t\log t}{b^2})$ are necessary to
assemble a scaled version of $S$, for almost all $S$. We obtain similarly tight
bounds when the more powerful flexible glues are permitted.
"
555,"Satellite Quantum Communication via the Alphasat Laser Communication
  Terminal","  By harnessing quantum effects, we nowadays can use encryption that is in
principle proven to withstand any conceivable attack. These fascinating quantum
features have been implemented in metropolitan quantum networks around the
world. In order to interconnect such networks over long distances, optical
satellite communication is the method of choice. Standard telecommunication
components allow one to efficiently implement quantum communication by
measuring field quadratures (continuous variables). This opens the possibility
to adapt our Laser Communication Terminals (LCTs) to quantum key distribution
(QKD). First satellite measurement campaigns are currently validating our
approach.
"
556,Energy Model for Vesicle-Based Active Transport Molecular Communication,"  In active transport molecular communication (ATMC), information particles are
actively transported from a transmitter to a receiver using special proteins.
Prior work has demonstrated that ATMC can be an attractive and viable solution
for on-chip applications. The energy consumption of an ATMC system plays a
central role in its design and engineering. In this work, an energy model is
presented for ATMC and the model is used to provide guidelines for designing
energy efficient systems. The channel capacity per unit energy is analyzed and
maximized. It is shown that based on the size of the symbol set and the symbol
duration, there is a vesicle size that maximizes rate per unit energy. It is
also demonstrated that maximizing rate per unit energy yields very different
system parameters compared to maximizing the rate only.
"
557,Single Memristor Logic Gates: From NOT to a Full Adder,"  Memristors have been suggested as a novel route to neuromorphic computing
based on the similarity between them and neurons (specifically synapses and ion
pumps). The d.c. action of the memristor is a current spike which imparts a
short-term memory to the device. Here it is demonstrated that this short-term
memory works exactly like habituation (e.g. in \emph{Aplysia}). We elucidate
the physical rules, based on energy conservation, governing the interaction of
these current spikes: summation, `bounce-back', directionality and `diminishing
returns'. Using these rules, we introduce 4 different logical systems to
implement sequential logic in the memristor and demonstrate how sequential
logic works by instantiating a NOT gate, an AND gate, an XOR gate and a Full
Adder with a single memristor. The Full Adder makes use of the memristor's
short-term memory to add together three binary values and outputs the sum, the
carry digit and even the order they were input in. A memristor full adder also
outputs the arithmetical sum of bits, allowing for a logically (but not
physically) reversible system. Essentially, we can replace an input/output port
with an extra time-step, allowing a single memristor to do a hither-to
unexpectedly large amount of computation. This makes up for the memristor's
slow operation speed and may relate to how neurons do a similarly-large
computation with such slow operations speeds. We propose that using spiking
logic, either in gates or as neuron-analogues, with plastic rewritable
connections between them, would allow the building of a neuromorphic computer.
"
558,"Proton Conducting Graphene Oxide Coupled Neuron Transistors for
  Brain-Inspired Cognitive Systems","  Neuron is the most important building block in our brain, and information
processing in individual neuron involves the transformation of input synaptic
spike trains into an appropriate output spike train. Hardware implementation of
neuron by individual ionic/electronic hybrid device is of great significance
for enhancing our understanding of the brain and solving sensory processing and
complex recognition tasks. Here, we provide a proof-of-principle artificial
neuron based on a proton conducting graphene oxide (GO) coupled oxide-based
electric-double-layer (EDL) transistor with multiple driving inputs and one
modulatory input terminal. Paired-pulse facilitation, dendritic integration and
orientation tuning were successfully emulated. Additionally, neuronal gain
control (arithmetic) in the scheme of rate coding is also experimentally
demonstrated. Our results provide a new-concept approach for building
brain-inspired cognitive systems.
"
559,"Random Projections through multiple optical scattering: Approximating
  kernels at the speed of light","  Random projections have proven extremely useful in many signal processing and
machine learning applications. However, they often require either to store a
very large random matrix, or to use a different, structured matrix to reduce
the computational and memory costs. Here, we overcome this difficulty by
proposing an analog, optical device, that performs the random projections
literally at the speed of light without having to store any matrix in memory.
This is achieved using the physical properties of multiple coherent scattering
of coherent light in random media. We use this device on a simple task of
classification with a kernel machine, and we show that, on the MNIST database,
the experimental results closely match the theoretical performance of the
corresponding kernel. This framework can help make kernel methods practical for
applications that have large training sets and/or require real-time prediction.
We discuss possible extensions of the method in terms of a class of kernels,
speed, memory consumption and different problems.
"
560,Modeling and Analysis of SiNW FET-Based Molecular Communication Receiver,"  Molecular Communication (MC) is a bio-inspired communication method based on
the exchange of molecules for information transfer among nanoscale devices. MC
has been extensively studied from various aspects in the literature; however,
the physical design of MC transceiving units is largely neglected with the
assumption that network nodes are entirely biological devices, e.g., engineered
bacteria, which are intrinsically capable of receiving and transmitting
molecular messages. However, the low information processing capacity of
biological devices and the challenge to interface them with macroscale networks
hinder the true application potential of nanonetworks. To overcome this
problem, recently, we proposed a nanobioelectronic MC receiver architecture
exploiting the nanoscale field effect transistor-based biosensor (bioFET)
technology, which provides noninvasive and sensitive molecular detection while
producing electrical signals as the output. In this paper, we introduce a
comprehensive model for silicon nanowire (SiNW) FET-based MC receivers by
integrating the underlying processes in MC and bioFET to provide a unified
analysis framework. We derive closed-form expressions for noise statistics,
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the receiver output, and symbol error
probability (SEP). Performance evaluation in terms of SNR and SEP reveals the
effects of individual system parameters on the detection performance of the
proposed MC receiver.
"
561,"A Bio-Synthetic Modulator Model for Diffusion-based Molecular
  Communications","  In diffusion-based molecular communication (DMC), one important functionality
of a transmitter nano-machine is signal modulation. In particular, the
transmitter has to be able to control the release of signaling molecules for
modulation of the information bits. An important class of control mechanisms in
natural cells for releasing molecules is based on ion channels which are
pore-forming proteins across the cell membrane whose opening and closing may be
controlled by a gating parameter. In this paper, a modulator for DMC based on
ion channels is proposed which controls the rate at which molecules are
released from the transmitter by modulating a gating parameter signal.
Exploiting the capabilities of the proposed modulator, an on-off keying
modulation scheme is introduced and the corresponding average modulated signal,
i.e., the average release rate of the molecules from the transmitter, is
derived in the Laplace domain. By making a simplifying assumption, a
closed-form expression for the average modulated signal in the time domain is
obtained which constitutes an upper bound on the total number of released
molecules regardless of this assumption. The derived average modulated signal
is compared to results obtained with a particle based simulator. The numerical
results show that the derived upper bound is tight if the number of ion
channels distributed across the transmitter (cell) membrane is small.
"
562,"Short-Term Plasticity and Long-Term Potentiation in Magnetic Tunnel
  Junctions: Towards Volatile Synapses","  Synaptic memory is considered to be the main element responsible for learning
and cognition in humans. Although traditionally non-volatile long-term
plasticity changes have been implemented in nanoelectronic synapses for
neuromorphic applications, recent studies in neuroscience have revealed that
biological synapses undergo meta-stable volatile strengthening followed by a
long-term strengthening provided that the frequency of the input stimulus is
sufficiently high. Such ""memory strengthening"" and ""memory decay""
functionalities can potentially lead to adaptive neuromorphic architectures. In
this paper, we demonstrate the close resemblance of the magnetization dynamics
of a Magnetic Tunnel Junction (MTJ) to short-term plasticity and long-term
potentiation observed in biological synapses. We illustrate that, in addition
to the magnitude and duration of the input stimulus, frequency of the stimulus
plays a critical role in determining long-term potentiation of the MTJ. Such
MTJ synaptic memory arrays can be utilized to create compact, ultra-fast and
low power intelligent neural systems.
"
563,Non-deterministic self-assembly of two tile types on a lattice,"  Self-assembly is ubiquitous in nature, particularly in biology, where it
underlies the formation of protein quaternary structure and protein
aggregation. Quaternary structure assembles deterministically and performs a
wide range of important functions in the cell, whereas protein aggregation is
the hallmark of a number of diseases and represents a non-deterministic
self-assembly process. Here we build on previous work on a lattice model of
deterministic self-assembly to investigate non-deterministic self-assembly of
single lattice tiles and mixtures of two tiles at varying relative
concentrations. Despite limiting the simplicity of the model to two interface
types, which results in 13 topologically distinct single tiles and 106
topologically distinct sets of two tiles, we observe a wide variety of
concentration-dependent behaviours. Several two-tile sets display critical
behaviours in form of a sharp transition from bound to unbound structures as
the relative concentration of one tile to another increases. Other sets exhibit
gradual monotonic changes in structural density, or non-monotonic changes,
while again others show no concentration dependence at all. We catalogue this
extensive range of behaviours and present a model that provides a reasonably
good estimate of the critical concentrations for a subset of the critical
transitions. In addition we show that the structures resulting from these tile
sets are fractal, with one of two different fractal dimensions.
"
564,Toward Biochemical Probabilistic Computation,"  Living organisms survive and multiply even though they have uncertain and
incomplete information about their environment and imperfect models to predict
the consequences of their actions. Bayesian models have been proposed to face
this challenge. Indeed, Bayesian inference is a way to do optimal reasoning
when only uncertain and incomplete information is available. Various
perceptive, sensory-motor, and cognitive functions have been successfully
modeled this way. However, the biological mechanisms allowing animals and
humans to represent and to compute probability distributions are not known. It
has been proposed that neurons and assemblies of neurons could be the
appropriate scale to search for clues to probabilistic reasoning. In contrast,
in this paper, we propose that interacting populations of macromolecules and
diffusible messengers can perform probabilistic computation. This suggests that
probabilistic reasoning, based on cellular signaling pathways, is a fundamental
skill of living organisms available to the simplest unicellular organisms as
well as the most complex brains.
"
565,"Software-Based Fault Recovery via Adaptive Diversity for COTS Multi-Core
  Processors","  The ever growing demands of embedded systems to satisfy high computing
performance and cost efficiency lead to the trend of using commercial
off-the-shelf hardware. However, due to their highly integrated design they are
becoming increasingly susceptible to hardware errors (e.g. caused by
radiation-induced soft-errors or wear-out effects). Since such faults cannot be
fully prevented, systems have to cope with their effects. At the same time
there is the trend of multi-core processors in embedded systems. Approaches to
achieve fault tolerance by using the multiple cores to establish redundancy
have been presented in literature. However, typically only homogeneous
redundancy techniques are considered to tolerate soft errors. However, there is
a lack of appropriate reaction mechanisms for restoring the system in case of
permanent hardware faults.
  Here, we propose the basic idea of enhancing multi-core redundancy techniques
with a cost-efficient automated introduction of diversity in the executed
software replicas. Recently, these automated software diversity techniques have
attracted attention in the security domain. We propose to use these techniques
to recover from permanent hardware faults. This is achieved by adapting the
software execution in such a way that permanent faults are mitigated.
"
566,Drawing from hats by noise-based logic,"  We utilize the asymmetric random telegraph wave-based instantaneous
noise-base logic scheme to represent the problem of drawing numbers from a hat,
and we consider two identical hats with the first 2^N integer numbers. In the
first problem, Alice secretly draws an arbitrary number from one of the hats,
and Bob must find out which hat is missing a number. In the second problem,
Alice removes a known number from one of the hats and another known number from
the other hat, and Bob must identify these hats. We show that, when the
preparation of the hats with the numbers is accounted for, the noise-based
logic scheme always provides an exponential speed-up and/or it requires
exponentially smaller computational complexity than deterministic alternatives.
Both the stochasticity and the ability to superpose numbers are essential
components of the exponential improvement.
"
567,High-Performance Computing with Quantum Processing Units,"  The prospects of quantum computing have driven efforts to realize fully
functional quantum processing units (QPUs). Recent success in developing
proof-of-principle QPUs has prompted the question of how to integrate these
emerging processors into modern high-performance computing (HPC) systems. We
examine how QPUs can be integrated into current and future HPC system
architectures by accounting for functional and physical design requirements. We
identify two integration pathways that are differentiated by infrastructure
constraints on the QPU and the use cases expected for the HPC system. This
includes a tight integration that assumes infrastructure bottlenecks can be
overcome as well as a loose integration that assumes they cannot. We find that
the performance of both approaches is likely to depend on the quantum
interconnect that serves to entangle multiple QPUs. We also identify several
challenges in assessing QPU performance for HPC, and we consider new metrics
that capture the interplay between system architecture and the quantum
parallelism underlying computational performance.
"
568,PPV modelling of memristor-based oscillator,"  In this letter, we propose for the first time a method of abstracting the PPV
(Perturbation Projection Vector) characteristic of the up-to-date
memristor-based oscillators. Inspired from biological oscillators and its
characteristic named PRC (Phase Response Curve), we build a bridge between PRC
and PPV. This relationship is verified rigorously using the transistor level
simulation of Colpitts and ring oscillators, i.e., comparing the PPV converted
from PRC and the PPV obtained from accurate PSS+PXF simulation. Then we apply
this method to the PPV calculation of the memristor-based oscillator. By
keeping the phase dynamics of the oscillator and dropping the details of
voltage/current amplitude, the PPV modelling is highly efficient to describe
the phase dynamics due to the oscillator coupling, and will be very suitable
for the fast simulation of large scale oscillatory neural networks.
"
569,Applications of Multi-Agent Slime Mould Computing,"  The giant single-celled slime mould Physarum polycephalum has inspired rapid
develop- ments in unconventional computing substrates since the start of this
century. This is primarily due to its simple component parts and the
distributed nature of the computation which it approximates during its growth,
foraging and adaptation to a changing environment. Slime mould functions as a
living embodied computational material which can be influenced (or pro-
grammed) by the placement of external stimuli. The goal of exploiting this
material behaviour for unconventional computation led to the development of a
multi-agent approach to the ap- proximation of slime mould behaviour. The basis
of the model is a simple dynamical pattern formation mechanism which exhibits
self-organised formation and subsequent adaptation of collective transport
networks. The system exhibits emergent properties such as relaxation and
minimisation and it can be considered as a virtual computing material,
influenced by the external application of spatial concentration gradients. In
this paper we give an overview of this multi-agent approach to unconventional
computing. We describe its computational mechanisms and different generic
application domains, together with concrete example ap- plications of material
computation. We examine the potential exploitation of the approach for
computational geometry, path planning, combinatorial optimisation, data
smoothing and statistical applications.

570,"Towards Lateral Inhibition and Collective Perception in Unorganised
  Non-Neural Systems","  Could simple organisms such as slime mould approximate LI without recourse to
neural tissue? We describe a model whereby LI can emerge without explicit
inhibitory wiring, using only bulk transport effects. We use a multi-agent
model of slime mould to reproduce the char- acteristic edge contrast
amplification effects of LI using excitation via attractant based stimuli. We
also explore a counterpart behaviour, Lateral Activation (where stimulated
regions are inhibited and lateral regions are excited), using simulated
exposure to light irradiation. In both cases restoration of baseline activity
occurs when the stimuli are removed. In addition to the enhancement of local
edge contrast the long-term change in population density distribution
corresponds to a collective response to the global brightness of 2D image
stimuli, including the scalloped inten- sity profile of the Chevreul staircase
and the perceived difference of two identically bright patches in the
Simultaneous Brightness Contrast (SBC) effect. This simple
modelapproximatesLIcontrastenhancementphenomenaandglobalbrightnessper- ception
in collective unorganised systems without fixed neural architectures. This may
encourage further research into unorganised analogues of neural processes in
simple organisms and suggests novel mechanisms to generate collective
perception of contrast and brightness in distributed computing and robotic
devices.
"
571,"Representation of Shape Mediated by Environmental Stimuli in Physarum
  polycephalum and a Multi-agent Model","  The slime mould Physarum polycephalum is known to construct proto- plasmic
transport networks which approximate proximity graphs by forag- ing for
nutrients during its plasmodial life cycle stage. In these networks, nodes are
represented by nutrients and edges are represented by proto- plasmic tubes.
These networks have been shown to be efficient in terms of length and
resilience of the overall network to random damage. However relatively little
research has been performed in the potential for Physarum transport networks to
approximate the overall shape of a dataset. In this paper we distinguish
between connectivity and shape of a planar point dataset and demonstrate, using
scoping experiments with plasmodia of P. polycephalum and a multi-agent model
of the organism, how we can gen- erate representations of the external and
internal shapes of a set of points. As with proximity graphs formed by P.
polycephalum, the behaviour of the plasmodium (real and model) is mediated by
environmental stimuli. We further explore potential morphological computation
approaches with the multi-agent model, presenting methods which approximate the
Convex Hull and the Concave Hull. We demonstrate how a growth parameter in the
model can be used to transition between Convex and Concave Hulls. These results
suggest novel mechanisms of morphological computation mediated by environmental
stimuli.
"
572,"Quantitative Transformation for Implementation of Adder Circuits in
  Physical Systems","  Computing devices are composed of spatial arrangements of simple funda-
mental logic gates. These gates may be combined to form more complex adding
circuits and, ultimately, complete computer systems. Implementing classical
adding circuits using unconventional, or even living substrates such as slime
mould Physarum polycephalum, is made difficult and often impracti- cal by the
challenges of branching fan-out of inputs and regions where circuit lines must
cross without interference. In this report we explore whether it is possible to
avoid spatial propagation, branching and crossing completely in the design of
adding circuits. We analyse the input and output patterns of a single-bit full
adder circuit. A simple quantitative transformation of the input patterns which
considers the total number of bits in the input string allows us to map the
respective input combinations to the correct outputs patterns of the full adder
circuit, reducing the circuit combinations from a 2:1 mapping to a 1:1 mapping.
The mapping of inputs to outputs also shows an incremental linear progression,
suggesting its implementation in a range of physical systems. We demonstrate an
example implementation, first in simulation, inspired by self-oscillatory
dynamics of the acellular slime mould Physarum polycephalum. We then assess the
potential implementation using plasmodium of slime mould itself. This simple
transformation may enrich the potential for using unconventional computing
substrates to implement digital circuits.
"
573,"Mechanisms Inducing Parallel Computation in a Model of Physarum
  polycephalum Transport Networks","  P. polycephalum may be considered as a spatially represented parallel
unconventional computing substrate, but how can this `computer' be programmed?
In this paper we examine and catalogue individual low-level mechanisms which
may be used to induce network formation and adaptation in a multi-agent model
of P. polycephalum. These mechanisms include those intrinsic to the model
(particle sensor angle, rotation angle, and scaling parameters) and those
mediated by the environment (stimulus loca- tion, distance, angle,
concentration, engulfment and consumption of nutrients, and the presence of
simulated light irradiation, repellents and obstacles). The mechanisms in- duce
a concurrent integration of chemoattractant and chemorepellent gradients
diffusing within the 2D lattice upon which the agent population resides,
stimulating growth, move- ment, morphological adaptation and network
minimisation. Chemoattractant gradients, and their modulation by the engulfment
and consumption of nutrients by the model population, represent an efficient
outsourcing of spatial computation. The mechanisms may prove useful in
understanding the search strategies and adaptation of distributed organisms
within their environment, in understanding the minimal requirements for com-
plex adaptive behaviours, and in developing methods of spatially programming
parallel unconventional computers and robotic devices.
"
574,Synchronization of two memristive coupled van der Pol oscillators,"  The objective of this paper is to explore the possibility to couple two van
der Pol (vdP) oscillators via a resistance-capacitance (RC) network comprising
a Ag-TiOx-Al memristive device. The coupling was mediated by connecting the
gate terminals of two programmable unijunction transistors (PUTs) through the
network. In the high resistance state (HRS) the memresistance was in the order
of MOhm leading to two independent selfsustained oscillators characterized by
the different frequencies f1 and f2 and no phase relation between the
oscillations. After a few cycles and in dependency of the mediated pulse
amplitude the memristive device switched to the low resistance state (LRS) and
a frequency adaptation and phase locking was observed. The experimental results
are underlined by theoretically considering a system of two coupled vdP
equations. The presented neuromorphic circuitry conveys two essentials
principle of interacting neuronal ensembles: synchronization and memory. The
experiment may path the way to larger neuromorphic networks in which the
coupling parameters can vary in time and strength and are realized by
memristive devices.
"
575,Through-Wall Person Localization Using Transceivers in Motion,"  We develop novel methods for device-free localization (DFL) using
transceivers in motion. Such localization technologies are useful in various
cross-layer applications/protocols including those that are related to security
situations where it is important to know the presence and position of an
unauthorized person; in monitoring the daily activities of elderly or special
needs individuals; or in emergency situations when police or firefighters can
use the locations of people inside of a building in order to save lives. We
propose that transceivers mounted on autonomous vehicles could be both quickly
deployed and kept moving to ``sweep'' an area for changes in the channel that
would indicate the location of moving people and objects. The challenge is that
changes to channel measurements are introduced both by changes in the
environment and from motion of the transceivers. In this paper, we demonstrate
a method to detect human movement despite transceiver motion using
ultra-wideband impulse radar (UWB-IR) transceivers. The measurements reliably
detect a person's presence on a link line despite small-scale fading. We
explore via multiple experiments the ability of mobile UWB-IR transceivers,
moving outside of the walls of a room, to measure many lines crossing through
the room and accurately locate a person inside within 0.25 m average error.
"
576,"An Approximate Backpropagation Learning Rule for Memristor Based Neural
  Networks Using Synaptic Plasticity","  We describe an approximation to backpropagation algorithm for training deep
neural networks, which is designed to work with synapses implemented with
memristors. The key idea is to represent the values of both the input signal
and the backpropagated delta value with a series of pulses that trigger
multiple positive or negative updates of the synaptic weight, and to use the
min operation instead of the product of the two signals. In computational
simulations, we show that the proposed approximation to backpropagation is well
converged and may be suitable for memristor implementations of multilayer
neural networks.
"
577,"Exploiting Environmental Computation in a Multi-Agent Model of Slime
  Mould","  Very simple organisms, such as the single-celled amoeboid slime mould
Physarum polycephalum possess no neural tissue yet, despite this, are known to
exhibit complex biological and computational behaviour. Given such limited
resources, can environmental stimuli play a role in generating the complexity
of slime mould behaviour? We use a multi-agent collective model of slime mould
to explore a two-way mechanism where the collective behaviour is influenced by
simulated chemical concentration gradient fields and, in turn, this behaviour
alters the spatial pattern of the concentration gradients. This simple
mechanism yields complex behaviour amid the dynamically changing gradient
profiles and suggests how the apparently intelligent response of the slime
mould could possibly be due to outsourcing of computation to the environment.
"
578,"Material-based Non-neural Analogues of Lateral Inhibition: A Multi-agent
  Approach","  Lateral Inhibition (LI) phenomena occur in a wide range of sensory modalities
and are most famously described in the human visual system. In LI the activity
of a stimulated neuron is itself excited and suppresses the activity of its
local neighbours via inhibitory connections, increasing the contrast between
spatial environmental stimuli. Simple or- ganisms, such as the single-celled
slime mould Physarum polycephalum possess no neural tissue yet, despite this,
are known to exhibit complex computational behaviour. Could simple organisms
such as slime mould approximate LI without recourse to neural tissue? We
describe a model whereby LI can emerge without explicit inhibitory wiring,
using only bulk transport effects. We use a multi-agent virtual material model
of slime mould to reproduce the characteristic contrast amplification response
of LI using excitation via attractant stimuli. Restoration of baseline activ-
ity occurs when the stimuli are removed. We also explore an opposite
counterpart behaviour, Lateral Activation (LA), using repellent stimuli. These
preliminary results suggest that simple organisms without neural tissue may
approximate sensory contrast enhancement using alternative analogues of LI and
suggests novel approaches towards generating collec- tive contrast enhancement
in distributed computing and robotic devices.
"
579,"Automated Guidance of Collective Movement in a Multi-Agent Model of
  Physarum polycephalum","  Collective movement occurs in living systems where the simple movements of
individual members of a pop- ulation are combined to generate movement of the
collective as a whole, displaying complex dynamics which cannot be found in the
component parts themselves. The plasmodium stage of slime mould Physarum
polycephalum displays complex amoeboid movement during its foraging and hazard
avoidance and its movement can be influenced by the spatial placement of
attractant and repellent stimuli. Slime mould is attractive to robotics due to
its simple component parts and the distributed nature of its control and
locomotion mechanisms. We investigate methods of automated guidance of a
multi-agent swarm collective along a pre-defined path to a goal location. We
demonstrate a closed-loop feedback mechanism using attractant and repellent
stimuli. We find that guidance by repellent stimuli (a light illumination mask)
provides faster and more accurate guidance than attractant sources, which
exhibit overshooting phenomena at path turns. The method allows traversal of
convoluted arenas with challenging obstacles and provides an insight into how
unconven- tional computing substrates may be hybridised with classical
computing methods to take advantage of the benefits of both approaches.
"
580,Practical circuits with Physarum Wires,"  Purpose: Protoplasmic tubes of Physarum polycephalum, also know as Physarum
Wires (PW), have been previously suggested as novel bio- electronic components.
Until recently, practical examples of electronic circuits using PWs have been
limited. These PWs have been shown to be self repairing, offering significant
advantage over traditional electronic components. This article documents work
performed to produce practical circuits using PWs. Method: We have demonstrated
through manufacture and testing of hybrid circuits that PWs can be used to
produce a variety of practical electronic circuits. A purality of different
applications of PWs have been tested to show the universality of PWs in
analogue and digital electronics. Results: Voltage dividers can be produced
using a pair of PWs in series with an output voltage accurate to within 12%.
PWs can also transmit analogue and digital data with a frequency of up to 19
kHz, which with the addition of a buffer, can drive high current circuits. We
have demonstrated that PWs can last approximately two months, a 4 fold increase
on previous literature. Protoplasmic tubes can be modified with the addition of
conductive or magnetic nano-particles to provide changes in functionality.
Conclusion This work has documented novel macro-scale data transmission through
biological material; it has advanced the field of bio-electronics by providing
a cheap and easy to grow conducting bio-material which may be used in future
hybrid electronic technology.
"
581,Study of Memristor-based Oscillatory Neural Networks using PPV modeling,"  Memristor-based oscillator is becoming promising thanks to its inherent NDR
(Negative Differential Region) property and compact circuit structure. This
paves the way to the large scale oscillatory neural network (ONN) and the
realization of pattern recognition based on its global synchronization.
However, the simulation of large scale ONN encounters the problem of long
simulation time because of the large number of oscillators. Here we propose a
highly efficient method to abstract the phase sensitivity characteristic of the
memristor-based oscillator, i.e., its PPV (Perturbation Projection Vector),
which allows reducing considerably the complexity of ONN simulation, and
speeding up the simulation more than 2000 times. Our study also reveals the
impact of the circuit parameters on the pattern recognition accuracy and the
robustness against the frequency mismatch.
"
582,"A Novel Molecular Communication System Using Acids, Bases and Hydrogen
  Ions","  Concentration modulation, whereby information is encoded in the concentration
level of chemicals, is considered. One of the main challenges with such systems
is the limited control the transmitter has on the concentration level at the
receiver. For example, concentration cannot be directly decreased by the
transmitter, and the decrease in concentration over time occurs solely due to
transport mechanisms such as diffusion. This can result in inter-symbol
interference (ISI), which can have degrading effects on performance. In this
work, a new and novel scheme is proposed that uses the transmission of acids,
bases, and the concentration of hydrogen ions for carrying information. By
employing this technique, the concentration of hydrogen ions at the receiver
can be both increased and decreased through the sender's transmissions. This
enables novel ISI mitigation schemes as well as the possibility to form a wider
array of signal patterns at the receiver.
"
583,"High Sensitivity Biosensor using Injection Locked Spin Torque
  Nano-Oscillators","  With ever increasing research on magnetic nano systems it is shown to have
great potential in the areas of magnetic storage, biosensing, magnetoresistive
insulation etc. In the field of biosensing specifically Spin Valve sensors
coupled with Magnetic Nanolabels is showing great promise due to noise immunity
and energy efficiency [1]. In this paper we present the application of
injection locked based Spin Torque Nano Oscillator (STNO) suitable for high
resolution energy efficient labeled DNA Detection. The proposed STNO microarray
consists of 20 such devices oscillating at different frequencies making it
possible to multiplex all the signals using capacitive coupling. Frequency
Division Multiplexing can be aided with Time division multiplexing to increase
the device integration and decrease the readout time while maintaining the same
efficiency in presence of constant input referred noise.
"
584,"Energy Efficient and High Performance Current-Mode Neural Network
  Circuit using Memristors and Digitally Assisted Analog CMOS Neurons","  Emerging nano-scale programmable Resistive-RAM (RRAM) has been identified as
a promising technology for implementing brain-inspired computing hardware.
Several neural network architectures, that essentially involve computation of
scalar products between input data vectors and stored network weights can be
efficiently implemented using high density cross-bar arrays of RRAM integrated
with CMOS. In such a design, the CMOS interface may be responsible for
providing input excitations and for processing the RRAM output. In order to
achieve high energy efficiency along with high integration density in RRAM
based neuromorphic hardware, the design of RRAM-CMOS interface can therefore
play a major role. In this work we propose design of high performance, current
mode CMOS interface for RRAM based neural network design. The use of current
mode excitation for input interface and design of digitally assisted
current-mode CMOS neuron circuit for the output interface is presented. The
proposed technique achieve 10x energy as well as performance improvement over
conventional approaches employed in literature. Network level simulations show
that the proposed scheme can achieve 2 orders of magnitude lower energy
dissipation as compared to a digital ASIC implementation of a feed-forward
neural network.
"
585,Discrete and Continuous Systems of Logic in Nuclear Magnetic Resonance,"  We implement several non-binary logic systems using the spin dynamics of
nuclear spins in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The NMR system is a suitable
test system because of its high degree of experimental control; findings from
NMR implementations are relevant for other computational platforms exploiting
particles with spin, such as electrons or photons. While we do not expect the
NMR system to become a practical computational device, it is uniquely useful to
explore strengths and weaknesses of unconventional computational approaches,
such as non-binary logic.
"
586,Spin-Torque Sensors for Energy Efficient High Speed Long Interconnects,"  In this paper, we propose a Spin-Torque (ST) based sensing scheme that can
enable energy efficient multi-bit long distance interconnect architectures.
Current-mode interconnects have recently been proposed to overcome the
performance degradations associated with conventional voltage mode Copper (Cu)
interconnects. However, the performance of current mode interconnects are
limited by analog current sensing transceivers and equalization circuits. As a
solution, we propose the use of ST based receivers that use Magnetic Tunnel
Junctions (MTJ) and simple digital components for current-to-voltage conversion
and do not require analog transceivers. We incorporate Spin-Hall Metal (SHM) in
our design to achieve high speed sensing. We show both single and multi-bit
operations that reveal major benefits at higher speeds. Our simulation results
show that the proposed technique consumes only 3.93-4.72 fJ/bit/mm energy while
operating at 1-2 Gbits/sec; which is considerably better than existing charge
based interconnects. In addition, Voltage Controlled Magnetic Anisotropy (VCMA)
can reduce the required current at the sensor. With the inclusion of VCMA, the
energy consumption can be further reduced to 2.02-4.02 fJ/bit/mm

587,Building exploration with leeches Hirudo verbana,"  Safe evacuation of people from building and outdoor environments, and search
and rescue operations, always will remain actual in course of all
socio-technological developments. Modern facilities offer a range of automated
systems to guide residents towards emergency exists. The systems are assumed to
be infallible. But what if they fail? How occupants not familiar with a
building layout will be looking for exits in case of very limited visibility
where tactile sensing is the only way to assess the environment? Analogous
models of human behaviour, and socio-dynamics in general, are provided to be
fruitful ways to explore alternative, or would-be scenarios. Crowd, or a single
person, dynamics could be imitated using particle systems, reaction-diffusion
chemical medium, electro-magnetic fields, or social insects. Each type of
analogous model offer unique insights on behavioural patterns of natural
systems in constrained geometries. In this particular paper we have chosen
leeches to analyse patterns of exploration. Reasons are two-fold. First, when
deprived from other stimuli leeches change their behavioural modes in an
automated regime in response to mechanical stimulation. Therefore leeches can
give us invaluable information on how human beings might behave under stress
and limited visibility. Second, leeches are ideal blueprints of future
soft-bodied rescue robots. Leeches have modular nervous circuitry with a rich
behavioral spectrum. Leeches are multi-functional, fault-tolerant with
autonomous inter-segment coordination and adaptive decision-making. We aim to
answer the question: how efficiently a real building can be explored and
whether there any dependencies on the pathways of exploration and geometrical
complexity of the building. In our case studies we use templates made on the
floor plan of real building.
"
588,"On exploration of geometrically constrained space by medicinal leeches
  Hirudo verbana","  Leeches are fascinating creatures: they have simple modular nervous circuitry
m yet exhibit a rich spectrum of behavioural modes. Leeches could be ideal
blue-prints for designing flexible soft robots which are modular,
multi-functional, fault-tolerant, easy to control, capable for navigating using
optical, mechanical and chemical sensorial inputs, have autonomous
inter-segmental coordination and adaptive decision-making. With future designs
of leech-robots in mind we study how leeches behave in geometrically
constrained spaces. Core results of the paper deal with leeches exploring a row
of rooms arranged along a narrow corridor. In laboratory experiments we find
that rooms closer to ends of the corridor are explored by leeches more often
than rooms in the middle of the corridor. Also, in series of scoping
experiments, we evaluate leeches capabilities to navigating in mazes towards
sources of vibration and chemo-attraction. We believe our results lay
foundation for future developments of robots mimicking behaviour of leeches.

589,"Living Wires - Effects of Size and Coating of Gold Nanoparticles in
  Altering the Electrical Properties of Physarum polycephalum and Lettuce
  Seedlings","  The manipulation of biological substrates is becoming more popular route
towards generating novel computing devices. Physarum polycephalum is used as a
model organism in biocomputing because it can create `wires' for use in hybrid
circuits; programmable growth by manipulation through external stimuli and the
ability withstanding a current and its tolerance to hybridisation with a
variety of nano/microparticles. Lettuce seedlings have also had previous
interest invested in them for generating plant wires, although currently there
is little information as to their suitability for such applications. In this
study both P. polycephalum and Lettuce seedlings were hybridised with gold
nanoparticles - functionalised and unfunctionalised - to explore their uptake,
toxicological effects and, crucially, any alterations in electrical properties
they bestow upon the organisms. Using various microscopy techniques it was
shown that P. polycephalum and lettuce seedlings are able to internalize
nanoparticles and assemble them in vivo, however some toxicological effects
were observed. The electrical resistance of both lettuce seedlings and P.
polycephalum was found to decrease, the most significant reduction being with
lettuce seedlings whose resistance reduced from 3MOhms to 0.5MOhms. We conclude
that gold is a suitable nanomaterial for biohybridisation specifically in
creating conductive pathways for more efficient biological wires in
self-growing hybrid circuitry.
"
590,On hybrid circuits exploiting thermistive properties of slime mould,"  Slime mould Physarum polycephalum is a single cell visible by unaided eye.
Let the slime mould span two electrodes with a single protoplasmic tube: if the
tube is heated to approximately 40{\deg}C, the electrical resistance of the
protoplasmic tube increases from 3 M{\Omega} to approximatively 10'000
M{\Omega}. The organism's resistance is not proportional nor correlated to the
temperature of its environment. Slime mould can therefore not be considered as
a thermistor but rather as a thermic switch. We employ the P. polycephalum
thermic switch to prototype hybrid electrical analog summator, NAND gates, and
cascade the gates into Flip-Flop latch. Computing operations performed on this
bio-hybrid computing circuitry feature high repeatability, reproducibility and
comparably low propagation delays
"
591,"Multi-path Model and Sensitivity Analysis for Galvanic Coupled
  Intra-body Communication through Layered Tissue","  New medical procedures promise continuous patient monitoring and drug
delivery through implanted sensors and actuators. When over the air wireless
radio frequency (OTA-RF) links are used for intra-body implant communication,
the network incurs heavy energy costs owing to absorption within the human
tissue. With this motivation, we explore an alternate form of intra-body
communication that relies on weak electrical signals, instead of OTA-RF. To
demonstrate the feasibility of this new paradigm for enabling communication
between sensors and actuators embedded within the tissue, or placed on the
surface of the skin, we develop a rigorous analytical model based on galvanic
coupling of low energy signals. The main contributions in this paper are: (i)
developing a suite of analytical expressions for modeling the resulting
communication channel for weak electrical signals in a three dimensional
multi-layered tissue structure, (ii) validating and verifying the model through
extensive finite element simulations, published measurements in existing
literature, and experiments conducted with porcine tissue, (iii) designing the
communication framework with safety considerations, and analyzing the influence
of different network and hardware parameters such as transmission frequency and
electrode placements. Our results reveal a close agreement between theory,
simulation, literature and experimental findings, pointing to the suitability
of the model for quick and accurate channel characterization and parameter
estimation for networked and implanted sensors.
"
592,Lively quantum walks on cycles,"  We introduce a family of quantum walks on cycles parametrized by their
liveliness, defined by the ability to execute a long-range move. We investigate
the behaviour of the probability distribution and time-averaged probability
distribution. We show that the liveliness parameter, controlling the magnitude
of the additional long-range move, has a direct impact on the periodicity of
the limiting distribution. We also show that the introduced model provides a
method for network exploration which is robust against trapping.
"
593,Stochastic Interpretation of Quasi-periodic Event-based Systems,"  Many networks used in machine learning and as models of biological neural
networks make use of stochastic neurons or neuron-like units. We show that
stochastic artificial neurons can be realized on silicon chips by exploiting
the quasi-periodic behavior of mismatched analog oscillators to approximate the
neuron's stochastic activation function. We represent neurons by finite state
machines (FSMs) that communicate using digital events and whose transitions are
event-triggered. The event generation times of each neuron are controlled by an
analog oscillator internal to that neuron/FSM and the frequencies of the
oscillators in different FSMs are incommensurable. We show that within this
quasi-periodic system, the transition graph of a FSM can be interpreted as the
transition graph of a Markov chain and we show that by using different FSMs, we
can obtain approximations of different stochastic activation functions. We
investigate the quality of the stochastic interpretation of such a
deterministic system and we use the system to realize and sample from a
restricted Boltzmann machine. We implemented the quasi-periodic event-based
system on a custom silicon chip and we show that the chip behavior can be used
to closely approximate a stochastic sampling task.
"
594,Current Injection Attack against the KLJN Secure Key Exchange,"  The Kirchhoff-law-Johnson-noise (KLJN) scheme is a statistical/physical
secure key exchange system based on the laws of classical statistical physics
to provide unconditional security. We used the LTSPICE industrial cable and
circuit simulator to emulate one of the major active (invasive) attacks, the
current injection attack, against the ideal and a practical KLJN system,
respectively. We show that two security enhancement techniques, namely, the
instantaneous voltage/current comparison method, and a simple privacy
amplification scheme, independently and effectively eliminate the information
leak and successfully preserve the system's unconditional security.
"
595,Improved Quantum Ternary Arithmetics,"  Qutrit (or ternary) structures arise naturally in many quantum systems,
particularly in certain non-abelian anyon systems. We present efficient
circuits for ternary reversible and quantum arithmetics. Our main result is the
derivation of circuits for two families of ternary quantum adders, namely
ripple carry adders and carry look-ahead adders. The main difference to the
binary case is the more complicated form of the ternary carry, which leads to
higher resource counts for implementations over a universal ternary gate set.
Our ternary ripple adder circuit has a circuit depth of $O(n)$ and uses only
$1$ ancilla, making it more efficient in both, circuit depth and width than
previous constructions. Our ternary carry lookahead circuit has a circuit depth
of only $O(\log\,n)$, while using with $O(n)$ ancillas. Our approach works on
two levels of abstraction: at the first level, descriptions of arithmetic
circuits are given in terms of gates sequences that use various types of
non-Clifford reflections. At the second level, we break down these reflections
further by deriving them either from the two-qutrit Clifford gates and the
non-Clifford gate $C(X): |i,j\rangle \mapsto |i, j + \delta_{i,2} \mod
3\rangle$ or from the two-qutrit Clifford gates and the non-Clifford gate
$P_9=\mbox{diag}(e^{-2 \pi \, i/9},1,e^{2 \pi \, i/9})$. The two choices of
elementary gate sets correspond to two possible mappings onto two different
prospective quantum computing architectures which we call the metaplectic and
the supermetaplectic basis, respectively. Finally, we develop a method to
factor diagonal unitaries using multi-variate polynomial over the ternary
finite field which allows to characterize classes of gates that can be
implemented exactly over the supermetaplectic basis.
"
596,"A Fair Admission Control Mechanism for Efficient Utilization of
  Resources in On-chip Nanophotonic Crossbars","  Advances in CMOS-compatible photonic elements have made it plausible to
exploit nanophotonic communications to overcome the limitations of traditional
NoCs. Amongst various proposed nanophotonic architectures, optical crossbars
have been shown to provide high performance in terms of bandwidth and latency.
In general, optical crossbars provide a vast volume of network resources that
are shared among all the cores within the chip. In this paper, we present a
fair and efficient admission control mechanism for shared wavelengths and
buffer space in optical crossbars. We model buffer management and wavelength
assignment as a utility-based convex optimization problem, whose solution
determines the admission control policy. Thanks to efficient convex
optimization techniques, we obtain the globally optimal solution of the
admission control optimization problem by using simple and yet efficient
iterative algorithms. We cast our solution procedure as an iterative algorithm
to be implemented a central admission controller. Our experimental results
corroborate the gain that can be obtained by using such an admission controller
to manage the shared resources of the system. Furthermore, they confirm that
the proposed admission control algorithm works well for various traffic
patterns and parameters, and evinces a tractable scalability with increase in
the number of cores of the crossbar.
"
597,Applying Grover's algorithm to AES: quantum resource estimates,"  We present quantum circuits to implement an exhaustive key search for the
Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and analyze the quantum resources required
to carry out such an attack. We consider the overall circuit size, the number
of qubits, and the circuit depth as measures for the cost of the presented
quantum algorithms. Throughout, we focus on Clifford$+T$ gates as the
underlying fault-tolerant logical quantum gate set. In particular, for all
three variants of AES (key size 128, 192, and 256 bit) that are standardized in
FIPS-PUB 197, we establish precise bounds for the number of qubits and the
number of elementary logical quantum gates that are needed to implement
Grover's quantum algorithm to extract the key from a small number of AES
plaintext-ciphertext pairs.
"
598,"Polynomial-time solution of prime factorization and NP-hard problems
  with digital memcomputing machines","  We introduce a class of digital machines we name Digital Memcomputing
Machines (DMMs) able to solve a wide range of problems including
Non-deterministic Polynomial (NP) ones with polynomial resources (in time,
space and energy). An abstract DMM with this power must satisfy a set of
compatible mathematical constraints underlying its practical realization. We
initially prove this by introducing the complexity classes for these machines.
We then make a connection with dynamical systems theory. This leads to the set
of physical constraints for poly-resource resolvability. Once the mathematical
requirements have been assessed, we propose a practical scheme to solve the
above class of problems based on the novel concept of self-organizing logic
gates and circuits (SOLCs). These are logic gates and circuits able to accept
input signals from any terminal, without distinction between conventional input
and output terminals. They can solve boolean problems by self-organizing into
their solution. They can be fabricated either with circuit elements with memory
(such as memristors) and/or standard MOS technology. Using tools of functional
analysis, we prove mathematically the following constraints for the
poly-resource resolvability: i) SOLCs possess a global attractor; ii) their
only equilibrium points are the solutions of the problems to solve; iii) the
system converges exponentially fast to the solutions; iv) the equilibrium
convergence rate scales at most polynomially with input size. We finally
provide arguments that periodic orbits and strange attractors cannot coexist
with equilibria. As examples we show how to solve the prime factorization and
the NP-hard version of the subset-sum problem. Since DMMs map integers into
integers they are robust against noise, and hence scalable. We finally discuss
the implications of the DMM realization through SOLCs to the NP=P question
related to...

599,"Reactive Receiver Modeling for Diffusive Molecular Communication Systems
  with Molecule Degradation","  In this paper, we consider the diffusive molecular communication channel
between a transmitter nano-machine and a receiver nano-machine in a fluid
environment. The information molecules released by the transmitter nano-machine
into the environment can degrade in the channel via a first-order degradation
reaction and those that reach the receiver nano-machine can participate in a
reversible bimolecular-reaction with receiver receptor proteins. We derive a
closed-form analytical expression for the expected received signal at the
receiver, i.e., the expected number of activated receptors on the surface of
the receiver. The accuracy of the derived analytical result is verified with a
Brownian motion particle-based simulation of the environment.

600,"Squash 2: A Hierarchical Scalable Quantum Mapper Considering Ancilla
  Sharing","  We present a multi-core reconfigurable quantum processor architecture, called
Requp, which supports a hierarchical approach to mapping a quantum algorithm
while sharing physical and logical ancilla qubits. Each core is capable of
performing any quantum instruction. Moreover, we introduce a scalable quantum
mapper, called Squash 2, which divides a given quantum circuit into a number of
quantum modules---each module is divided into k parts such that each part will
run on one of k available cores. Experimental results demonstrate that Squash~2
can handle large-scale quantum algorithms while providing an effective
mechanism for sharing ancilla qubits.

601,Thermal Aware Design Method for VCSEL-Based On-Chip Optical Interconnect,"  Optical Network-on-Chip (ONoC) is an emerging technology considered as one of
the key solutions for future generation on-chip interconnects. However, silicon
photonic devices in ONoC are highly sensitive to temperature variation, which
leads to a lower efficiency of Vertical-Cavity Surface-Emitting Lasers
(VCSELs), a resonant wavelength shift of Microring Resonators (MR), and results
in a lower Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR). In this paper, we propose a methodology
enabling thermal-aware design for optical interconnects relying on
CMOS-compatible VCSEL. Thermal simulations allow designing ONoC interfaces with
low gradient temperature and analytical models allow evaluating the SNR.

602,"Optical Crossbars on Chip: a comparative study based on worst-case
  losses","  The many cores design research community have shown high interest in optical
crossbars on chip for more than a decade. Key properties of optical crossbars,
namely a) contention free data routing b) low latency communication and c)
potential for high bandwidth through the use of WDM, motivate several
implementations of this type of interconnect. These implementations demonstrate
very different scalability and power efficiency ability depending on three key
design factors: a) the network topology, b) the considered layout and the c)
the injection losses induced by the fabrication process. In this paper, the
worst-case optical losses of crossbar implementations are compared according to
the factors mentioned above. The comparison results has the potential to help
many cores system designer to select the most appropriate crossbar
implementation according, for instance, to the number of IP cores and the chip
die size.
"
603,"Energy-efficient optical crossbars on chip with multi-layer deposited
  silicon","  The many cores design research community have shown high interest in optical
crossbars on chip for more than a decade. Key properties of optical crossbars,
namely a) contention-free data routing b) low-latency communication and c)
potential for high bandwidth through the use of WDM, motivate several
implementations. These implementations demonstrate very different scalability
and power efficiency ability depending on three key design factors: a) the
network topology, b) the considered layout and c) the insertion losses induced
by the fabrication process. The emerging design technique relying on
multi-layer deposited silicon allows reducing optical losses, which may lead to
significant reduction of the power consumption. In this paper, multi-layer
deposited silicon based crossbars are proposed and compared. The results
indicate that the proposed ring-based network exhibits, on average, 22% and
51.4% improvement for worst-case and average losses respectively compared to
the most power-efficient related crossbars.
"
604,"Hardware Architecture for Large Parallel Array of Random Feature
  Extractors applied to Image Recognition","  We demonstrate a low-power and compact hardware implementation of Random
Feature Extractor (RFE) core. With complex tasks like Image Recognition
requiring a large set of features, we show how weight reuse technique can allow
to virtually expand the random features available from RFE core. Further, we
show how to avoid computation cost wasted for propagating ""incognizant"" or
redundant random features. For proof of concept, we validated our approach by
using our RFE core as the first stage of Extreme Learning Machine (ELM)--a two
layer neural network--and were able to achieve $>97\%$ accuracy on MNIST
database of handwritten digits. ELM's first stage of RFE is done on an analog
ASIC occupying $5$mm$\times5$mm area in $0.35\mu$m CMOS and consuming $5.95$
$\mu$J/classify while using $\approx 5000$ effective hidden neurons. The ELM
second stage consisting of just adders can be implemented as digital circuit
with estimated power consumption of $20.9$ nJ/classify. With a total energy
consumption of only $5.97$ $\mu$J/classify, this low-power mixed signal ASIC
can act as a co-processor in portable electronic gadgets with cameras.
"
605,Thirty eight things to do with live slime mould,"  Slime mould \emph{Physarum polycephalum} is a large single cell capable for
distributed sensing, concurrent information processing, parallel computation
and decentralised actuation. The ease of culturing and experimenting with
Physarum makes this slime mould an ideal substrate for real-world
implementations of unconventional sensing and computing devices. In the last
decade the Physarum became a swiss knife of the unconventional computing: give
the slime mould a problem it will solve it. We provide a concise summary of
what exact computing and sensing operations are implemented with live slime
mould. The Physarum devices range from morphological processors for
computational geometry to experimental archeology tools, from self-routing
wires to memristors, from devices approximating a shortest path to analog
physical models of space exploration.
"
606,"OpenFlow Arbitrated Programmable Network Channels for Managing Quantum
  Metadata","  Quantum networks must classically exchange complex metadata between devices
in order to carry out information for protocols such as teleportation,
super-dense coding, and quantum key distribution. Demonstrating the integration
of these new communication methods with existing network protocols, channels,
and data forwarding mechanisms remains an open challenge. Software-defined
networking (SDN) offers robust and flexible strategies for managing diverse
network devices and uses. We adapt the principles of SDN to the deployment of
quantum networks, which are composed from unique devices that operate according
to the laws of quantum mechanics. We show how quantum metadata can be managed
within a software-defined network using the OpenFlow protocol, and we describe
how OpenFlow management of classical optical channels is compatible with
emerging quantum communication protocols. We next give an example specification
of the metadata needed to manage and control QPHY behavior and we extend the
OpenFlow interface to accommodate this quantum metadata. We conclude by
discussing near-term experimental efforts that can realize SDN's principles for
quantum communication.
"
607,New Designs of Universal Reversible Gate Library,"  We present new algorithms to synthesize exact universal reversible gate
library for various types of gates and costs. We use the powerful algebraic
software GAP for implementation and examination of our algorithms and the
reversible logic synthesis problems have been reduced to group theory problems.
It is shown that minimization of arbitrary cost functions of gates and orders
of magnitude are faster than its previously counterparts for reversible logic
synthesis. Experimental results show that a significant improvement over the
previously proposed synthesis algorithm is obtained compared with the existing
approaches to reversible logic synthesis.
"
608,Actin automata with memory,"  Actin is a globular protein which forms long polar filaments in eukaryotic.
The actin filaments play roles of cytoskeleton, motility units , information
processing and learning. We model actin filament as a double chain of finite
state machines, nodes, which take states `0' and `1'. The states are
abstractions of absence and presence of a sub-threshold charge on an actin
units corresponding to the nodes. All nodes update their state in parallel in
discrete time. A node updates its current state depending on states of two
closest neighbours in the node chain and two closest neighbours in the
complementary chain. Previous models of actin automata considered momentary
state transitions of nodes. We enrich the actin automata model by assuming that
states of nodes depends not only on the current states of neighbouring node but
also on their past states. Thus, we assess the effect of memory of past states
on the dynamics of acting automata. We demonstrate in computational experiments
that memory slows down propagation of perturbations, decrease entropy of
space-time patterns generated, transforms travelling localisations to
stationary oscillators, and stationary oscillations to still patterns.
"
609,"Modeling and Simulation of Molecular Communication Systems with a
  Reversible Adsorption Receiver","  In this paper, we present an analytical model for the diffusive molecular
communication (MC) system with a reversible adsorption receiver in a fluid
environment. The widely used concentration shift keying (CSK) is considered for
modulation. The time-varying spatial distribution of the information molecules
under the reversible adsorption and desorption reaction at the surface of a
receiver is analytically characterized. Based on the spatial distribution, we
derive the net number of newly-adsorbed information molecules expected in any
time duration. We further derive the number of newly-adsorbed molecules
expected at the steady state to demonstrate the equilibrium concentration.
Given the number of newly-adsorbed information molecules, the bit error
probability of the proposed MC system is analytically approximated.
Importantly, we present a simulation framework for the proposed model that
accounts for the diffusion and reversible reaction. Simulation results show the
accuracy of our derived expressions, and demonstrate the positive effect of the
adsorption rate and the negative effect of the desorption rate on the error
probability of reversible adsorption receiver with last transmit bit-1.
Moreover, our analytical results simplify to the special cases of a full
adsorption receiver and a partial adsorption receiver, both of which do not
include desorption.
"
610,Universal Coating for Programmable Matter,"  The idea behind universal coating is to have a thin layer of a specific
substance covering an object of any shape so that one can measure a certain
condition (like temperature or cracks) at any spot on the surface of the object
without requiring direct access to that spot. We study the universal coating
problem in the context of self-organizing programmable matter consisting of
simple computational elements, called particles, that can establish and release
bonds and can actively move in a self-organized way. Based on that matter, we
present a worst-case work-optimal universal coating algorithm that uniformly
coats any object of arbitrary shape and size that allows a uniform coating. Our
particles are anonymous, do not have any global information, have constant-size
memory, and utilize only local interactions.
"
611,Memristive fingerprints of electric arcs,"  We discuss the memristive fingerprints of the hybrid Cassie-Mayr model of
electric arcs. In particular, it is shown that (i) the voltage-current
characteristic of the model has the pinched hysteresis nature, (ii) the voltage
and current zero crossings occur at the same instants, and, (iii) when the
frequency $f$ of the power supply increases, the voltage-current pinched
hysteresis characteristic tends closer to a single-valued one, meaning that the
voltage-current graph becomes that of a resistor (with an increased linearity
for $f\rightarrow \infty$). The conductance $g$ of the Cassie-Mayr model
decreases when the frequency increases. The hybrid Cassie-Mayr model describes
therefore an interesting case of a memristive phenomenon.
"
612,IRLS and Slime Mold: Equivalence and Convergence,"  In this paper we present a connection between two dynamical systems arising
in entirely different contexts: one in signal processing and the other in
biology. The first is the famous Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares (IRLS)
algorithm used in compressed sensing and sparse recovery while the second is
the dynamics of a slime mold (Physarum polycephalum). Both of these dynamics
are geared towards finding a minimum l1-norm solution in an affine subspace.
Despite its simplicity the convergence of the IRLS method has been shown only
for a certain regularization of it and remains an important open problem. Our
first result shows that the two dynamics are projections of the same dynamical
system in higher dimensions. As a consequence, and building on the recent work
on Physarum dynamics, we are able to prove convergence and obtain complexity
bounds for a damped version of the IRLS algorithm.
"
613,"Skyrmions as Compact, Robust and Energy-Efficient Interconnects for
  Domain Wall (DW)-based Systems","  Magnetic domain-wall (DW) has been widely investigated for future memory and
computing systems. However, energy efficiency and stability become two major
challenges of DW-based systems. In this letter, we first propose exploiting
skyrmions as on-chip and inter-chip interconnects for DW-based systems, owing
to the topological stability, small size and ultra-low depinning current
density. In the proposed technique, data are processed in the form of DWs but
are transmitted instead in the form of skyrmions. The reversible conversion
between a skyrmion and a DW pair can be physically achieved by connecting a
wide and a narrow magnetic nanowire. Our proposed technique can realize highly
compact, robust and energy-efficient on-chip and inter-chip interconnects for
DW-based systems, enabling the system to take advantages of both the DW and
skyrmion.
"
614,"Physical maze solvers. All twelve prototypes implement 1961 Lee
  algorithm","  We overview experimental laboratory prototypes of maze solvers. We speculate
that all maze solvers implement Lee algorithm by first developing a gradient of
values showing a distance from any site of the maze to the destination site and
then tracing a path from a given source site to the destination site. All
prototypes approximate a set of many-source-one-destination paths using
resistance, chemical and temporal gradients. They trace a path from a given
source site to the destination site using electrical current, fluidic, growth
of slime mould, Marangoni flow, crawling of epithelial cells, excitation waves
in chemical medium, propagating crystallisation patterns. Some of the
prototypes visualise the path using a stream of dye, thermal camera or glow
discharge; others require a computer to extract the path from time lapse images
of the tracing. We discuss the prototypes in terms of speed, costs and
durability of the path visualisation.
"
615,"Wi-Fi/WiGig Coordination for Optimal WiGig Concurrent Transmissions in
  Random Access Scenario","  Wireless Gigabit (WiGig) access points (APs) using 60 GHz unlicensed
frequency band are considered as key enablers for future Gbps WLANs. Due to its
short range transmission with high susceptibility to path blocking, a multiple
number of WiGig APs should be installed to fully cover a typical target
environment. However, using autonomously operated WiGig APs with IEEE 802.11ad
DCF, the exhaustive search analog beamforming and the maximum received power
based autonomous users association prevent the establishment of optimal WiGig
concurrent links that maximize the total system throughput in random access
scenarios. In this paper, we formulate the problem of WiGig concurrent
transmissions in random access scenarios as an optimization problem, then we
propose a Wi-Fi/WiGig coordination architecture to solve it. The proposed
coordinated Wi-Fi/WiGig WLAN is based on a tight coordination between the 5 GHz
(Wi-Fi) and the 60 GHz (WiGig) unlicensed frequency bands. By which, the wide
coverage Wi-Fi band controls the establishment of the WiGig concurrent links.
Statistical learning using Wi-Fi fingerprinting is used for estimating the best
candidate AP and its best beam identification (ID) for establishing the WiGig
concurrent link without making any interference to the existing WiGig data
links.
"
616,"Combined Compute and Storage: Configurable Memristor Arrays to
  Accelerate Search","  Emerging technologies present opportunities for system designers to meet the
challenges presented by competing trends of big data analytics and limitations
on CMOS scaling. Specifically, memristors are an emerging high-density
technology where the individual memristors can be used as storage or to perform
computation. The voltage applied across a memristor determines its behavior
(storage vs. compute), which enables a configurable memristor substrate that
can embed computation with storage.
  This paper explores accelerating point and range search queries as instances
of the more general configurable combined compute and storage capabilities of
memristor arrays. We first present MemCAM, a configurable memristor-based
content addressable memory for the cases when fast, infrequent searches over
large datasets are required. For frequent searches, memristor lifetime becomes
a concern. To increase memristor array lifetime we introduce hybrid data
structures that combine trees with MemCAM using conventional CMOS
processor/cache hierarchies for the upper levels of the tree and configurable
memristor technologies for lower levels.
  We use SPICE to analyze energy consumption and access time of memristors and
use analytic models to evaluate the performance of configurable hybrid data
structures. The results show that with acceptable energy consumption our
configurable hybrid data structures improve performance of search intensive
applications and achieve lifetime in years or decades under continuous queries.
Furthermore, the configurability of memristor arrays and the proposed data
structures provide opportunities to tune the trade- off between performance and
lifetime and the data structures can be easily adapted to future memristors or
other technologies with improved endurance.
"
617,"Towards Programmable Network Dynamics: A Chemistry-Inspired Abstraction
  for Hardware Design","  Chemical algorithms are statistical algorithms described and represented as
chemical reaction networks. They are particularly attractive for traffic
shaping and general control of network dynamics; they are analytically
tractable, they reinforce a strict state-to-dynamics relationship, they have
configurable stability properties, and they are directly implemented in
state-space using a high-level (graphical) representation.
  In this paper, we present a direct implementation of chemical algorithms on
FPGA hardware. Besides substantially improving performance, we have achieved
hardware-level programmability and re-configurability of these algorithms at
runtime (not interrupting servicing) and in realtime (with sub-second latency).
This opens an interesting perspective for expanding the currently limited scope
of software defined networking and network virtualisation solutions, to include
programmable control of network dynamics.
"
618,"TiO2 based Nanostructured Memristor for RRAM and Neuromorphic
  Applications: A Simulation Approach","  We report simulation of nanostructured memristor device using piecewise
linear and nonlinear window functions for RRAM and neuromorphic applications.
The linear drift model of memristor has been exploited for the simulation
purpose with the linear and non-linear window function as the mathematical and
scripting basis. The results evidences that the piecewise linear window
function can aptly simulate the memristor characteristics pertaining to RRAM
application. However, the nonlinear window function could exhibit the nonlinear
phenomenon in simulation only at the lower magnitude of control parameter. This
has motivated us to propose a new nonlinear window function for emulating the
simulation model of the memristor. Interestingly, the proposed window function
is scalable up to f(x)=1 and exhibits the nonlinear behavior at higher
magnitude of control parameter. Moreover, the simulation results of proposed
nonlinear window function are encouraging and reveals the smooth nonlinear
change from LRS to HRS and vice versa and therefore useful for the neuromorphic
applications.
"
619,Posner computing: a quantum neural network model,"  We present a construction, rendered in Quipper, of a quantum algorithm which
probabilistically computes a classical function from n bits to n bits. The
construction is intended to be of interest primarily for the features of
Quipper it highlights. However, intrigued by the utility of quantum information
processing in the context of neural networks, we present the algorithm as a
simplest example of a particular quantum neural network which we first define.
As the definition is inspired by recent work of Fisher concerning possible
quantum substrates to cognition, we precede it with a short description of that
work.
"
620,Unsupervised Learning in Neuromemristive Systems,"  Neuromemristive systems (NMSs) currently represent the most promising
platform to achieve energy efficient neuro-inspired computation. However, since
the research field is less than a decade old, there are still countless
algorithms and design paradigms to be explored within these systems. One
particular domain that remains to be fully investigated within NMSs is
unsupervised learning. In this work, we explore the design of an NMS for
unsupervised clustering, which is a critical element of several machine
learning algorithms. Using a simple memristor crossbar architecture and
learning rule, we are able to achieve performance which is on par with MATLAB's
k-means clustering.
"
621,"Reversible Logic Circuit Complexity Analysis via Functional
  Decomposition","  Reversible computation is gaining increasing relevance in the context of
several post-CMOS technologies, the most prominent of those being Quantum
computing. One of the key theoretical problem pertaining to reversible logic
synthesis is the upper bound of the gate count. Compared to the known bounds,
the results obtained by optimal synthesis methods are significantly less. In
this paper, we connect this problem with the multiplicative complexity analysis
of classical Boolean functions. We explore the possibility of relaxing the
ancilla and if that approach makes the upper bound tighter. Our results are
negative. The ancilla-free synthesis methods by using transformations and by
starting from an Exclusive Sum-of-Product (ESOP) formulation remain,
theoretically, the synthesis methods for achieving least gate count for the
cases where the number of variables $n$ is $< 8$ and otherwise, respectively.
"
622,Simple fluidic digital half-adder,"  A fluidic one-bit half-adder is made of five channels which intersect at a
junction. Two channels are inputs, two channels are outputs and one channel is
the drain. The channels direct fluid from input fragments to output fragments
and the streams of fluid interact at the junctions. Binary signals are
represented by water droplets introduced in the input channels: presence of a
droplet in an input or output segments symbolises logical {\sc True}, absence
--- {\sc False}. The droplets travel along channels by following a path of
least resistance unless deflected at the junction. We demonstrate the function
of the half-adder in both computer modelling and laboratory experiments, and
propose a design of a one-bit full adder based on simulation.
"
623,Design of Geometric Molecular Bonds,"  An example of a nonspecific molecular bond is the affinity of any positive
charge for any negative charge (like-unlike), or of nonpolar material for
itself when in aqueous solution (like-like). This contrasts specific bonds such
as the affinity of the DNA base A for T, but not for C, G, or another A. Recent
experimental breakthroughs in DNA nanotechnology demonstrate that a particular
nonspecific like-like bond (""blunt-end DNA stacking"" that occurs between the
ends of any pair of DNA double-helices) can be used to create specific
""macrobonds"" by careful geometric arrangement of many nonspecific blunt ends,
motivating the need for sets of macrobonds that are orthogonal: two macrobonds
not intended to bind should have relatively low binding strength, even when
misaligned.
  To address this need, we introduce geometric orthogonal codes that abstractly
model the engineered DNA macrobonds as two-dimensional binary codewords. While
motivated by completely different applications, geometric orthogonal codes
share similar features to the optical orthogonal codes studied by Chung,
Salehi, and Wei. The main technical difference is the importance of 2D geometry
in defining codeword orthogonality.
"
624,"Investigating Reliability Aspects of Memristor based RRAM with Reference
  to Write Voltage and Frequency","  In this paper, we report the effect of write voltage and frequency on
memristor based Resistive Random Access Memory (RRAM). The above said
parameters have been investigated on the linear drift model of memristor. With
a variation of write voltage from 0.2V to 1.2V and a subsequent frequency
modulation from 1, 2, 4, 10, 100 and 200 Hz the corresponding effects on memory
window, Low Resistance State (LRS) and High Resistance State (HRS) have been
reported. Thus the lifetime ({\tau}) reliability analysis of memristor based
RRAM is carried out using above results. It is found that, the HRS is
independent of write voltage, whereas LRS shows dependency on write voltage and
frequency. The simulation results showcase that the memristor possess higher
memory window and lifetime ({\tau}) in the higher voltage with lower frequency
region, which has been attributed to the fewer data losses in the memory
architecture.
"
625,"A Processing In-Memory Realization Using QCA: Proposal and
  Implementation","  Processing in Memory (PIM) is a computing paradigm that promises enormous
gain in processing speed by eradicating latencies in the typical von Neumann
architecture. It has gained popularity owing to its throughput by embedding
storage and computation of data in a single unit. We portray implementation of
Akers array architecture endowed with PIM computation using Quantum-dot
Cellular Automata (QCA). We present the proof of concept of PIM with its
realization in the QCA designer paradigm. We illustrate implementation of Ex-OR
gate with the help of QCA based Akers Array and put forth many interesting
potential possibilities.
"
626,"Optimal and asymptotically optimal NCT reversible circuits by the gate
  types","  We report optimal and asymptotically optimal reversible circuits composed of
NOT, CNOT, and Toffoli (NCT) gates, keeping the count by the subsets of the
gate types used. This study fine tunes the circuit complexity figures for the
realization of reversible functions via reversible NCT circuits. An important
consequence is a result on the limitation of the use of the $T$-count quantum
circuit metric popular in applications.
"
627,"Response to ""Comment on 'Zero and negative energy dissipation at
  information-theoretic erasure'""","  We prove that statistical information theoretic quantities, such as
information entropy, cannot generally be interrelated with the lower limit of
energy dissipation during information erasure. We also point out that, in
deterministic and error-free computers, the information entropy of memories
does not change during erasure because its value is always zero. On the other
hand, for information-theoretic erasure - i.e., ""thermalization"" /
randomization of the memory - the originally zero information entropy (with
deterministic data in the memory) changes after erasure to its maximum value, 1
bit / memory bit, while the energy dissipation is still positive, even at
parameters for which the thermodynamic entropy within the memory cell does not
change. Information entropy does not convert to thermodynamic entropy and to
the related energy dissipation; they are quantities of different physical
nature. Possible specific observations (if any) indicating convertibility are
at most fortuitous and due to the disregard of additional processes that are
present.
"
628,"The physical and circuit-theoretic significance of the Memristor : Full
  version","  It is observed that the inductive and capacitive features of the memristor
reflect (and are a quintessence of) such features of any resistor. The very
presence of the voltage and current state variables, associated by their
electrodynamics sense with electrical and magnetic fields, in the resistive
characteristic v = f(i), forces any resister to accumulate some magnetic and
electrostatic fields and energies around itself, i.e. L and C elements are
always present. From the circuit-theoretic point of view, the role of the
memristor is seen, first of all, in the elimination of the use of a unique
v(i). This makes circuits with hysteresis characteristics relevant, and also
suggests that the concept of memristor should influence the basic problem of
definition of nonlinearity. Since the memristor mainly originates from the
resistor, it was found necessary to overview some unusual cases of resistive
circuits. The present opinion is that the framework of basic circuit theory and
its connection with applications should be logically expanded in order to
naturally include the new element.
"
629,"Time and Frequency Domain Investigation of Selected Memristor based
  Analog Circuits","  In this paper, we investigate few memristor-based analog circuits namely the
phase shift oscillator, integrator, and differentiator which have been explored
numerously using the traditional lumped components. We use LTspice-IV platform
for simulation of the above-said circuits. The investigation resorts to the
nonlinear dopant drift model of memristor and the window function portrayed in
the literature for nonlinearity realization. The results of our investigations
depict good agreement with the conventional lumped component based phase shift
oscillator, integrator, and differentiator circuits. The results are evident to
showcase the potential of the memristor as a promising candidate for the next
generation analog circuits.
"
630,"State Space Analysis of Memristor Based Series and Parallel RLCM
  Circuits","  The present paper investigates state space analysis of memristor based series
and parallel RLCM circuits. The stability analysis is carried out with the help
of eigenvalues formulation method, pole-zero plot and transient response of
system. The state space analysis is successfully applied and eigenvalues of the
two circuits are calculated. It is found that the, system follows negative real
part of eigenvalues. The result clearly shows that addition of memristor in
circuits will not alter the stability of system. It is found that systems poles
located at left hand side of the S plane, which indicates stable performance of
system. It clearly evident that eigenvalues has negative real part hence two
systems are internally stable.
"
631,Strongly Universal Reversible Gate Sets,"  It is well-known that the Toffoli gate and the negation gate together yield a
universal gate set, in the sense that every permutation of $\{0,1\}^n$ can be
implemented as a composition of these gates. Since every bit operation that
does not use all of the bits performs an even permutation, we need to use at
least one auxiliary bit to perform every permutation, and it is known that one
bit is indeed enough. Without auxiliary bits, all even permutations can be
implemented. We generalize these results to non-binary logic: If $A$ is a
finite set of odd cardinality then a finite gate set can generate all
permutations of $A^n$ for all $n$, without any auxiliary symbols. If the
cardinality of $A$ is even then, by the same argument as above, only even
permutations of $A^n$ can be implemented for large $n$, and we show that indeed
all even permutations can be obtained from a finite universal gate set. We also
consider the conservative case, that is, those permutations of $A^n$ that
preserve the weight of the input word. The weight is the vector that records
how many times each symbol occurs in the word. It turns out that no finite
conservative gate set can, for all $n$, implement all conservative even
permutations of $A^n$ without auxiliary bits. But we provide a finite gate set
that can implement all those conservative permutations that are even within
each weight class of $A^n$.
"
632,"Fast IDS Computing System Method and its Memristor Crossbar-based
  Hardware Implementation","  Active Learning Method (ALM) is one of the powerful tools in soft computing
that is inspired by human brain capabilities in processing complicated
information. ALM, which is in essence an adaptive fuzzy learning method, models
a Multi-Input Single-Output (MISO) system with several Single-Input
Single-Output (SISO) subsystems. Ink Drop Spread (IDS) operator, which is the
main processing engine of this method, extracts useful features from the data
without complicated computations and provides stability and convergence as
well. Despite great performance of ALM in applications such as classification,
clustering, and modelling, an efficient hardware implementation has remained a
challenging problem. Large amount of memory required to store the information
of IDS planes as well as the high computational cost of the IDS computing
system are two main barriers to ALM becoming more popular. In this paper, a
novel learning method is proposed based on the idea of IDS, but with a novel
approach that eliminates the computational cost of IDS operator. Unlike
traditional approaches, our proposed method finds functions to describe the IDS
plane that eliminates the need for large amount of memory to a great extent.
Narrow Path and Spread, which are two main features used in the inference
engine of ALM, are then extracted from IDS planes with minimum amount of memory
usage and power consumption. Our proposed algorithm is fully compatible with
memristor-crossbar implementation that leads to a significant decrease in the
number of required memristors (from O(n^2) to O(3n)). Simpler algorithm and
higher speed make our algorithm suitable for applications where real-time
process, low-cost and small implementation are paramount. Applications in
clustering and function approximation are provided, which reveals the effective
performance of our proposed algorithm.

633,Complementary Skyrmion Racetrack Memory with Voltage Manipulation,"  Magnetic skyrmion holds promise as information carriers in the
next-generation memory and logic devices, owing to the topological stability,
small size and extremely low current needed to drive it. One of the most
potential applications of skyrmion is to design racetrack memory (RM), named
Sk-RM, instead of utilizing domain wall (DW). However, current studies face
some key design challenges, e.g., skyrmion manipulation, data representation
and synchronization etc. To address these challenges, we propose here a
complementary Sk-RM structure with voltage manipulation. Functionality and
performance of the proposed design are investigated with micromagnetic
simulations.

634,"Nanoscale artificial intelligence: creating artificial neural networks
  using autocatalytic reactions","  A general methodology is proposed to engineer a system of interacting
components (particles) which is able to self-regulate their concentrations in
order to produce any prescribed output in response to a particular input. The
methodology is based on the mathematical equivalence between artificial neurons
in neural networks and species in autocatalytic reactions, and it specifies the
relationship between the artificial neural network's parameters and the rate
coefficients of the reactions between particle species. Such systems are
characterised by a high degree of robustness as they are able to reach the
desired output despite disturbances and perturbations of the concentrations of
the various species.
"
635,Verified compilation of space-efficient reversible circuits,"  The generation of reversible circuits from high-level code is an important
problem in several application domains, including low-power electronics and
quantum computing. Existing tools compile and optimize reversible circuits for
various metrics, such as the overall circuit size or the total amount of space
required to implement a given function reversibly. However, little effort has
been spent on verifying the correctness of the results, an issue of particular
importance in quantum computing. There, compilation allows not only mapping to
hardware, but also the estimation of resources required to implement a given
quantum algorithm, a process that is crucial for identifying which algorithms
will outperform their classical counterparts. We present a reversible circuit
compiler called ReVerC, which has been formally verified in F* and compiles
circuits that operate correctly with respect to the input program. Our compiler
compiles the Revs language to combinational reversible circuits with as few
ancillary bits as possible, and provably cleans temporary values.

636,"Type Based Sign Modulation and its Application for ISI mitigation in
  Molecular Communication","  An important challenge in design of modulation schemes for molecular
communication is positivity of the transmission signal (only a positive
concentration of molecules can be released in the environment). This
restriction makes handling of the InterSymbol Interference (ISI) a challenge
for molecular communication. Previous works have proposed use of chemical
reactions to remove molecules from the environment, and to effectively simulate
negative signals. However, the differential equation describing a
diffusion-reaction process is non-linear. This precludes the possibility of
using Fourier transform tools. In this paper, a solution for simulating
negative signals based on the diffusion-reaction channel model is proposed.
While the proposed solution does not exploit the full degrees of freedom
available for signaling in a diffusion-reaction process, but its end-to-end
system is a linear channel and amenable to Fourier transform analysis. Based on
our solution, a modulation scheme and a precoder are introduced and shown to
have a significant reduction in error probability compared to previous
modulation schemes such as CSK and MCSK. The effect of various imperfections
(such as quantization error) on the communication system performance are
studied.

637,"A Real-Time and Energy-Efficient Implementation of
  Difference-of-Gaussian with Flexible Thin-Film Transistors","  With many advantageous features, softness and better biocompatibility,
flexible electronic devices have developed rapidly and increasingly attracted
attention. Many currently applications with flexible devices are sensors and
drivers, while there is nearly no utilization aiming at complex computation
since flexible devices have lower electron mobility, simple structure and large
process variation. In this paper, we proposed an innovative method that enabled
flexible devices to implement real-time and energy-efficient
Difference-of-Gaussian, which illustrated feasibility and potentials for them
to achieve complicated real-time computation in future generation products.

638,"Wireless Information and Power Transfer in Full-Duplex Communication
  Systems","  This paper considers the problem of maximizing the sum-rate for simultaneous
wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) in a full-duplex bi-directional
communication system subject to energy harvesting and transmit power
constraints at both nodes. We investigate the optimum design of the receive
power splitters and transmit powers for SWIPT in full-duplex mode. Exploiting
rate-split method, an iterative algorithm is derived to solve the non-convex
problem. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is justified through
numerical simulations.
"
639,Continuous Molecular Communication in one dimensional situation,"  Molecular Communication as the most potential methods to solve the
communication in nano scale, for it's derived from nature, and it becomes more
and more prevalent. Though molecular communication happens in three dimensional
situation, there are also some situation that are in the one dimensional
situation, especially when considering the transmitters and the receivers are
in extremely short distance or in long slim pipe. In this paper, we introduce
the one dimensional situation, and studied how the continuous information
molecules transmitted in this situation, also introduced how to encode and
decode the information molecules, and based on the molecular communication
model, we studied some metrics of it, such as the distance between transmitter
and receiver, the emitting frequency of transmitter. Through the research we
know that the distance and frequency are important metrics to the successful
communication, which can direct us how to place the nano transmitters and
receivers in the future nano network environment.
"
640,"A Vertical Channel Model of Molecular Communication based on Alcohol
  Molecules","  The study of Molecular Communication(MC) is more and more prevalence, and
channel model of MC plays an important role in the MC System. Since different
propagation environment and modulation techniques produce different channel
model, most of the research about MC are in horizontal direction,but in nature
the communications between nano machines are in short range and some of the
information transportation are in the vertical direction, such as transpiration
of plants, biological pump in ocean, and blood transportation from heart to
brain. Therefore, this paper we propose a vertical channel model which
nano-machines communicate with each other in the vertical direction based on
pure diffusion. We first propose a vertical molecular communication model, we
mainly considered the gravity as the factor, though the channel model is also
affected by other main factors, such as the flow of the medium, the distance
between the transmitter and the receiver, the delay or sensitivity of the
transmitter and the receiver. Secondly, we set up a test-bed for this vertical
channel model, in order to verify the difference between the theory result and
the experiment data. At last, we use the data we get from the experiment and
the non-linear least squares method to get the parameters to make our channel
model more accurate.
"
641,Molecular MIMO: From Theory to Prototype,"  In diffusion-based molecular communication, information transport is governed
by diffusion through a fluid medium. The achievable data rates for these
channels are very low compared to the radio-based communication system, since
diffusion can be a slow process. To improve the data rate, a novel
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) design for molecular communication is
proposed that utilizes multiple molecular emitters at the transmitter and
multiple molecular detectors at the receiver (in RF communication these all
correspond to antennas). Using particle-based simulators, the channel's impulse
response is obtained and mathematically modeled. These models are then used to
determine inter-link interference (ILI) and inter-symbol interference (ISI). It
is assumed that when the receiver has incomplete information regarding the
system and the channel state, low complexity symbol detection methods are
preferred since the receiver is small and simple. Thus four detection
algorithms are proposed---adaptive thresholding, practical zero forcing with
channel models excluding/including the ILI and ISI, and Genie-aided zero
forcing. The proposed algorithms are evaluated extensively using numerical and
analytical evaluations.
"
642,"Information Processing by Nonlinear Phase Dynamics in Locally Connected
  Arrays","  Research toward powerful information processing systems that circumvent the
interconnect bottleneck by exploiting the nonlinear evolution of multiple phase
dynamics in locally connected arrays is discussed. We focus on a scheme in
which logic states are defined by the electrical phase of a dynamic process and
information processing is realized through interactions between the elements in
the array. Simulation results are given for networks comprised of neuron-like
integrate-and-fire elements, which could potentially be implemented by
ultra-small tunnel junctions, molecules and other types of nanoscale elements.
This approach could lead to powerful information processing systems due to
massive parallelism in simple, highly scalable nano-architectures. The rational
for this approach, its advantages, simulation results, critical issues, and
future research directions are discussed.
"
643,Digital IP Protection Using Threshold Voltage Control,"  This paper proposes a method to completely hide the functionality of a
digital standard cell. This is accomplished by a differential threshold logic
gate (TLG). A TLG with $n$ inputs implements a subset of Boolean functions of
$n$ variables that are linear threshold functions. The output of such a gate is
one if and only if an integer weighted linear arithmetic sum of the inputs
equals or exceeds a given integer threshold. We present a novel architecture of
a TLG that not only allows a single TLG to implement a large number of complex
logic functions, which would require multiple levels of logic when implemented
using conventional logic primitives, but also allows the selection of that
subset of functions by assignment of the transistor threshold voltages to the
input transistors. To obfuscate the functionality of the TLG, weights of some
inputs are set to zero by setting their device threshold to be a high $V_t$.
The threshold voltage of the remaining transistors is set to low $V_t$ to
increase their transconductance. The function of a TLG is not determined by the
cell itself but rather the signals that are connected to its inputs. This makes
it possible to hide the support set of the function by essentially removing
some variable from the support set of the function by selective assignment of
high and low $V_t$ to the input transistors. We describe how a standard cell
library of TLGs can be mixed with conventional standard cells to realize
complex logic circuits, whose function can never be discovered by reverse
engineering. A 32-bit Wallace tree multiplier and a 28-bit 4-tap filter were
synthesized on an ST 65nm process, placed and routed, then simulated including
extracted parastics with and without obfuscation. Both obfuscated designs had
much lower area (25%) and much lower dynamic power (30%) than their
nonobfuscated CMOS counterparts, operating at the same frequency.
"
644,Basic circuit compilation techniques for an ion-trap quantum machine,"  We study the problem of compilation of quantum algorithms into optimized
physical-level circuits executable in a quantum information processing (QIP)
experiment based on trapped atomic ions. We report a complete strategy:
starting with an algorithm in the form of a quantum computer program, we
compile it into a high-level logical circuit that goes through multiple stages
of decomposition into progressively lower-level circuits until we reach the
physical execution-level specification. We skip the fault-tolerance layer, as
it is not within the scope of this work. The different stages are structured so
as to best assist with the overall optimization while taking into account
numerous optimization criteria, including minimizing the number of expensive
two-qubit gates, minimizing the number of less expensive single-qubit gates,
optimizing the runtime, minimizing the overall circuit error, and optimizing
classical control sequences. Our approach allows a trade-off between circuit
runtime and quantum error, as well as to accommodate future changes in the
optimization criteria that may likely arise as a result of the anticipated
improvements in the physical-level control of the experiment.
"
645,"Synchronization in Networks of Identical Systems via Pinning:
  Application to Distributed Secondary Control of Microgrids","  Motivated by the need for fast synchronized operation of power microgrids, we
analyze the problem of single and multiple pinning in networked systems. We
derive lower and upper bounds on the algebraic connectivity of the network with
respect to the reference signal. These bounds are utilized to devise a
suboptimal algorithm with polynomial complexity to find a suitable set of nodes
to pin the network effectively and efficiently. The results are applied to
secondary voltage pinning control design for a microgrid in islanded operation
mode. Comparisons with existing single and multiple pinning strategies clearly
demonstrates the efficacy of the obtained results.
"
646,"Effect of Jitter on the Settling Time of Mesochronous Clock Retiming
  Circuits","  It is well known that timing jitter can degrade the bit error rate (BER) of
receivers that recover the clock from input data. However, timing jitter can
also result in an indefinite increase in the settling time of clock recovery
circuits, particularly in low swing mesochronous systems. Mesochronous clock
retiming circuits are required in repeaterless low swing on-chip interconnects.
We first discuss how timing jitter can result in a large increase in the
settling time of the clock recovery circuit. Next, the circuit is modelled as a
Markov chain with absorbing states. The mean time to absorption of the Markov
chain, which represents the mean settling time of the circuit, is determined.
The model is validated through behavioural simulations of the circuit, the
results of which match well with the model predictions. We consider circuits
with (i) data dependent jitter, (ii) random jitter, and (iii) combination of
both of them. We show that a mismatch between the strengths of up and down
corrections of the retiming can reduce the settling time. In particular, a 10%
mismatch can reduce the mean settling time by up to 40%. We leverage this fact
toward improving the settling time performance, and propose useful techniques
based on biased training sequences and mismatched charge pumps. We also present
a coarse+fine clock retiming circuit, which can operate in coarse first mode,
to reduce the settling time substantially. These fast settling retiming
circuits are verified with circuit simulations.
"
647,Multi-objective design of quantum circuits using genetic programming,"  Quantum computing is a new way of data processing based on the concept of
quantum mechanics. Quantum circuit design is a process of converting a quantum
gate to a series of basic gates and is divided into two general categories
based on the decomposition and composition. In the second group, using
evolutionary algorithms and especially genetic algorithms, multiplication of
matrix gates was used to achieve the final characteristic of quantum circuit.
Genetic programming is a subfield of evolutionary computing in which computer
programs evolve to solve studied problems. In past research that has been done
in the field of quantum circuits design, only one cost metrics (usually quantum
cost) has been investigated. In this paper for the first time, a
multi-objective approach has been provided to design quantum circuits using
genetic programming that considers the depth and the cost of nearest neighbor
metrics in addition to quantum cost metric. Another innovation of this article
is the use of two-step fitness function and taking into account the equivalence
of global phase in quantum gates. The results show that the proposed method is
able to find a good answer in a short time.
"
648,Reversible k-valued logic circuits are finitely generated for odd k,"  In his 2003 paper ""Towards an algebraic theory of Boolean circuits"", Lafont
notes that the class of reversible circuits over a set of k truth values is
finitely generated when k is odd. He cites a private communication for the
proof. The purpose of this short note is to make the content of that
communication available.
"
649,A finite alternation result for reversible boolean circuits,"  We say that a reversible boolean function on n bits has alternation depth d
if it can be written as the sequential composition of d reversible boolean
functions, each of which acts only on the top n-1 bits or on the bottom n-1
bits. Moreover, if the functions on n-1 bits are even, we speak of even
alternation depth. We show that every even reversible boolean function of n >=
4 bits has alternation depth at most 9 and even alternation depth at most 13.
"
650,Detector Based Radio Tomographic Imaging,"  Received signal strength based radio tomographic imaging is a popular
device-free indoor localization method which reconstructs the spatial loss
field of the environment using measurements from a dense wireless network.
Existing methods solve an associated inverse problem using algebraic or
compressed sensing reconstruction algorithms. We propose an alternative imaging
method that reconstructs spatial field of occupancy using a back-projection
based reconstruction algorithm. The introduced system has the following
advantages over the other imaging based methods: i.) significantly lower
computational complexity such that no floating point multiplication is
required; ii.) each link's measured data is compressed to a single bit,
providing improved scalability; iii.) physically significant and repeatable
parameters. The proposed method is validated using measurement data. Results
show that the proposed method achieves the above advantages without loss of
accuracy compared to the other available methods.
"
651,"Democratic, Existential, and Consensus-Based Output Conventions in
  Stable Computation by Chemical Reaction Networks","  We show that some natural output conventions for error-free computation in
chemical reaction networks (CRN) lead to a common level of computational
expressivity. Our main results are that the standard consensus-based output
convention have equivalent computational power to (1) existence-based and (2)
democracy-based output conventions. The CRNs using the former output convention
have only ""yes"" voters, with the interpretation that the CRN's output is yes if
any voters are present and no otherwise. The CRNs using the latter output
convention define output by majority vote among ""yes"" and ""no"" voters.
  Both results are proven via a generalized framework that simultaneously
captures several definitions, directly inspired by a Petri net result of
Esparza, Ganty, Leroux, and Majumder [CONCUR 2015]. These results support the
thesis that the computational expressivity of error-free CRNs is intrinsic, not
sensitive to arbitrary definitional choices.
"
652,"Enhanced Circuit Densities in Epitaxially Defined FinFETs (EDFinFETs)
  over FinFETs","  FinFET technology is prone to suffer from Line Edge Roughness (LER) based VT
variation with scaling. To address this, we proposed an Epitaxially Defined
(ED) FinFET (EDFinFET) as an alternate to FinFET architecture for 10 nm node
and beyond. We showed by statistical simulations that EDFinFET reduces LER
based VT variability by 90% and overall variability by 59%. However, EDFinFET
consists of wider fins as the fin widths are not constrained by electrostatics
and variability (cf. FinFETs have fin width ~ LG/3 where LG is gate-length).
This indicates that EDFinFET based circuits may be less dense. In this study we
show that wide fins enable taller fin heights. The ability to engineer multiple
STI levels on tall fins enables different transistor widths (i.e. various W/Ls
e.g. 1-10) in a single fin. This capability ensures that even though individual
EDFinFET devices have ~2x larger footprints than FinFETs, EDFinFET may produce
equal or higher circuit density for basic building blocks like inverters or
NAND gates for W/Ls of 2 and higher.
"
653,"A Proposal for Energy-Efficient Cellular Neural Network based on
  Spintronic Devices","  Due to the massive parallel computing capability and outstanding image and
signal processing performance, cellular neural network (CNN) is one promising
type of non-Boolean computing system that can outperform the traditional
digital logic computation and mitigate the physical scaling limit of the
conventional CMOS technology. The CNN was originally implemented by VLSI analog
technologies with operational amplifiers and operational transconductance
amplifiers as neurons and synapses, respectively, which are power and area
consuming. In this paper, we propose a hybrid structure to implement the CNN
with magnetic components and CMOS peripherals with a complete driving and
sensing circuitry. In addition, we propose a digitally programmable magnetic
synapse that can achieve both positive and negative values of the templates.
After rigorous performance analyses and comparisons, optimal energy is achieved
based on various design parameters, including the driving voltage and the CMOS
driving size. At a comparable footprint area and operation speed, a spintronic
CNN is projected to achieve more than one order of magnitude energy reduction
per operation compared to its CMOS counterpart.
"
654,"Active Versus Passive: Receiver Model Transforms for Diffusive Molecular
  Communication","  This paper presents an analytical comparison of active and passive receiver
models in diffusive molecular communication. In the active model, molecules are
absorbed when they collide with the receiver surface. In the passive model, the
receiver is a virtual boundary that does not affect molecule behavior. Two
approaches are presented to derive transforms between the receiver signals. As
an example, two models for an unbounded diffusion-only molecular communication
system with a spherical receiver are unified. As time increases in the
three-dimensional system, the transform functions have constant scaling
factors, such that the receiver models are effectively equivalent. Methods are
presented to enable the transformation of stochastic simulations, which are
used to verify the transforms and demonstrate that transforming the simulation
of a passive receiver can be more efficient and more accurate than the direct
simulation of an absorbing receiver.
"
655,"Channel Impulse Responses in Diffusive Molecular Communication with
  Spherical Transmitters","  Molecular communication is an emerging paradigm for systems that rely on the
release of molecules as information carriers. Communication via molecular
diffusion is a popular strategy that is ubiquitous in nature and very fast over
distances on the order of a micron or less. Existing closed-form analysis of
the diffusion channel impulse response generally assumes that the transmitter
is a point source. In this paper, channel impulse responses are derived for
spherical transmitters with either a passive or absorbing receiver. The derived
channel impulse responses are in closed-form for a one-dimensional environment
and can be found via numerical integration for a three-dimensional environment.
The point transmitter assumption (PTA) is formally defined so that its accuracy
can be measured in comparison to the derived spherical transmitter impulse
responses. The spherical transmitter model is much more accurate than the PTA
when the distance between a transmitter and its receiver is small relative to
the size of the transmitter. The derived results are verified via microscopic
particle-based simulations using the molecular communication simulation
platform AcCoRD (Actor-based Communication via Reaction-Diffusion). A spherical
transmitter variation where molecules are released from the surface of a solid
sphere is also considered via simulation.
"
656,"Effective inter-symbol interference mitigation with a limited amount of
  enzymes in molecular communications","  In molecular communication via diffusion (MCvD), the inter-symbol
interference (ISI) is a well known severe problem that deteriorates both data
rates and link reliability. ISI mainly occurs due to the slow and highly random
propagation of the messenger molecules, which causes the emitted molecules from
the previous symbols to interfere with molecules from the current symbol. An
effective way to mitigate the ISI is using enzymes to degrade undesired
molecules. Prior work on ISI mitigation by enzymes has assumed an infinite
amount of enzymes randomly distributed around the molecular channel. Taking a
different approach, this paper assumes an MCvD channel with a limited amount of
enzymes. The main question this paper addresses is how to deploy these enzymes
in an effective structure so that ISI mitigation is maximized. To find an
effective MCvD channel environment, this study considers optimization of the
shape of the transmitter node, the deployment location and structure, the size
of the enzyme deployed area, and the half-lives of the enzymes. It also
analyzes the dependence of the optimum size of the enzyme area on the distance
and half-life.
"
657,One-Way Quantum Computer Simulation,"  In one-way quantum computation (1WQC) model, universal quantum computations
are performed using measurements to designated qubits in a highly entangled
state. The choices of bases for these measurements as well as the structure of
the entanglements specify a quantum algorithm. As scalable and reliable quantum
computers have not been implemented yet, quantum computation simulators are the
only widely available tools to design and test quantum algorithms. However,
simulating the quantum computations on a standard classical computer in most
cases requires exponential memory and time. In this paper, a general direct
simulator for 1WQC, called OWQS, is presented. Some techniques such as qubit
elimination, pattern reordering and implicit simulation of actions are used to
considerably reduce the time and memory needed for the simulations. Moreover,
our simulator is adjusted to simulate the measurement patterns with a
generalized flow without calculating the measurement probabilities which is
called extended one-way quantum computation simulator (EOWQS). Experimental
results validate the feasibility of the proposed simulators and that OWQS and
EOWQS are faster as compared with the well-known quantum circuit simulators,
i.e., QuIDDPro and libquantum for simulating 1WQC model.
"
658,CLAASIC: a Cortex-Inspired Hardware Accelerator,"  This work explores the feasibility of specialized hardware implementing the
Cortical Learning Algorithm (CLA) in order to fully exploit its inherent
advantages. This algorithm, which is inspired in the current understanding of
the mammalian neo-cortex, is the basis of the Hierarchical Temporal Memory
(HTM). In contrast to other machine learning (ML) approaches, the structure is
not application dependent and relies on fully unsupervised continuous learning.
We hypothesize that a hardware implementation will be able not only to extend
the already practical uses of these ideas to broader scenarios but also to
exploit the hardware-friendly CLA characteristics. The architecture proposed
will enable an unfeasible scalability for software solutions and will fully
capitalize on one of the many CLA advantages: low computational requirements
and reduced storage utilization. Compared to a state-of-the-art CLA software
implementation it could be possible to improve by 4 orders of magnitude in
performance and up to 8 orders of magnitude in energy efficiency. We propose to
use a packet-switched network to tackle this. The paper addresses the
fundamental issues of such an approach, proposing solutions to achieve scalable
solutions. We will analyze cost and performance when using well-known
architecture techniques and tools. The results obtained suggest that even with
CMOS technology, under constrained cost, it might be possible to implement a
large-scale system. We found that the proposed solutions enable a saving of 90%
of the original communication costs running either synthetic or realistic
workloads.
"
659,On the Capacity of Diffusion-Based Molecular Timing Channels,"  This work introduces capacity limits for molecular timing (MT) channels,
where information is modulated on the release timing of small information
particles, and decoded from the time of arrival at the receiver. It is shown
that the random time of arrival can be represented as an additive noise
channel, and for the diffusion-based MT (DBMT) channel, this noise is
distributed according to the L\'evy distribution. Lower and upper bounds on the
capacity of the DBMT channel are derived for the case where the delay
associated with the propagation of information particles in the channel is
finite. These bounds are also shown to be tight.
"
660,A Survey of Memristive Threshold Logic Circuits,"  In this paper, we review the different memristive threshold logic (MTL)
circuits that are inspired from the synaptic action of flow of
neurotransmitters in the biological brain. Brain like generalisation ability
and area minimisation of these threshold logic circuits aim towards crossing
the Moores law boundaries at device, circuits and systems levels.Fast switching
memory, signal processing, control systems, programmable logic, image
processing, reconfigurable computing, and pattern recognition are identified as
some of the potential applications of MTL systems. The physical realization of
nanoscale devices with memristive behaviour from materials like TiO2,
ferroelectrics, silicon, and polymers has accelerated research effort in these
application areas inspiring the scientific community to pursue design of high
speed, low cost, low power and high density neuromorphic architectures.
"
661,Analog computing by Brewster effect,"  Optical computing has emerged as a promising candidate for real-time and
parallel continuous data processing. Motivated by recent progresses in
metamaterial-based analog computing [Science 343, 160 (2014)], we theoretically
investigate realization of two-dimensional complex mathematical operations
using rotated configurations, recently reported in [Opt. Lett. 39, 1278
(2014)]. Breaking the reflection symmetry, such configurations could realize
both even and odd Green's functions associated with spatial operators. Based on
such appealing theory and by using Brewster effect, we demonstrate realization
of a first-order differentiator. Such efficient wave-based computation method
not only circumvents the major potential drawbacks of metamaterials, but also
offers the most compact possible device compared to the conventional bulky
lens-based optical signal and data processors.
"
662,Programmable Crossbar Quantum-dot Cellular Automata Circuits,"  Quantum-dot fabrication and characterization is a well-established
technology, which is used in photonics, quantum optics and nanoelectronics.
Four quantum-dots placed at the corners of a square form a unit cell, which can
hold a bit of information and serve as a basis for Quantum-dot Cellular
Automata (QCA) nanoelectronic circuits. Although several basic QCA circuits
have been designed, fabricated and tested, proving that quantum-dots can form
functional, fast and low-power nanoelectornic circuits, QCA nanoelectronics
still remain at its infancy. One of the reasons for this is the lack of design
automation tools, which will facilitate the systematic design of large QCA
circuits that contemporary applications demand. Here we present novel,
programmable QCA circuits, which are based on crossbar architecture. These
circuits can be programmed to implement any Boolean function in analogy to CMOS
FPGAs and open the road that will lead to full design automation of QCA
nanoelectronic circuits. Using this architecture we designed and simulated QCA
circuits that proved to be area efficient, stable and reliable.
"
663,"Skybridge-3D-CMOS: A Vertically-Composed Fine-Grained 3D CMOS Integrated
  Circuit Technology","  Parallel and monolithic 3D integration directions offer pathways to realize
3D integrated circuits (ICs) but still lead to layer-by-layer implementations,
each functional layer being composed in 2D first. This mindset causes
challenging connectivity, routing and layer alignment between layers when
connected in 3D, with a routing access that can be even worse than 2D CMOS,
which fundamentally limits their potential. To fully exploit the opportunities
in the third dimension, we propose Skybridge-3D-CMOS (S3DC), a fine-grained 3D
integration approach that is directly composed in 3D, utilizing the vertical
dimension vs. using a layer-by-layer assembly mindset. S3DC uses a novel wafer
fabric creation with direct 3D design and connectivity in the vertical
dimension. It builds on a uniform vertical nanowire template that is processed
as a single wafer; it incorporates specifically architected structures for
realizing devices, circuits, and heat management directly in 3D. Novel 3D
interconnect concepts, including within the silicon layers, enable
significantly improved routing flexibility in all three dimensions and a
high-density 3D design paradigm overall. Intrinsic components for fabric-level
3D heat management are introduced. Extensive bottom-up simulations and
experiments have been presented to validate the key fabric-enabling concepts.
Evaluation results indicate up to 40x density and 10x performance-per-watt
benefits against conventional 16-nm CMOS for the circuits studied; benefits are
also at least an order of magnitude beyond what was shown to be possible with
other 3D directions.
"
664,Routability in 3D IC Design: Monolithic 3D vs. Skybridge 3D CMOS,"  Conventional 2D CMOS technology is reaching fundamental scaling limits, and
interconnect bottleneck is dominating integrated circuit (IC) power and
performance. While 3D IC technologies using Through Silicon Via or Monolithic
Inter-layer Via alleviate some of these challenges, they follow a similar
layout and routing mindset as 2D CMOS. This is insufficient to address routing
requirements in high-density 3D ICs and even causes severe routing congestion
at large-scale designs, limiting their benefits and scalability. Skybridge is a
recently proposed fine-grained 3D IC fabric relying on vertical nanowires that
presents a paradigm shift for scaling, while addressing associated 3D
connectivity and manufacturability challenges. Skybridge's core fabric
components enable a new 3D IC design approach with vertically-composed logic
gates, and provide a greater degree of routing flexibility compared to
conventional 2D and 3D ICs leading to much larger benefits and future
scalability. In this paper, we present a methodology using relevant metrics to
evaluate and quantify the benefits of Skybridge vs. state-of-the-art
transistor-level monolithic 3D IC (T-MI) and 2D in terms of routability and its
impact on large-scale circuits. This is enabled by a new device-to-system
design flow with commercial CAD tools that we developed for large-scale
Skybridge IC designs in 16nm node. Evaluation for standard benchmark circuits
shows that Skybridge yields up to 1.6x lower routing demand against T-MI with
no routing congestion (routing demand to resource ratio < 1) at all metal
layers. This 3D routability in conjunction with compact vertical gate design in
Skybridge translate into benefits of up to 3x lower power and 11x higher
density over 2D CMOS, while TLM-3DIC approach only has up to 22% power saving
and 2x density improvement over 2D CMOS.

665,"Threshold-Dependent Camouflaged Cells to Secure Circuits Against Reverse
  Engineering Attacks","  With current tools and technology, someone who has physical access to a chip
can extract the detailed layout of the integrated circuit (IC). By using
advanced visual imaging techniques, reverse engineering can reveal details that
are meant to be kept secret, such as a secure protocol or novel implementation
that offers a competitive advantage. A promising solution to defend against
reverse engineering attacks is IC camouflaging. In this work, we propose a new
camouflaging technique based on the threshold voltage of the transistors. We
refer to these cells as threshold dependent camouflaged cells. Our work differs
from current commercial solutions in that the latter use look-alike cells, with
the assumption that it is difficult for the reverse engineer to identify the
cell's functionality. Yet, if a structural distinction between cells exists,
then these are still vulnerable, especially as reverse engineers use more
advanced and precise techniques. On the other hand, the proposed threshold
dependent standard cells are structurally identical regardless of the cells'
functionality. Detailed circuit simulations of our proposed threshold dependent
camouflaged cells demonstrate that they can be used to cost-effectively and
robustly camouflage large netlists. Corner analysis of process, temperature,
and supply voltage (PVT) variations show that our cells operate as expected
over all PVT corners simulated.
"
666,VLSI Extreme Learning Machine: A Design Space Exploration,"  In this paper, we describe a compact low-power, high performance hardware
implementation of the extreme learning machine (ELM) for machine learning
applications. Mismatch in current mirrors are used to perform the vector-matrix
multiplication that forms the first stage of this classifier and is the most
computationally intensive. Both regression and classification (on UCI data
sets) are demonstrated and a design space trade-off between speed, power and
accuracy is explored. Our results indicate that for a wide set of problems,
$\sigma V_T$ in the range of $15-25$mV gives optimal results. An input weight
matrix rotation method to extend the input dimension and hidden layer size
beyond the physical limits imposed by the chip is also described. This allows
us to overcome a major limit imposed on most hardware machine learners. The
chip is implemented in a $0.35 \mu$m CMOS process and occupies a die area of
around 5 mm $\times$ 5 mm. Operating from a $1$ V power supply, it achieves an
energy efficiency of $0.47$ pJ/MAC at a classification rate of $31.6$ kHz.

667,"Unconditionally secure credit/debit card chip scheme and physical
  unclonable function","  The statistical-physics-based Kirchhoff-law-Johnson-noise (KLJN) key exchange
offers a new and simple unclonable system for credit/debit card chip
authentication and payment. The key exchange, the authentication and the
communication are unconditionally secure so that neither mathematics- nor
statistics-based attacks are able to crack the scheme. The ohmic connection and
the short wiring lengths between the chips in the card and the terminal
constitute an ideal setting for the KLJN protocol, and even its simplest
versions offer unprecedented security and privacy for credit/debit card chips
and applications of physical unclonable functions.
"
668,"Factoring with Qutrits: Shor's Algorithm on Ternary and Metaplectic
  Quantum Architectures","  We determine the cost of performing Shor's algorithm for integer
factorization on a ternary quantum computer, using two natural models of
universal fault-tolerant computing:
  (i) a model based on magic state distillation that assumes the availability
of the ternary Clifford gates, projective measurements, classical control as
its natural instrumentation set; (ii) a model based on a metaplectic
topological quantum computer (MTQC). A natural choice to implement Shor's
algorithm on a ternary quantum computer is to translate the entire arithmetic
into a ternary form. However, it is also possible to emulate the standard
binary version of the algorithm by encoding each qubit in a three-level system.
We compare the two approaches and analyze the complexity of implementing Shor's
period finding function in the two models. We also highlight the fact that the
cost of achieving universality through magic states in MTQC architecture is
asymptotically lower than in generic ternary case.
"
669,"Probabilistic Deep Spiking Neural Systems Enabled by Magnetic Tunnel
  Junction","  Deep Spiking Neural Networks are becoming increasingly powerful tools for
cognitive computing platforms. However, most of the existing literature on such
computing models are developed with limited insights on the underlying hardware
implementation, resulting in area and power expensive designs. Although several
neuromimetic devices emulating neural operations have been proposed recently,
their functionality has been limited to very simple neural models that may
prove to be inefficient at complex recognition tasks. In this work, we venture
into the relatively unexplored area of utilizing the inherent device
stochasticity of such neuromimetic devices to model complex neural
functionalities in a probabilistic framework in the time domain. We consider
the implementation of a Deep Spiking Neural Network capable of performing high
accuracy and low latency classification tasks where the neural computing unit
is enabled by the stochastic switching behavior of a Magnetic Tunnel Junction.
Simulation studies indicate an energy improvement of $20\times$ over a baseline
CMOS design in $45nm$ technology.
"
670,Well-Posed Models of Memristive Devices,"  Existing compact models for memristive devices (including RRAM and CBRAM) all
suffer from issues related to mathematical ill-posedness and/or improper
implementation. This limits their value for simulation and design and in some
cases, results in qualitatively unphysical predictions. We identify the causes
of ill-posedness in these models. We then show how memristive devices in
general can be modelled using only continuous/smooth primitives in such a way
that they always respect physical bounds for filament length and also feature
well-defined and correct DC behaviour. We show how to express these models
properly in languages like Verilog-A and ModSpec (MATLAB). We apply these
methods to correct previously published RRAM and memristor models and make them
well posed. The result is a collection of memristor models that may be dubbed
""simulation-ready"", i.e., that feature the right physical characteristics and
are suitable for robust and consistent simulation in DC, AC, transient, etc.,
analyses. We provide implementations of these models in both ModSpec/MATLAB and
Verilog-A.
"
671,Memristor model based on fuzzy window function,"  Memristor (memory-resistor) is the fourth passive circuit element. We
introduce a memristor model based on a fuzzy logic window function. Fuzzy
models are flexible, which enables the capture of the pinched hysteresis
behavior of the memristor. The introduced fuzzy model avoids common problems
associated with window-function based memristor models, such as the terminal
state problem, and the symmetry issues. The model captures the memristor
behavior with a simple rule-base which gives an insight of how memristors work.
Because of the flexibility offered by the fuzzy system, shape and distribution
of input and output membership functions can be tuned to capture the behavior
of various real memristors.
"
672,Ancilla-free Reversible Logic Synthesis via Sorting,"  Reversible logic synthesis is emerging as a major research component for
post-CMOS computing devices, in particular Quantum computing. In this work, we
link the reversible logic synthesis problem to sorting algorithms. Based on our
analysis, an alternative derivation of the worst-case complexity of generated
reversible circuits is provided. Furthermore, a novel column-wise reversible
logic synthesis method, termed RevCol, is designed with inspiration from radix
sort. Extending the principles of RevCol, we present a hybrid reversible logic
synthesis framework. The theoretical and experimental results are presented.
The results are extensively benchmarked with state-of-the-art ancilla-free
reversible logic synthesis methods.
"
673,Optimizing Teleportation Cost in Distributed Quantum Circuits,"  The presented work provides a procedure for optimizing the communication cost
of a distributed quantum circuit (DQC) in terms of the number of qubit
teleportations. Because of technology limitations which do not allow large
quantum computers to work as a single processing element, distributed quantum
computation is an appropriate solution to overcome this difficulty. Previous
studies have applied ad-hoc solutions to distribute a quantum system for
special cases and applications. In this study, a general approach is proposed
to optimize the number of teleportations for a DQC consisting of two spatially
separated and long-distance quantum subsystems. To this end, different
configurations of locations for executing gates whose qubits are in distinct
subsystems are considered and for each of these configurations, the proposed
algorithm is run to find the minimum number of required teleportations.
Finally, the configuration which leads to the minimum number of teleportations
is reported. The proposed method can be used as an automated procedure to find
the configuration with the optimal communication cost for the DQC.
"
674,"A Subgradient Approach for Constrained Binary Optimization via Quantum
  Adiabatic Evolution","  An earlier work [18] proposes a method for solving the Lagrangian dual of a
constrained binary quadratic programming problem via quantum adiabatic
evolution using an outer approximation method. This should be an efficient
prescription for solving the Lagrangian dual problem in the presence of an
ideally noise-free quantum adiabatic system. However, current implementations
of quantum annealing systems demand methods that are efficient at handling
possible sources of noise. In this paper, we consider a subgradient method for
finding an optimal primal-dual pair for the Lagrangian dual of a constrained
binary polynomial programming problem. We then study the quadratic stable set
(QSS) problem as a case study. We see that this method applied to the QSS
problem can be viewed as an instance-dependent penalty-term approach that
avoids large penalty coefficients. Finally, we report our experimental results
of using the D-Wave 2X quantum annealer and conclude that our approach helps
this quantum processor to succeed more often in solving these problems compared
to the usual penalty-term approaches.
"
675,SMIET: Simultaneous Molecular Information and Energy Transfer,"  The performance of communication systems is fundamentally limited by the loss
of energy through propagation and circuit inefficiencies. In this article, we
show that it is possible to achieve ultra low energy communications at the
nano-scale, if diffusive molecules are used for carrying data. Whilst the
energy of electromagnetic waves will inevitably decay as a function of
transmission distance and time, the energy in individual molecules does not.
Over time, the receiver has an opportunity to recover some, if not all of the
molecular energy transmitted. The article demonstrates the potential of
ultra-low energy simultaneous molecular information and energy transfer (SMIET)
through the design of two different nano-relay systems, and the discusses how
molecular communications can benefit more from crowd energy harvesting than
traditional wave-based systems.
"
676,"A multi-objective synthesis methodology for majority/minority logic
  networks","  New technologies such as Quantum-dot Cellular Automata (QCA), Single Electron
Tunneling (SET), Tunneling Phase Logic (TPL) and all-spin logic (ASL) devices
have been widely advocated in nanotechnology as a response to the physical
limits associated with complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS)
technology in atomic scales. Some of their peculiar features are their smaller
size, higher speed, higher switching frequency, lower power consumption, and
higher scale integration. In these technologies, the majority (or minority) and
inverter gates are employed for the production of the functions as this set of
gates makes a universal set of Boolean primitives in these technologies. An
important step in the generation of Boolean functions using the majority gate
is reducing the number of involved gates. In this paper, a multi-objective
synthesis methodology (with the objective priority of gate counts, gate levels
and the number of inverter gates) is presented for finding the minimal number
of possible majority gates in the synthesis of Boolean functions using the
proposed Majority Specification Matrix (MSM) concept. Moreover, based on MSM, a
synthesis flow is proposed for the synthesis of multi-output Boolean functions.
To reveal the efficiency of the proposed method, it is compared with a
meta-heuristic method, multi-objective Genetic Programing (GP). Besides, it is
applied to synthesize MCNC benchmark circuits. The results are indicative of
the outperformance of the proposed method in comparison to multi-objective GP
method. Also, for the MCNC benchmark circuits, there is an average reduction of
10.5% in the number of levels as well as 16.8% and 33.5% in the number of
majority and inverter gates, as compared to the best available method
respectively.
"
677,"Attack resilient architecture to replace embedded Flash with STTRAM in
  homogeneous IoTs","  Spin-Transfer Torque RAM (STTRAM) is an emerging Non-Volatile Memory (NVM)
technology that provides better endurance, write energy and performance than
traditional NVM technologies such as Flash. In embedded application such as
microcontroller SoC of Internet of Things (IoT), embedded Flash (eFlash) is
widely employed. However, eFlash is also associated with cost. Therefore,
replacing eFlash with STTRAM is desirable in IoTs for power-efficiency.
Although promising, STTRAM brings several new security and privacy challenges
that pose a significant threat to sensitive data in memory. This is inevitable
due to the underlying dependency of this memory technology on environmental
parameters such as temperature and magnetic fields that can be exploited by an
adversary to tamper with the program and data. In this paper, we investigate
these attacks and propose a novel memory architecture for attack resilient IoT
network. The information redundancy present in a homogeneous peer-to-peer
connected IoT network is exploited to restore the corrupted memory of any IoT
node when under attack. We are able to build a failsafe IoT system with STTRAM
based program memory which allows guaranteed execution of all the IoT nodes
without complete shutdown of any node under attack. Experimental results using
commercial IoT boards demonstrate the latency and energy overhead of the attack
recovery process.
"
678,Multi-Bit Read and Write Methodologies for Diode-STTRAM Crossbar Array,"  Crossbar arrays using emerging non-volatile memory technologies such as
Resistive RAM (ReRAM) offer high density, fast access speed and low-power.
However the bandwidth of the crossbar is limited to single-bit read/write per
access to avoid selection of undesirable bits. We propose a technique to
perform multi-bit read and write in a diode-STTRAM (Spin Transfer Torque RAM)
crossbar array. Simulation shows that the biasing voltage of half-selected
cells can be adjusted to improve the sense margin during read and thus reduce
the sneak path through the half-selected cells. In write operation, the
half-selected cells are biased with a pulse voltage source which increases the
write latency of these cells and enables to write 2-bits while keeping the
half-selected bits undisturbed. Simulation results indicate biasing the
half-selected cells by 700mV can enable reading as much as 512-bits while
sustaining 512x512 crossbar with 2.04 years retention. The 2-bit writing
requires pulsing by 50mV to optimize energy.
"
679,Some Results on Reversible Gate Classes Over Non-Binary Alphabets,"  We present a collection of results concerning the structure of reversible
gate classes over non-binary alphabets, including (1) a reversible gate class
over non-binary alphabets that is not finitely generated (2) an explicit set of
generators for the class of all gates, the class of all conservative gates, and
a class of generalizations of the two (3) an embedding of the poset of
reversible gate classes over an alphabet of size $k$ into that of an alphabet
of size $k+1$ (4) a classification of gate classes containing the class of
$(k-1,1)$-conservative gates, meaning gates that preserve the number of
occurrences of a certain element in the alphabet.
"
680,Hierarchical Self-Assembly of Fractals with Signal-Passing Tiles,"  In this paper, we present high-level overviews of tile-based self-assembling
systems capable of producing complex, infinite, aperiodic structures known as
discrete self-similar fractals. Fractals have a variety of interesting
mathematical and structural properties, and by utilizing the bottom-up growth
paradigm of self-assembly to create them we not only learn important techniques
for building such complex structures, we also gain insight into how similar
structural complexity arises in natural self-assembling systems. Our results
fundamentally leverage hierarchical assembly processes, and use as our building
blocks square ""tile"" components which are capable of activating and
deactivating their binding ""glues"" a constant number of times each, based only
on local interactions. We provide the first constructions capable of building
arbitrary discrete self-similar fractals at scale factor 1, and many at
temperature 1 (i.e. ""non-cooperatively""), including the Sierpinski triangle.
"
681,"Atomic scale nanoelectronics for quantum neuromorphic devices: comparing
  different materials","  I review the advancements of atomic scale nanoelectronics towards quantum
neuromorphics. First, I summarize the key properties of elementary combinations
of few neurons, namely long-- and short--term plasticity, spike-timing
dependent plasticity (associative plasticity), quantumness and stochastic
effects, and their potential computational employment. Next, I review several
atomic scale device technologies developed to control electron transport at the
atomic level, including single atom implantation for atomic arrays and CMOS
quantum dots, single atom memories, Ag$_2$S and Cu$_2$S atomic switches,
hafnium based RRAMs, organic material based transistors, Ge$_2$Sb$_2$Te$_5$
synapses. Each material/method proved successful in achieving some of the
properties observed in real neurons. I compare the different methods towards
the creation of a new generation of naturally inspired and biophysically
meaningful artificial neurons, in order to replace the rigid CMOS based
neuromorphic hardware. The most challenging aspect to address appears to obtain
both the stochastic/quantum behavior and the associative plasticity, which are
currently observed only below and above 20 nm length scale respectively, by
employing the same material.
"
682,On the Runtime of Universal Coating for Programmable Matter,"  Imagine coating buildings and bridges with smart particles (also coined smart
paint) that monitor structural integrity and sense and report on traffic and
wind loads, leading to technology that could do such inspection jobs faster and
cheaper and increase safety at the same time. In this paper, we study the
problem of uniformly coating objects of arbitrary shape in the context of
self-organizing programmable matter, i.e., programmable matter which consists
of simple computational elements called particles that can establish and
release bonds and can actively move in a self-organized way. Particles are
anonymous, have constant-size memory, and utilize only local interactions in
order to coat an object. We continue the study of our Universal Coating
algorithm by focusing on its runtime analysis, showing that our algorithm
terminates within a linear number of rounds with high probability. We also
present a matching linear lower bound that holds with high probability. We use
this lower bound to show a linear lower bound on the competitive gap between
fully local coating algorithms and coating algorithms that rely on global
information, which implies that our algorithm is also optimal in a competitive
sense. Simulation results show that the competitive ratio of our algorithm may
be better than linear in practice.
"
683,A revised model of fluid transport optimization in Physarum polycephalum,"  Optimization of fluid transport in the slime mold Physarum polycephalum has
been the subject of several modeling efforts in recent literature. Existing
models assume that the tube adaptation mechanism in P. polycephalum's tubular
network is controlled by the sheer amount of fluid flow through the tubes. We
put forward the hypothesis that the controlling variable may instead be the
flow's pressure gradient along the tube. We carry out the stability analysis of
such a revised mathematical model for a parallel-edge network, proving that the
revised model supports the global flow-optimizing behavior of the slime mold
for a substantially wider class of response functions compared to previous
models. Simulations also suggest that the same conclusion may be valid for
arbitrary network topologies.
"
684,"SocialHBC: Social Networking and Secure Authentication using
  Interference-Robust Human Body Communication","  With the advent of cheap computing through five decades of continued
miniaturization following Moores Law, wearable devices are becoming
increasingly popular. These wearable devices are typically interconnected using
wireless body area network (WBAN). Human body communication (HBC) provides an
alternate energy-efficient communication technique between on-body wearable
devices by using the human body as a conducting medium. This allows order of
magnitude lower communication power, compared to WBAN, due to lower loss and
broadband signaling. Moreover, HBC is significantly more secure than WBAN, as
the information is contained within the human body and cannot be snooped on
unless the person is physically touched. In this paper, we highlight
applications of HBC as (1) Social Networking (e.g. LinkedIn/Facebook friend
request sent during Handshaking in a meeting/party), (2) Secure Authentication
using human-human or human-machine dynamic HBC and (3) ultra-low power, secure
BAN using intra-human HBC. One of the biggest technical bottlenecks of HBC has
been the interference (e.g. FM) picked up by the human body acting like an
antenna. In this work, for the first time, we introduce an integrating dual
data rate (DDR) receiver technique, that allows notch filtering (>20 dB) of the
interference for interference-robust HBC.
"
685,Inscribed Matter Communication: Part I,"  We provide a fundamental treatment of the molecular communication channel
wherein ""inscribed matter"" is transmitted across a spatial gap to provide
reliable signaling between a sender and receiver. Inscribed matter is defined
as an ensemble of ""tokens"" (molecules, objects, and so on) and is inspired, at
least partially, by biological systems where groups of individually constructed
discrete particles ranging from molecules through membrane-bound structures
containing molecules to viruses and organisms are released by a source and
travel to a target -- for example, morphogens or semiochemicals diffuse from
one cell, tissue or organism diffuse to another. For identical tokens that are
neither lost nor modified, we consider messages encoded using three candidate
communication schemes: a) token timing (timed release), b) token payload
(composition), and c) token timing plus payload. We provide capacity bounds for
each scheme and discuss their relative utility. We find that under not
unreasonable assumptions, megabit per second rates could be supported at
femtoWatt transmitter powers. Since quantities such as token concentration or
bin-counting are derivatives of token arrival timing, individual token timing
undergirds all molecular communication techniques. Thus, our modeling and
results about the physics of efficient token-based information transfer can
inform investigations of diverse theoretical and practical problems in
engineering and biology. This work, Part I, focuses on the information
theoretic bounds on capacity. Part II develops some of the mathematical and
information-theoretic ideas that support the bounds presented here.
"
686,Inscribed Matter Communication: Part II,"  This paper is Part II of a two-paper set which develops a finest-grain
per-molecule timing treatment of molecular communication. We first consider a
simple one-molecule timing channel with a molecule launch deadline, similar to
but different from previous work (""Bits Through Queues"") where the constraint
was mean launch time. We also derive a number of results related to the {\em
ordering entropy}, a key quantity which undergirds the capacity bounds for the
molecular timing channel, both with and without token data payloads. We then
conclude with an upper bound on molecular timing-channel capacity.
"
687,"Image Edge Detection based on Swarm Intelligence using Memristive
  Networks","  Recent advancements in the development of memristive devices has opened new
opportunities for hardware implementation of non-Boolean computing. To this
end, the suitability of memristive devices for swarm intelligence algorithms
has enabled researchers to solve a maze in hardware. In this paper, we utilize
swarm intelligence of memristive networks to perform image edge detection.
First, we propose a hardware-friendly algorithm for image edge detection based
on ant colony. Second, we implement the image edge detection algorithm using
memristive networks. Furthermore, we explain the impact of various parameters
of the memristors on the efficacy of the implementation. Our results show 28%
improvement in the energy compared to a low power CMOS hardware implementation
based on stochastic circuits. Furthermore, our design occupies up to 5x less
area.
"
688,Stochastic Characteristics of Qubits and Qubit chains on the D-Wave 2X,"  This document presents a studies of the stochastic behavior of D-Wave qubits,
qubit cells, and qubit chains. The purpose of this paper is to address the
algorithmic behavior of execution rather than the physical behavior, though
they are related. The measurements from an actual D-Wave adiabatic quantum
computer are compare with calculated measurements from a theoretical adiabatic
quantum computer running with an effective temperature of zero. In this way the
paper attempts to shed light on how the D-Wave's behavior effects how well it
minimizes its objective function and why the D-Wave performs as it does.
"
689,Digital Calibration Method for High Resolution in Analog/RF Designs,"  Transistor random mismatch continuously poses challenges for analog/RF
circuit design for achieving high accuracy and high yield as the process
technology advances. Existing statistical element selection (SES) design method
can improve transistor matching property, but it falls short of being a general
calibration method due to its limited calibration range. In this dissertation,
we propose a high resolution digital calibration method, called extended
statistical element selection (ESES). As compared to the SES method, the ESES
method not only provides wider calibration range, but also it results in higher
calibration yield with same calibration resolution target. Two types of ESES
based calibration application in analog/RF circuits are also proposed. One is
current source calibration and the other is phase/delay calibration. To verify
this proposed digital calibration method in circuit implementation, we
designed, fabricated and tested a wideband harmonic rejection receiver design.
The receiver utilizes ESES-based gain and phase error calibration for improving
harmonic rejection ratios. With the high calibration resolution provided by the
ESES method, after calibration, we achieved best-in-class harmonic rejection
ratios. To extend the application of the proposed method, we further designed a
current-steering D/A data converter (CS-DAC). The CS-DAC utilizes ESES-based
amplitude and timing error calibration for improving linearity performance.
Simulation results showed that we can achieve more than one order of magnitude
linearity improvement after performing ESES-based calibration in the CS-DAC.
"
690,"Embodied Approximation of the Density Classification Problem via
  Morphological Adaptation","  The Majority (or Density Classification) Problem in Cellular Automata (CA)
aims to converge a string of cells to a final homogeneous state which reflects
the majority of states present in the initial configuration. The problem is
challenging in CA as individual cells only possess information about their own
and local neighbour states. The problem is an exercise in the propagation and
processing of information within a distributed computational medium. We explore
whether the Majority Problem can be approximated in a similarly simple
distributed computing substrate - a multi-agent model of slime mould. An
initial pattern of discrete voting choices is represented by spatial
arrangement of the agent population, temporarily held in-place by an attractant
stimulus. When this stimulus is removed the model adapts its shape and size,
moving to form a minimal distance connecting line. The final position of this
line is shown, in simple examples, to successfully represent the majority vote
decision, and also accurately reflects the size of the majority. We note
properties, limitations and potential improvements to the approach before
returning full-circle by re-encoding this morphological adaptation approach in
a simple (and more space efficient) 1D CA model.
"
691,A Boltzmann Machine Implementation for the D-Wave,"  The D-Wave is an adiabatic quantum computer. It is an understatement to say
that it is not a traditional computer. It can be viewed as a computational
accelerator or more precisely a computational oracle, where one asks it a
relevant question and it returns a useful answer. The question is how do you
ask a relevant question and how do you use the answer it returns. This paper
addresses these issues in a way that is pertinent to machine learning. A
Boltzmann machine is implemented with the D-Wave since the D-Wave is merely a
hardware instantiation of a partially connected Boltzmann machine. This paper
presents a prototype implementation of a 3-layered neural network where the
D-Wave is used as the middle (hidden) layer of the neural network. This paper
also explains how the D-Wave can be utilized in a multi-layer neural network
(more than 3 layers) and one in which each layer may be multiple times the size
of the D-Wave being used.

692,Proceedings of the 7th International Workshop on Physics and Computation,"  This volume constitutes the proceedings of the 7th International Workshop on
Physics and Computation (PC 2016). The workshop was held on the 14th of July
2016 in Manchester, UK, as a satellite workshop to UCNC 2016, the 15th
International Conference on Unconventional Computation and Natural Computation.
  The goal of the workshop series is to bring together researches working on
the interaction between physics and the theory of computation. This
intrinsically interdisciplinary domain of research strives to go beyond the
traditional use of mathematics as a tool to model and understand the behaviour
of physical systems. Instead, it looks to the the theory of computation and
information to provide new insights into physical systems and processes, and,
in turn, how these insights can lead to new methods, models and notation of
computation and new approaches to computational and mathematical problems.
Topics falling into this category at the interface of physics and computation
that are within the scope of the conference include, amongst many others, the
axiomatisation of physics, hypercomputation, the role of information in
physical systems, quantum information, randomness in physics, theories of
measurement, and the philosophy of physics and computation.
"
693,"An Overview of Approaches to Modernize Quantum Annealing Using Local
  Searches","  I describe how real quantum annealers may be used to perform local (in state
space) searches around specified states, rather than the global searches
traditionally implemented in the quantum annealing algorithm. The quantum
annealing algorithm is an analogue of simulated annealing, a classical
numerical technique which is now obsolete. Hence, I explore strategies to use
an annealer in a way which takes advantage of modern classical optimization
algorithms, and additionally should be less sensitive to problem
mis-specification then the traditional quantum annealing algorithm.
"
694,"Device and Circuit Interaction Analysis of Stochastic Behaviors in
  Cross-Point RRAM Arrays","  Stochastic behaviors of resistive random access memory (RRAM) play an
important role in the design of cross-point memory arrays. A Monte Carlo
compact model of oxide RRAM is developed and calibrated with experiments on
various device stack configurations. With Monte Carlo SPICE simulations, we
show that an increase in array size and interconnect wire resistance will
statistically deteriorate write functionality. Write failure probability (WFP)
has an exponential dependency on device uniformity and supply voltage (VDD),
and the array bias scheme is a key knob. Lowering array VDD leads to higher
effective energy consumption (EEC) due to the increase in WFP when the
variation statistics are included in the analysis. Random-access simulations
indicate that data sparsity statistically benefits write functionality and
energy consumption. Finally, we show that a pseudo-sub-array topology with
uniformly distributed pre-forming cells in the pristine high resistance state
is able to reduce both WFP and EEC, enabling higher net capacity for memory
circuits due to improved variation tolerance.
"
695,Efficient Analog Circuits for Boolean Satisfiability,"  Efficient solutions to NP-complete problems would significantly benefit both
science and industry. However, such problems are intractable on digital
computers based on the von Neumann architecture, thus creating the need for
alternative solutions to tackle such problems. Recently, a deterministic,
continuous-time dynamical system (CTDS) was proposed (Nat.Phys. {\bf 7}(12),
966 (2011)) to solve a representative NP-complete problem, Boolean
Satisfiability (SAT). This solver shows polynomial analog time-complexity on
even the hardest benchmark $k$-SAT ($k \geq 3$) formulas, but at an energy cost
through exponentially driven auxiliary variables. This paper presents a novel
analog hardware SAT solver, AC-SAT, implementing the CTDS via incorporating
novel, analog circuit design ideas. AC-SAT is intended to be used as a
co-processor and is programmable for handling different problem specifications.
It is especially effective for solving hard $k$-SAT problem instances that are
challenging for algorithms running on digital machines. Furthermore, with its
modular design, AC-SAT can readily be extended to solve larger size problems,
while the size of the circuit grows linearly with the product of the number of
variables and number of clauses. The circuit is designed and simulated based on
a 32nm CMOS technology. SPICE simulation results show speedup factors of
$\sim$10$^4$ on even the hardest 3-SAT problems, when compared with a
state-of-the-art SAT solver on digital computers. As an example, for hard
problems with $N=50$ variables and $M=212$ clauses, solutions are found within
from a few $ns$ to a few hundred $ns$.
"
696,A Testbed for Transiently Powered Computers,"  Transiently Powered Computers (TPCs) are novel devices that are battery-less
and operate using only ambient energy. Therefore TPCs are prone to frequent
power interruptions, and such the need for developing TPC-centric algorithms is
a necessity. We advocate that only through a common experimental environment,
accessible to everyone, a proper comparison of newly developed algorithms for
TPCs can be realized. Moreover, only through access to various TPC
testbeds---distributed geographically throughout the world---a proper
applications testing and validation are possible. We enlist properties and
features that any TPC testbed should have, calling for more coordinated action
in this domain of TPC research. Finally, we present (to the best of our
knowledge) world's first Internet-accessible testbed for TPCs.
"
697,Spintronic nano-devices for bio-inspired computing,"  Bio-inspired hardware holds the promise of low-energy, intelligent and highly
adaptable computing systems. Applications span from automatic classification
for big data management, through unmanned vehicle control, to control for
bio-medical prosthesis. However, one of the major challenges of fabricating
bio-inspired hardware is building ultra-high density networks out of complex
processing units interlinked by tunable connections. Nanometer-scale devices
exploiting spin electronics (or spintronics) can be a key technology in this
context. In particular, magnetic tunnel junctions are well suited for this
purpose because of their multiple tunable functionalities. One such
functionality, non-volatile memory, can provide massive embedded memory in
unconventional circuits, thus escaping the von-Neumann bottleneck arising when
memory and processors are located separately. Other features of spintronic
devices that could be beneficial for bio-inspired computing include tunable
fast non-linear dynamics, controlled stochasticity, and the ability of single
devices to change functions in different operating conditions. Large networks
of interacting spintronic nano-devices can have their interactions tuned to
induce complex dynamics such as synchronization, chaos, soliton diffusion,
phase transitions, criticality, and convergence to multiple metastable states.
A number of groups have recently proposed bio-inspired architectures that
include one or several types of spintronic nanodevices. In this article we show
how spintronics can be used for bio-inspired computing. We review the different
approaches that have been proposed, the recent advances in this direction, and
the challenges towards fully integrated spintronics-CMOS (Complementary metal -
oxide - semiconductor) bio-inspired hardware.
"
698,"Comprehensive Reactive Receiver Modeling for Diffusive Molecular
  Communication Systems: Reversible Binding, Molecule Degradation, and Finite
  Number of Receptors","  This paper studies the problem of receiver modeling in molecular
communication systems. We consider the diffusive molecular communication
channel between a transmitter nano-machine and a receiver nano-machine in a
fluid environment. The information molecules released by the transmitter
nano-machine into the environment can degrade in the channel via a first-order
degradation reaction and those that reach the receiver nano-machine can
participate in a reversible bimolecular reaction with receiver receptor
proteins. Thereby, we distinguish between two scenarios. In the first scenario,
we assume that the entire surface of the receiver is covered by receptor
molecules. We derive a closed-form analytical expression for the expected
received signal at the receiver, i.e., the expected number of activated
receptors on the surface of the receiver. Then, in the second scenario, we
consider the case where the number of receptor molecules is finite and the
uniformly distributed receptor molecules cover the receiver surface only
partially. We show that the expected received signal for this scenario can be
accurately approximated by the expected received signal for the first scenario
after appropriately modifying the forward reaction rate constant. The accuracy
of the derived analytical results is verified by Brownian motion particle-based
simulations of the considered environment, where we also show the impact of the
effect of receptor occupancy on the derived analytical results.

699,ISI-Aware Modeling and Achievable Rate Analysis of the Diffusion Channel,"  Analyzing the achievable rate of molecular communication via diffusion (MCvD)
inherits intricacies due to its nature: MCvD channel has memory, and the heavy
tail of the signal causes inter symbol interference (ISI). Therefore, using
Shannon's channel capacity formulation for memoryless channel is not
appropriate for the MCvD channel. Instead, a more general achievable rate
formulation and system model must be considered to make this analysis
accurately. In this letter, we propose an effective ISI-aware MCvD modeling
technique in 3-D medium and properly analyze the achievable rate.

700,"Review on Physically Flexible Nonvolatile Memory for Internet of
  Everything Electronics","  Solid-state memory is an essential component of the digital age. With
advancements in healthcare technology and the Internet of Things (IoT), the
demand for ultra-dense, ultra-low-power memory is increasing. In this review,
we present a comprehensive perspective on the most notable approaches to the
fabrication of physically flexible memory devices. With the future goal of
replacing traditional mechanical hard disks with solid-state storage devices, a
fully flexible electronic system will need two basic devices: transistors and
nonvolatile memory. Transistors are used for logic operations and gating memory
arrays, while nonvolatile memory (NVM) devices are required for storing
information in the main memory and cache storage. Since the highest density of
transistors and storage structures is manifested in memories, the focus of this
review is flexible NVM. Flexible NVM components are discussed in terms of their
functionality, performance metrics, and reliability aspects, all of which are
critical components for NVM technology to be part of mainstream consumer
electronics, IoT, and advanced healthcare devices. Finally, flexible NVMs are
benchmarked and future prospects are provided.

701,"Comments on ""sub-KBT micro-electromechanical irreversible logic gate""","  In a recent article, Nature Communications 7 (2016) 12068, the authors
claimed that they demonstrated sub-kBT energy dissipation at elementary logic
operations. However, the argumentation is invalid because it neglects the
dominant source of energy dissipation, namely, the charging energy of the
capacitance of the input electrode, which totally dissipates during the full
(0-1-0) cycle of logic values. The neglected dissipation phenomenon is
identical with the mechanism that leads to the lower physical limit of
dissipation (70-100 kBT) in today's microprocessors (CMOS logic) and in any
other system with thermally activated errors thus the same limit holds for the
new scheme, too.

702,The Art of DNA Strings: Sixteen Years of DNA Coding Theory,"  The idea of computing with DNA was given by Tom Head in 1987, however in 1994
in a seminal paper, the actual successful experiment for DNA computing was
performed by Adleman. The heart of the DNA computing is the DNA hybridization,
however, it is also the source of errors. Thus the success of the DNA computing
depends on the error control techniques. The classical coding theory techniques
have provided foundation for the current information and communication
technology (ICT). Thus it is natural to expect that coding theory will be the
foundational subject for the DNA computing paradigm. For the successful
experiments with DNA computing usually we design DNA strings which are
sufficiently dissimilar. This leads to the construction of a large set of DNA
strings which satisfy certain combinatorial and thermodynamic constraints. Over
the last 16 years, many approaches such as combinatorial, algebraic,
computational have been used to construct such DNA strings. In this work, we
survey this interesting area of DNA coding theory by providing key ideas of the
area and current known results.
"
703,"Reducing the Energy Cost of Inference via In-sensor Information
  Processing","  There is much interest in incorporating inference capabilities into
sensor-rich embedded platforms such as autonomous vehicles, wearables, and
others. A central problem in the design of such systems is the need to extract
information locally from sensed data on a severely limited energy budget. This
necessitates the design of energy-efficient sensory embedded system. A typical
sensory embedded system enforces a physical separation between sensing and
computational subsystems - a separation mandated by the differing requirements
of the sensing and computational functions. As a consequence, the energy
consumption in such systems tends to be dominated by the energy consumed in
transferring data over the sensor-processor interface (communication energy)
and the energy consumed in processing the data in digital processor
(computational energy). In this article, we propose an in-sensor computing
architecture which (mostly) eliminates the sensor-processor interface by
embedding inference computations in the noisy sensor fabric in analog and
retraining the hyperparameters in order to compensate for non-ideal
computations. The resulting architecture referred to as the Compute Sensor - a
sensor that computes in addition to sensing - represents a radical departure
from the conventional. We show that a Compute Sensor for image data can be
designed by embedding both feature extraction and classification functions in
the analog domain in close proximity to the CMOS active pixel sensor (APS)
array. Significant gains in energy-efficiency are demonstrated using behavioral
and energy models in a commercial semiconductor process technology. In the
process, the Compute Sensor creates a unique opportunity to develop machine
learning algorithms for information extraction from data on a noisy underlying
computational fabric.
"
704,Dependence of dissipation on the initial distribution over states,"  We analyze how the amount of work dissipated by a fixed nonequilibrium
process depends on the initial distribution over states. Specifically, we
compare the amount of dissipation when the process is used with some specified
initial distribution to the minimal amount of dissipation possible for any
initial distribution. We show that the difference between those two amounts of
dissipation is given by a simple information-theoretic function that depends
only on the initial and final state distributions. Crucially, this difference
is independent of the details of the process relating those distributions. We
then consider how dissipation depends on the initial distribution for a
'computer', i.e., a nonequilibrium process whose dynamics over coarse-grained
macrostates implement some desired input-output map. We show that our results
still apply when stated in terms of distributions over the computer's
coarse-grained macrostates. This can be viewed as a novel thermodynamic cost of
computation, reflecting changes in the distribution over inputs rather than the
logical dynamics of the computation.
"
705,Performance Models for Split-execution Computing Systems,"  Split-execution computing leverages the capabilities of multiple
computational models to solve problems, but splitting program execution across
different computational models incurs costs associated with the translation
between domains. We analyze the performance of a split-execution computing
system developed from conventional and quantum processing units (QPUs) by using
behavioral models that track resource usage. We focus on asymmetric processing
models built using conventional CPUs and a family of special-purpose QPUs that
employ quantum computing principles. Our performance models account for the
translation of a classical optimization problem into the physical
representation required by the quantum processor while also accounting for
hardware limitations and conventional processor speed and memory. We conclude
that the bottleneck in this split-execution computing system lies at the
quantum-classical interface and that the primary time cost is independent of
quantum processor behavior.
"
706,"Synchronization Detection in Networks of Coupled Oscillators for Pattern
  Recognition","  Coupled oscillator-based networks are an attractive approach for implementing
hardware neural networks based on emerging nanotechnologies. However, the
readout of the state of a coupled oscillator network is a difficult challenge
in hardware implementations, as it necessitates complex signal processing to
evaluate the degree of synchronization between oscillators, possibly more
complicated than the coupled oscillator network itself. In this work, we focus
on a coupled oscillator network particularly adapted to emerging technologies,
and evaluate two schemes for reading synchronization patterns that can be
readily implemented with basic CMOS circuits. Through simulation of a simple
generic coupled oscillator network, we compare the operation of these readout
techniques with a previously proposed full statistics evaluation scheme. Our
approaches provide results nearly identical to the mathematical method, but
also show better resilience to moderate noise, which is a major concern for
hardware implementations. These results open the door to widespread realization
of hardware coupled oscillator-based neural systems.
"
707,Discovering Boolean Gates in Slime Mould,"  Slime mould of Physarum polycephalum is a large cell exhibiting rich spatial
non-linear electrical characteristics. We exploit the electrical properties of
the slime mould to implement logic gates using a flexible hardware platform
designed for investigating the electrical properties of a substrate (MECOBO).
We apply arbitrary electrical signals to `configure' the slime mould, i.e.
change shape of its body and, measure the slime mould's electrical response. We
show that it is possible to find configurations that allow the Physarum to act
as any 2-input Boolean gate. The occurrence frequency of the gates discovered
in the slime was analysed and compared to complexity hierarchies of logical
gates obtained in other unconventional materials. The search for gates was
performed by both sweeping across configurations in the real material as well
as training a neural network-based model and searching the gates therein using
gradient descent.

708,"DNA Image Pro -- A Tool for Generating Pixel Patterns using DNA Tile
  Assembly","  Self-assembly is a process found everywhere in the Nature. In particular, it
is known that DNA self-assembly is Turing universal. Thus one can do arbitrary
computations or build nano-structures using DNA self-assembly. In order to
understand the DNA self-assembly process, many mathematical models have been
proposed in the literature. In particular, abstract Tile Assembly Model (aTAM)
received much attention. In this work, we investigate pixel pattern generation
using aTAM. For a given image, a tile assembly system is given which can
generate the image by self-assembly process. We also consider image blocks with
specific cyclic pixel patterns (uniform shift and non uniform shift) self
assembly. A software, DNA Image Pro, for generating pixel patterns using DNA
tile assembly is also given.
"
709,Processing In-memory realization using Quantum Dot Cellular Automata,"  The present manuscript deals with the realization of Processing In-memory
(PIM) computing architecture using Quantum Dot Cellular Automata (QCA) and
Akers array. The PIM computing architecture becomes popular due to its
effective framework for storage and computation of data in a single unit. Here,
we illustrate two input NAND and NOR gate with the help of QCA based Akers
Array as a case study. The QCA flip-flop is used as a primitive cell to design
PIM architecture. The results suggested that both the gate have minimum power
dissipation. The polarization results of proposed architecture suggested that
the signals are in good control. The foot print of the primitive cell equals to
0.04 micron^2, which is smaller than conventional CMOS primitive cell. The
combination of QCA and Akers array provides many additional benefits over the
conventional architecture like reduction in the power consumption and feature
size, furthermore, it also improves the computational speed.

710,Scientific Computing Using Consumer Video-Gaming Hardware Devices,"  Commodity video-gaming hardware (consoles, graphics cards, tablets, etc.)
performance has been advancing at a rapid pace owing to strong consumer demand
and stiff market competition. Gaming hardware devices are currently amongst the
most powerful and cost-effective computational technologies available in
quantity. In this article, we evaluate a sample of current generation
video-gaming hardware devices for scientific computing and compare their
performance with specialized supercomputing general purpose graphics processing
units (GPGPUs). We use the OpenCL SHOC benchmark suite, which is a measure of
the performance of compute hardware on various different scientific application
kernels, and also a popular public distributed computing application,
Einstein@Home in the field of gravitational physics for the purposes of this
evaluation.
"
711,"Computing exponentially faster: Implementing a nondeterministic
  universal Turing machine using DNA","  The theory of computer science is based around Universal Turing Machines
(UTMs): abstract machines able to execute all possible algorithms. Modern
digital computers are physical embodiments of UTMs. The nondeterministic
polynomial (NP) time complexity class of problems is the most significant in
computer science, and an efficient (i.e. polynomial P) way to solve such
problems would be of profound economic and social importance. By definition
nondeterministic UTMs (NUTMs) solve NP complete problems in P time. However,
NUTMs have previously been believed to be physically impossible to construct.
Thue string rewriting systems are computationally equivalent to UTMs, and are
naturally nondeterministic. Here we describe the physical design for a NUTM
that implements a universal Thue system. The design exploits the ability of DNA
to replicate to execute an exponential number of computational paths in P time.
Each Thue rewriting step is embodied in a DNA edit implemented using a novel
combination of polymerase chain reactions and site-directed mutagenesis. We
demonstrate that this design works using both computational modelling and in
vitro molecular biology experimentation. The current design has limitations,
such as restricted error-correction. However, it opens up the prospect of
engineering NUTM based computers able to outperform all standard computers on
important practical problems.
"
712,"Read-Tuned STT-RAM and eDRAM Cache Hierarchies for Throughput and Energy
  Enhancement","  As capacity and complexity of on-chip cache memory hierarchy increases, the
service cost to the critical loads from Last Level Cache (LLC), which are
frequently repeated, has become a major concern. The processor may stall for a
considerable interval while waiting to access the data stored in the cache
blocks in LLC, if there are no independent instructions to execute. To provide
accelerated service to the critical loads requests from LLC, this work
concentrates on leveraging the additional capacity offered by replacing
SRAM-based L2 with Spin-Transfer Torque Random Access Memory (STT-RAM) to
accommodate frequently accessed cache blocks in exclusive read mode in favor of
reducing the overall read service time. Our proposed technique partitions L2
cache into two STT-RAM arrangements with different write performance and data
retention time. The retention-relaxed STT-RAM arrays are utilized to
effectively deal with the regular L2 cache requests while the high retention
STT-RAM arrays in L2 are selected for maintaining repeatedly read accessed
cache blocks from LLC by incurring negligible energy consumption for data
retention. Our experimental results show that the proposed technique can reduce
the mean L2 read miss ratio by 51.4% and increase the IPC by 11.7% on average
across PARSEC benchmark suite while significantly decreasing the total L2
energy consumption compared to conventional SRAM-based L2 design.
"
713,The Study of Transient Faults Propagation in Multithread Applications,"  Whereas contemporary Error Correcting Codes (ECC) designs occupy a
significant fraction of total die area in chip-multiprocessors (CMPs),
approaches to deal with the vulnerability increase of CMP architecture against
Single Event Upsets (SEUs) and Multi-Bit Upsets (MBUs) are sought. In this
paper, we focus on reliability assessment of multithreaded applications running
on CMPs to propose an adaptive application-relevant architecture design to
accommodate the impact of both SEUs and MBUs in the entire CMP architecture.
This work concentrates on leveraging the intrinsic soft-error-immunity feature
of Spin-Transfer Torque RAM (STT-RAM) as an alternative for SRAM-based storage
and operation components. We target a specific portion of working set for
reallocation to improve the reliability level of the CMP architecture design. A
selected portion of instructions in multithreaded program which experience high
rate of referencing with the lowest memory modification are ideal candidate to
be stored and executed in STT-RAM based components. We argue about why we
cannot use STT-RAM for the global storage and operation counterparts and
describe the obtained resiliency compared to the baseline setup. In addition, a
detail study of the impact of SEUs and MBUs on multithreaded programs will be
presented in the Appendix.
"
714,"On the Capacity of Diffusion-Based Molecular Communications with SiNW
  FET-Based Receiver","  Molecular communication (MC) is a bio-inspired communication method based on
the exchange of molecules for information transfer among nanoscale devices.
Although MC has been extensively studied from various aspects, limitations
imposed by the physical design of transceiving units have been largely
neglected in the literature. Recently, we have proposed a nanobioelectronic MC
receiver architecture based on the nanoscale field effect transistor-based
biosensor (bioFET) technology, providing noninvasive and sensitive molecular
detection at nanoscale while producing electrical signals at the output. In
this paper, we derive analytical closed-form expressions for the capacity and
capacity-achieving input distribution for a memoryless MC channel with a
silicon nanowire (SiNW) FET-based MC receiver. The resulting expressions could
be used to optimize the information flow in MC systems equipped with
nanobioelectronic receivers.

715,The blockchain: a new framework for robotic swarm systems,"  Swarms of robots will revolutionize many industrial applications, from
targeted material delivery to precision farming. However, several of the
heterogeneous characteristics that make them ideal for certain future
applications --- robot autonomy, decentralized control, collective emergent
behavior, etc. --- hinder the evolution of the technology from academic
institutions to real-world problems. Blockchain, an emerging technology
originated in the Bitcoin field, demonstrates that by combining peer-to-peer
networks with cryptographic algorithms a group of agents can reach an agreement
on a particular state of affairs and record that agreement without the need for
a controlling authority. The combination of blockchain with other distributed
systems, such as robotic swarm systems, can provide the necessary capabilities
to make robotic swarm operations more secure, autonomous, flexible and even
profitable. This work explains how blockchain technology can provide innovative
solutions to four emergent issues in the swarm robotics research field. New
security, decision making, behavior differentiation and business models for
swarm robotic systems are described by providing case scenarios and examples.
Finally, limitations and possible future problems that arise from the
combination of these two technologies are described.
"
716,"Ancilla-Input and Garbage-Output Optimized Design of a Reversible
  Quantum Integer Multiplier","  A reversible logic has application in quantum computing. A reversible logic
design needs resources such as ancilla and garbage qubits to reconfigure
circuit functions or gate functions. The removal of garbage qubits and ancilla
qubits are essential in designing an efficient quantum circuit. In the
literature, there are multiple designs that have been proposed for a reversible
multiplication operation. A multiplication hardware is essential for the
circuit design of quantum algorithms, quantum cryptanalysis, and digital signal
processing (DSP) applications. The existing designs of reversible quantum
integer multipliers suffer from redundant garbage qubits. In this work, we
propose a reversible logic based, garbage-free and ancilla qubit optimized
design of a quantum integer multiplier. The proposed quantum integer multiplier
utilizes a novel add and rotate methodology that is specially suitable for a
reversible computing paradigm. The proposed design methodology is the modified
version of a conventional shift and add method. The proposed design of the
quantum integer multiplier incorporates add or no operation based on multiplier
qubits and followed by a rotate right operation. The proposed design of the
quantum integer multiplier produces zero garbage qubits and shows an
improvement ranging from 60% to 90% in ancilla qubits count over the existing
work on reversible quantum integer multipliers.
"
717,A Computational Workflow for Designing Silicon Donor Qubits,"  Developing devices that can reliably and accurately demonstrate the
principles of superposition and entanglement is an on-going challenge for the
quantum computing community. Modeling and simulation offer attractive means of
testing early device designs and establishing expectations for operational
performance. However, the complex integrated material systems required by
quantum device designs are not captured by any single existing computational
modeling method. We examine the development and analysis of a multi-staged
computational workflow that can be used to design and characterize silicon
donor qubit systems with modeling and simulation. Our approach integrates
quantum computational chemistry calculations with electrostatic field solvers
to perform detailed simulations of a phosphorus dopant in silicon. We show how
atomistic details can be synthesized into an operational model for the logical
gates that define quantum computation in this particular technology. The
resulting computational workflow realizes a design tool for silicon donor
qubits that can help verify and validate current and near-term experimental
devices.
"
718,"Quantum algorithms for abelian difference sets and applications to
  dihedral hidden subgroups","  Difference sets are basic combinatorial structures that have applications in
signal processing, coding theory, and cryptography. We consider the problem of
identifying a shifted version of the characteristic function of a (known)
difference set. We present a generic quantum algorithm that can be used to
tackle any hidden shift problem for any difference set in any abelian group. We
discuss special cases of this framework where the resulting quantum algorithm
is efficient. This includes: a) Paley difference sets based on quadratic
residues in finite fields, which allows to recover the shifted Legendre
function quantum algorithm, b) Hadamard difference sets, which allows to
recover the shifted bent function quantum algorithm, and c) Singer difference
sets based on finite geometries. The latter class allows us to define instances
of the dihedral hidden subgroup problem that can be efficiently solved on a
quantum computer.
"
719,"Universal Simulation of Directed Systems in the abstract Tile Assembly
  Model Requires Undirectedness","  As a mathematical model of self-assembling systems, Winfree's abstract Tile
Assembly Model (aTAM) is a remarkable platform for studying the behaviors and
powers of self-assembling systems. Capable of Turing universal computation, the
aTAM allows algorithmic self-assembly, in which the components can be designed
so that the rules governing their behaviors force them to inherently execute
prescribed algorithms as they combine. Adding to its completeness, the aTAM was
shown to also be intrinsically universal, which means that there exists a
single tile set such that for any arbitrary input aTAM system, that tile set
can be configured into a seed structure which will then cause self-assembly
using that tile set to simulate the input system, capturing its full dynamics
modulo only a scale factor. However, the universal simulator previously given
makes use of nondeterminism in terms of tile types placed in several key
locations when different assembly sequences are followed, even when simulating
a directed system, meaning one that has exactly one unique terminal assembly.
The question then became whether or not that nondeterminism is fundamentally
required. Here, we answer that in the affirmative: the class of directed
systems in the aTAM is not intrinsically universal, meaning there is no
universal simulator for directed systems which itself is always directed. This
provides insight into the role of nondeterminism in self-assembly, which is
itself a fundamentally nondeterministic process. To achieve this result we
leverage powerful results of computational complexity hierarchies, including
tight bounds on both best and worst-case complexities of decidable languages,
to design systems with precisely controllable space resources available to
embedded computations. We also develop novel techniques for designing systems
containing subsystems with disjoint, mutually exclusive computational powers.
"
720,A Practical Quantum Instruction Set Architecture,"  We introduce an abstract machine architecture for classical/quantum
computations---including compilation---along with a quantum instruction
language called Quil for explicitly writing these computations. With this
formalism, we discuss concrete implementations of the machine and non-trivial
algorithms targeting them. The introduction of this machine dovetails with
ongoing development of quantum computing technology, and makes possible
portable descriptions of recent classical/quantum algorithms.
"
721,"Quantum-limited measurements of optical signals from a geostationary
  satellite","  The measurement of quantum signals that traveled through long distances is of
fundamental and technological interest. We present quantum-limited coherent
measurements of optical signals, sent from a satellite in geostationary Earth
orbit to an optical ground station. We bound the excess noise that the quantum
states could have acquired after having propagated 38600 km through Earth's
gravitational potential as well as its turbulent atmosphere. Our results
indicate that quantum communication is feasible in principle in such a
scenario, highlighting the possibility of a global quantum key distribution
network for secure communication.
"
722,Evaluating Spintronic Devices Using The Modular Approach,"  Over the past decade a large family of spintronic devices have been proposed
as candidates for replacing CMOS for future digital logic circuits. Using the
recently developed Modular Approach framework, we investigate and identify the
physical bottlenecks and engineering challenges facing current spintronic
devices. We then evaluate how systematic advancements in material properties
and device design innovations impact the performance of spintronic devices, as
a possible continuation of Moore's Law, even though some of these projections
are speculative and may require technological breakthroughs. Lastly, we
illustrate the use of the Modular Approach as an exploratory tool for
probabilistic networks, using superparamagnetic magnets as building blocks for
such networks. These building blocks leverage the inherent physics of
stochastic spin-torque switching and could provide ultra-compact and efficient
hardware for beyond-Boolean computational paradigms.
"
723,Machine Learning with Memristors via Thermodynamic RAM,"  Thermodynamic RAM (kT-RAM) is a neuromemristive co-processor design based on
the theory of AHaH Computing and implemented via CMOS and memristors. The
co-processor is a 2-D array of differential memristor pairs (synapses) that can
be selectively coupled together (neurons) via the digital bit addressing of the
underlying CMOS RAM circuitry. The chip is designed to plug into existing
digital computers and be interacted with via a simple instruction set.
Anti-Hebbian and Hebbian (AHaH) computing forms the theoretical framework from
which a nature-inspired type of computing architecture is built where, unlike
von Neumann architectures, memory and processor are physically combined for
synaptic operations. Through exploitation of AHaH attractor states,
memristor-based circuits converge to attractor basins that represents machine
learning solutions such as unsupervised feature learning, supervised
classification and anomaly detection. Because kT-RAM eliminates the need to
shuttle bits back and forth between memory and processor and can operate at
very low voltage levels, it can significantly surpass CPU, GPU, and FPGA
performance for synaptic integration and learning operations. Here, we present
a memristor technology developed for use in kT-RAM, in particular
bi-directional incremental adaptation of conductance via short low-voltage 1.0
V, 1.0 microsecond pulses.
"
724,The Generalized Metastable Switch Memristor Model,"  Memristor device modeling is currently a heavily researched topic and is
becoming ever more important as memristor devices make their way into CMOS
circuit designs, necessitating accurate and efficient memristor circuit
simulations. In this paper, the Generalized Metastable Switch (MSS) memristor
model is presented. The Generalized MSS model consists of a voltage-dependent
stochastic component and a voltage-dependent exponential diode current
component and is designed to be easy to implement, computationally efficient,
and amenable to modeling a wide range of different memristor devices.
"
725,"Synchronization dynamics on the picosecond timescale in coupled
  Josephson junction neurons","  Conventional digital computation is rapidly approaching physical limits for
speed and energy dissipation. Here we fabricate and test a simple neuromorphic
circuit that models neuronal somas, axons and synapses with superconducting
Josephson junctions. The circuit models two mutually coupled excitatory
neurons. In some regions of parameter space the neurons are desynchronized. In
others, the Josephson neurons synchronize in one of two states, in-phase or
anti-phase. An experimental alteration of the delay and strength of the
connecting synapses can toggle the system back and forth in a phase-flip
bifurcation. Firing synchronization states are calculated >70,000 times faster
than conventional digital approaches. With their speed and low energy
dissipation (10-17 Joules/spike), this set of proof-of- concept experiments
establishes Josephson junction neurons as a viable approach for improvements in
neuronal computation as well as applications in neuromorphic computing.
"
726,A Reconfigurable FIR Filter with Memristor-Based Weights,"  We report on experimental demonstration of a mixed-signal 6-tap
finite-impulse response (FIR) filter in which weights are implemented with
titanium dioxide memristive devices. In the proposed design weight of a tap is
stored with a relatively high precision in a memristive device that can be
configured in field. Such approach enables efficient implementation of the most
critical operation of an FIR filter, i.e. multiplication of the input signal
with the tap weights and summation of the products from taps, in analog domain.
As a result, the proposed design, when implemented with fully integrated hybrid
CMOS/memristor circuit, is expected to be much more compact and energy
efficient as compared to the state-of-the-art approaches.
"
727,"Computing with Dynamical Systems Based on Insulator-Metal-Transition
  Oscillators","  In this paper we review recent work on novel computing paradigms using
coupled oscillatory dynamical systems. We explore systems of relaxation
oscillators based on linear state transitioning devices, which switch between
two discrete states with hysteresis. By harnessing the dynamics of complex,
connected systems we embrace the philosophy of ""let physics do the computing""
and demonstrate how complex phase and frequency dynamics of such systems can be
controlled, programmed and observed to solve computationally hard problems.
Although our discussion in this paper is limited to Insulator-to-Metallic (IMT)
state transition devices, the general philosophy of such computing paradigms
can be translated to other mediums including optical systems. We present the
necessary mathematical treatments necessary to understand the time evolution of
these systems and demonstrate through recent experimental results the potential
of such computational primitives.
"
728,"Design-Space Exploration and Optimization of an Energy-Efficient and
  Reliable 3D Small-world Network-on-Chip","  A three-dimensional (3D) Network-on-Chip (NoC) enables the design of high
performance and low power many-core chips. Existing 3D NoCs are inadequate for
meeting the ever-increasing performance requirements of many-core processors
since they are simple extensions of regular 2D architectures and they do not
fully exploit the advantages provided by 3D integration. Moreover, the
anticipated performance gain of a 3D NoC-enabled many-core chip may be
compromised due to the potential failures of through-silicon-vias (TSVs) that
are predominantly used as vertical interconnects in a 3D IC. To address these
problems, we propose a machine-learning-inspired predictive design methodology
for energy-efficient and reliable many-core architectures enabled by 3D
integration. We demonstrate that a small-world network-based 3D NoC (3D SWNoC)
performs significantly better than its 3D MESH-based counterparts. On average,
the 3D SWNoC shows 35% energy-delay-product (EDP) improvement over 3D MESH for
the PARSEC and SPLASH2 benchmarks considered in this work. To improve the
reliability of 3D NoC, we propose a computationally efficient spare-vertical
link (sVL) allocation algorithm based on a state-space search formulation. Our
results show that the proposed sVL allocation algorithm can significantly
improve the reliability as well as the lifetime of 3D SWNoC.

729,Reduction of Self-heating effect in LDMOS devices,"  Isotopic purification of group IV elements leads to substantial increase in
thermal conductivity due to reduced scattering of the phonons. Based on this
concept, a simulation study is used to demonstrate the reduction of at least 25
oC in LDMOS average temperature.
"
730,Magnetic skyrmion-based synaptic devices,"  Magnetic skyrmions are promising candidates for next-generation information
carriers, owing to their small size, topological stability, and ultralow
depinning current density. A wide variety of skyrmionic device concepts and
prototypes have been proposed, highlighting their potential applications. Here,
we report on a bioinspired skyrmionic device with synaptic plasticity. The
synaptic weight of the proposed device can be strengthened/weakened by
positive/negative stimuli, mimicking the potentiation/depression process of a
biological synapse. Both short-term plasticity(STP) and long-term
potentiation(LTP) functionalities have been demonstrated for a spiking
time-dependent plasticity(STDP) scheme. This proposal suggests new
possibilities for synaptic devices for use in spiking neuromorphic computing
applications.
"
731,Chemical Propagation Pattern for Molecular Communications,"  In a diffusion-based molecular communication system, molecules are employed
to convey information. When propagation and reception processes are considered
in a framework of first passage processes, we need to focus on absorbing
receivers. For this kind of molecular communication system, the characteristics
of the channel is also affected by the shape of the transmitter. In the
literature, most studies focus on systems with a point transmitter due to
circular symmetry. In this letter, we address propagation and reception pattern
for chemical signals emitted from a spherical transmitter. We also investigate
the directivity gain achieved by the reflecting spherical transmitter. We
quantify the power gain by measuring the received power at different angles on
a circular region. Moreover, we define three metrics, i.e., the half-power
pattern-width, the directivity gain, and the peak time of the signal, for
analyzing the received signal pattern.
"
732,Two-Time-Slot Bidirectional Relaying in Molecular Communication,"  In this paper, we study the bidirectional/two-way relaying of molecular
communication and propose a relaying scheme with two time slots. Compared to
the four-time-slot and three-time-slot schemes, the proposed two-time-slot
scheme improves the throughput by a significant extent by allowing the end
nodes to transmit simultaneously at the very first time slot. In contrast to
the existing techniques, the proposed scheme employs a homogeneous molecular
communication for bidirectional relaying where all the nodes (i.e., end nodes
and relay node) are allowed to operate on the same type of molecule instead of
utilizing different types of molecule for different nodes. As a result, this
proposal of homogeneous molecular relaying remarkably improves the resource
reuse capability. This paper generically characterizes the transmission and
detection strategies of the proposed scheme. Moreover, we derive the analytical
bit error probabilities for the multiple access and broadcast phases and
present the end-to-end bit error probability of the proposed scheme. It's
noteworthy that we take it into account the effect of molecular interference in
the theoretical derivations. Extensive simulation is carried out, and it is
shown that simulation results match very well with the derived theoretical

733,Modeling The Adaption Rule in Context-aware Systems,"  Context awareness is increasingly gaining applicability in interactive
ubiquitous mobile computing systems. Each context-aware application has its own
set of behaviors to react to context modifications. This paper is concerned
with the context modeling and the development methodology for context-aware
systems. We proposed a rule-based approach and use the adaption tree to model
the adaption rule of context-aware systems. We illustrate this idea in an
arithmetic game application.

734,"Vertex coloring of graphs via phase dynamics of coupled oscillatory
  networks","  While Boolean logic has been the backbone of digital information processing,
there are classes of computationally hard problems wherein this conventional
paradigm is fundamentally inefficient. Vertex coloring of graphs, belonging to
the class of combinatorial optimization represents such a problem; and is well
studied for its wide spectrum of applications in data sciences, life sciences,
social sciences and engineering and technology. This motivates alternate, and
more efficient non-Boolean pathways to their solution. Here, we demonstrate a
coupled relaxation oscillator based dynamical system that exploits the
insulator-metal transition in vanadium dioxide (VO2), to efficiently solve the
vertex coloring of graphs. By harnessing the natural analogue between
optimization, pertinent to graph coloring solutions, and energy minimization
processes in highly parallel, interconnected dynamical systems, we harness the
physical manifestation of the latter process to approximate the optimal
coloring of k-partite graphs. We further indicate a fundamental connection
between the eigen properties of a linear dynamical system and the spectral
algorithms that can solve approximate graph coloring. Our work not only
elucidates a physics-based computing approach but also presents tantalizing
opportunities for building customized analog co-processors for solving hard
problems efficiently.
"
735,On the Impact of Time-Synchronization in Molecular Timing Channels,"  This work studies the impact of time- synchronization in molecular timing
(MT) channels by analyzing three different modulation techniques. The first
requires transmitter-receiver synchronization and is based on modulating
information on the release timing of information particles. The other two are
asynchronous and are based on modulating information on the relative time
between two consecutive releases of information particles using
indistinguishable or distinguishable particles. All modulation schemes result
in a system that relate the transmitted and the received signals through an
additive noise, which follows a stable distribution. As the common notion of
the variance of a signal is not suitable for defining the power of stable
distributed signals (due to infinite variance), we derive an expression for the
geometric power of a large class of stable distributions, and then use this
result to characterize the geometric signal-to-noise ratio (G-SNR) for each of
the modulation techniques. In addition, for binary communication, we derive the
optimal detection rules for each modulation technique. Numerical evaluations
indicate that the bit error rate (BER) is constant for a given G-SNR, and the
performance gain obtained by using synchronized communication is significant.
Yet, it is also shown that by using two distinguishable particles per bit
instead of one, the BER of the asynchronous technique can approach that of the
synchronous one.
"
736,Practical Demonstration of a Memristive Fuse,"  Since its inception the memristive fuse has been a good example of how small
numbers of memristors can be combined to obtain useful behaviours unachievable
by individual devices. In this work, we link the memristive fuse concept with
that of the Complementary Resistive Switch (CRS), exploit that link to
experimentally demonstrate a practical memristive fuse using TiOx-based ReRAM
cells and explain its basic operational principles. The fuse is stimulated by
trains of identical pulses where successive pulse trains feature opposite
polarities. In response, we observe a gradual (analogue) drop in resistive
state followed by a gradual recovery phase regardless of input stimulus
polarity; echoing traditional, binary CRS behaviour. This analogue switching
property opens the possibility of operating the memristive fuse as a
single-component step change detector. Moreover, we discover that the
characteristics of the individual memristors used to demonstrate the memristive
fuse concept in this work allow our fuse to be operated in a regime where one
of the two constituent devices can be switched largely independently from the
other. This property, not present in the traditional CRS, indicates that the
inherently analogue memristive fuse architecture may support additional
operational flexibility through e.g. allowing finer control over its resistive
state.
"
737,"A light-stimulated neuromorphic device based on graphene hybrid
  phototransistor","  Neuromorphic chip refers to an unconventional computing architecture that is
modelled on biological brains. It is ideally suited for processing sensory data
for intelligence computing, decision-making or context cognition. Despite rapid
development, conventional artificial synapses exhibit poor connection
flexibility and require separate data acquisition circuitry, resulting in
limited functionalities and significant hardware redundancy. Here we report a
novel light-stimulated artificial synapse based on a graphene-nanotube hybrid
phototransistor that can directly convert optical stimuli into a ""neural image""
for further neuronal analysis. Our optically-driven synapses involve multiple
steps of plasticity mechanisms and importantly exhibit flexible tuning of both
short- and long-term plasticity. Furthermore, our neuromorphic phototransistor
can take multiple pre-synaptic light stimuli via wavelength-division
multiplexing and allows advanced optical processing through
charge-trap-mediated optical coupling. The capability of complex neuromorphic
functionalities in a simple silicon-compatible device paves the way for novel
neuromorphic computing architectures involving photonics.
"
738,Topological field theory and computing with instantons,"  Chern-Simons topological field theories TFTs are the only TFTs that have
already found application in the description of some exotic strongly-correlated
electron systems and the corresponding concept of topological quantum
computing. Here, we show that TFTs of another type, specifically the
gauge-field-less Witten-type TFTs known as topological sigma models, describe
the recently proposed digital memcomputing machines (DMMs) - engineered
dynamical systems with point attractors being the solutions of the
corresponding logic circuit that solves a specific task. This result derives
from the recent finding that any stochastic differential equation possesses a
topological supersymmetry, and the realization that the solution search by a
DMM proceeds via an instantonic phase. Certain TFT correlators in DMMs then
reveal the presence of a transient long-range order both in space and time,
associated with the effective breakdown of the topological supersymmetry by
instantons. The ensuing non-locality and the low dimensionality of instantons
are the physical reasons why DMMs can solve complex problems efficiently,
despite their non-quantum character. We exemplify these results with the
solution of prime factorization.
"
739,"Nonvolatile Multi-level Memory and Boolean Logic Gates Based on a Single
  Memtranstor","  Memtranstor that correlates charge and magnetic flux via nonlinear
magnetoelectric effects has a great potential in developing next-generation
nonvolatile devices. In addition to multi-level nonvolatile memory, we
demonstrate here that nonvolatile logic gates such as NOR and NAND can be
implemented in a single memtranstor made of the Ni/PMN-PT/Ni heterostructure.
After applying two sequent voltage pulses (X1, X2) as the logic inputs on the
memtranstor, the output magnetoelectric voltage can be positive high (logic
""1""), positive low (logic ""0""), or negative (logic ""0""), depending on the
levels of X1 and X2. The underlying physical mechanism is related to the
complete or partial reversal of ferroelectric polarization controlled by
inputting selective voltage pulses, which determines the magnitude and sign of
the magnetoelectric voltage coefficient. The combined functions of both memory
and logic could enable the memtranstor as a promising candidate for future
computing systems beyond von Neumann architecture.
"
740,Feynman Machine: The Universal Dynamical Systems Computer,"  Efforts at understanding the computational processes in the brain have met
with limited success, despite their importance and potential uses in building
intelligent machines. We propose a simple new model which draws on recent
findings in Neuroscience and the Applied Mathematics of interacting Dynamical
Systems. The Feynman Machine is a Universal Computer for Dynamical Systems,
analogous to the Turing Machine for symbolic computing, but with several
important differences. We demonstrate that networks and hierarchies of simple
interacting Dynamical Systems, each adaptively learning to forecast its
evolution, are capable of automatically building sensorimotor models of the
external and internal world. We identify such networks in mammalian neocortex,
and show how existing theories of cortical computation combine with our model
to explain the power and flexibility of mammalian intelligence. These findings
lead directly to new architectures for machine intelligence. A suite of
software implementations has been built based on these principles, and applied
to a number of spatiotemporal learning tasks.
"
741,Voltage Controlled Memristor Threshold Logic Gates,"  In this paper, we present a resistive switching memristor cell for
implementing universal logic gates. The cell has a weighted control input whose
resistance is set based on a control signal that generalizes the operational
regime from NAND to NOR functionality. We further show how threshold logic in
the voltage-controlled resistive cell can be used to implement a XOR logic.
Building on the same principle we implement a half adder and a 4-bit CLA (Carry
Look-ahead Adder) and show that in comparison with CMOS-only logic, the
proposed system shows significant improvements in terms of device area, power
dissipation and leakage power.
"
742,CMOS-Memristor Dendrite Threshold Circuits,"  Non-linear neuron models overcomes the limitations of linear binary models of
neurons that have the inability to compute linearly non-separable functions
such as XOR. While several biologically plausible models based on dendrite
thresholds are reported in the previous studies, the hardware implementation of
such non-linear neuron models remain as an open problem. In this paper, we
propose a circuit design for implementing logical dendrite non-linearity
response of dendrite spike and saturation types. The proposed dendrite cells
are used to build XOR circuit and intensity detection circuit that consists of
different combinations of dendrite cells with saturating and spiking responses.
The dendrite cells are designed using a set of memristors, Zener diodes, and
CMOS NOT gates. The circuits are designed, analyzed and verified on circuit
boards.
"
743,STEM: A Scheme for Two-phase Evaluation of Majority Logic,"  The switching time of a magnet in a spin current based majority gate depends
on the input vector combination, and this often restricts the speed of
majority-based circuits. To address this issue, this work proposes a novel
two-phase scheme to implement majority logic and evaluates it on an all-spin
logic (ASL) majority-based logic structures. In Phase 1, the output is
initialized to a preset value. Next in Phase 2, the inputs are evaluated to
switch the output magnet to its correct value. The time window for the output
to switch in Phase 2 is fixed. Using such a scheme, an n-input AND gate which
requires a total of (2n-1) inputs in the conventional implementation can now be
implemented with only (n+1) inputs. When applied to standard logic functions,
it is demonstrated that the proposed method of designing ASL gates are 1.6-3.4X
faster and 1.9-6.9X more energy-efficient than the conventional method, and for
a five-magnet full adder, it is shown that the proposed ASL implementation is
1.5X faster, 2.2X more energy-efficient, and provides a 16% improvement in
area.
"
744,Scaling up Echo-State Networks with multiple light scattering,"  Echo-State Networks and Reservoir Computing have been studied for more than a
decade. They provide a simpler yet powerful alternative to Recurrent Neural
Networks, every internal weight is fixed and only the last linear layer is
trained. They involve many multiplications by dense random matrices. Very large
networks are difficult to obtain, as the complexity scales quadratically both
in time and memory. Here, we present a novel optical implementation of
Echo-State Networks using light-scattering media and a Digital Micromirror
Device. As a proof of concept, binary networks have been successfully trained
to predict the chaotic Mackey-Glass time series. This new method is fast, power
efficient and easily scalable to very large networks.
"
745,Ultrafast photo-magnetic recording in transparent medium,"  Finding a conceptually new way to control the magnetic state of media with
the lowest possible production of heat and simultaneously at the fastest
possible time-scale is a new challenge in fundamental magnetism [1-4] as well
as an increasingly important issue in modern information technology [5]. Recent
results demonstrate that exclusively in metals it is possible to switch
magnetization between metastable states by femtosecond circularly polarized
laser pulses [6-8]. However, despite the record breaking speed of the
switching, the mechanisms in these materials are directly related to strong
optical absorption and laser-induced heating close to the Curie temperature
[9-12]. Here we report about ultrafast all-optical photo-magnetic recording in
transparent dielectrics. In ferrimagnetic garnet film a single linearly
polarized femtosecond laser pulse breaks the degeneracy between metastable
magnetic states and promotes switching of spins between them. Changing the
polarization of the laser pulse we deterministically steer the net
magnetization in the garnet, write ""0"" and ""1"" magnetic bits at will. This
mechanism operates at room temperature and allows ever fastest write-read
magnetic recording event (< 20 ps) accompanied by unprecedentedly low heat load
(< 6 J/cm3).
"
746,A Computation in a Cellular Automaton Collider Rule 110,"  A cellular automaton collider is a finite state machine build of rings of
one-dimensional cellular automata. We show how a computation can be performed
on the collider by exploiting interactions between gliders (particles,
localisations). The constructions proposed are based on universality of
elementary cellular automaton rule 110, cyclic tag systems, supercolliders, and
computing on rings.
"
747,"Ising spin model using Spin-Hall Effect (SHE) induced magnetization
  reversal in Magnetic-Tunnel-Junction","  Ising spin model is considered as an efficient computing method to solve
combinatorial optimization problems based on its natural tendency of
convergence towards low energy state. The underlying basic functions
facilitating the Ising model can be categorized into two parts, ""Annealing and
Majority vote"". In this paper, we propose an Ising cell based on Spin Hall
Effect (SHE) induced magnetization switching in a Magnetic Tunnel Junction
(MTJ). The stochasticity of our proposed Ising cell based on SHE induced MTJ
switching, can implement the natural annealing process by preventing the system
from being stuck in solutions with local minima. Further, by controlling the
current through the Heavy-Metal (HM) underlying the MTJ, we can mimic the
majority vote function which determines the next state of the individual spins.
By solving coupled \textit{Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert} (LLG) equations, we
demonstrate that our Ising cell can be replicated to map certain combinatorial
problems. We present results for two representative problems - Maximum-cut and
Graph coloring - to illustrate the feasibility of the proposed device-circuit
configuration in solving combinatorial problems. Our proposed solution using a
Heavy Metal (HM) based MTJ device can be exploited to implement compact, fast,
and energy efficient Ising spin model.
"
748,"Low-power Spin Valve Logic using Spin-transfer Torque with Automotion of
  Domain Walls","  A novel scheme for non-volatile digital computation is proposed using
spin-transfer torque (STT) and automotion of magnetic domain walls (DWs). The
basic computing element is composed of a lateral spin valve (SV) with two
ferromagnetic (FM) wires served as interconnects, where DW automotion is used
to propagate the information from one device to another. The non-reciprocity of
both device and interconnect is realized by sizing different contact areas at
the input and the output as well as enhancing the local damping mechanism. The
proposed logic is suitable for scaling due to a high energy barrier provided by
a long FM wire. Compared to the scheme based on non-local spin valves (NLSVs)
in the previous proposal, the devices can be operated at lower current density
due to utilizing all injected spins for local magnetization reversals, and thus
improve both energy efficiency and resistance to electromigration. This device
concept is justified by simulating a buffer, an inverter, and a 3-input
majority gate with comprehensive numerical simulations, including spin
transport through the FM/non-magnetic (NM) interfaces as well as the NM channel
and stochastic magnetization dynamics inside FM wires. In addition to digital
computing, the proposed framework can also be used as a transducer between DWs
and spin currents for higher wiring flexibility in the interconnect network.

749,RNA as a Nanoscale Data Transmission Medium: Error Analysis,"  RNA can be used as a high-density medium for data storage and transmission;
however, an important RNA process -- replication -- is noisy. This paper
presents an error analysis for RNA as a data transmission medium, analyzing how
deletion errors increase in a collection of replicated DNA strands over time.
"
750,"From Digital computers to quantum computers based on biological
  paradigms and progress in particle physics","  While several paths have emerged in microelectronics and computing as
follow-ons to Turing architectures, and have been implemented using essentially
silicon circuits, very little beyond Moore research has considered: (1) first
biological processes instead of sequential instructions, and, (2) the
implementation of these processes exploiting particle physics interactions.
This last combination enables native spatial-temporal integration and
correlation, but also powerful interference filtering, gating, splitting and
more. These biological functions, their realization by quantum and charge
carrier interactions, allow proposing a novel computing architecture, with
interfaces, information storage, and programmability. The paper presents the
underlying biological processes, the particle physics phenomena which are
exploited, and the proposed architecture, as well as an algebraic design
formalism.
"
751,Multi-Valued Routing Tracks for FPGAs in 28nm FDSOI Technology,"  In this paper we present quaternary and ternary routing tracks for FPGAs, and
their implementation in 28nm FDSOI technology. We discuss the transistor level
design of multi-valued repeaters, multiplexers and translators, and specific
features of FDSOI technology which make it possible. Next we compare the
multi-valued routing architectures with equivalent single driver two-valued
routing architectures. We show that for long tracks, it is possible to achieve
upto 3x reduction in dynamic switching energy, upto 2x reduction in routing
wire area and 10% reduction in area dedicated to routing resources. The
multi-valued tracks are slightly more susceptible to process variation. We
present a layout method for multivalued standard cells and determine the layout
overhead.We conclude with various usage scenarios of these tracks.
"
752,"Training a Probabilistic Graphical Model with Resistive Switching
  Electronic Synapses","  Current large scale implementations of deep learning and data mining require
thousands of processors, massive amounts of off-chip memory, and consume
gigajoules of energy. Emerging memory technologies such as nanoscale
two-terminal resistive switching memory devices offer a compact, scalable and
low power alternative that permits on-chip co-located processing and memory in
fine-grain distributed parallel architecture. Here we report first use of
resistive switching memory devices for implementing and training a Restricted
Boltzmann Machine (RBM), a generative probabilistic graphical model as a key
component for unsupervised learning in deep networks. We experimentally
demonstrate a 45-synapse RBM realized with 90 resistive switching phase change
memory (PCM) elements trained with a bio-inspired variant of the Contrastive
Divergence (CD) algorithm, implementing Hebbian and anti-Hebbian weight
updates. The resistive PCM devices show a two-fold to ten-fold reduction in
error rate in a missing pixel pattern completion task trained over 30 epochs,
compared to untrained case. Measured programming energy consumption is 6.1 nJ
per epoch with the resistive switching PCM devices, a factor of ~150 times
lower than conventional processor-memory systems. We analyze and discuss the
dependence of learning performance on cycle-to-cycle variations as well as
number of gradual levels in the PCM analog memory devices.
"
753,A Nondeterministic Model for Abstract Geometrical Computation,"  A signal machine is an abstract geometrical model for computation, proposed
as an extension to the one-dimensional cellular automata, in which discrete
time and space of cellular automata is replaced with continuous time and space
in signal machine. A signal machine is defined as a set of meta-signals and a
set of rules. A signal machine starts from an initial configuration which is a
set of moving signals. Signals are moving in space freely until a collision.
Rules of signal machine specify what happens after a collision, or in other
words, specify out-coming signals for each set of colliding signals. Originally
signal machine is defined by its rule as a deterministic machine. In this
paper, we introduce the concept of non-deterministic signal machine, which may
contain more than one defined rule for each set of colliding signals. We show
that for a specific class of nondeterministic signal machines, called
k-restricted nondeterministic signal machine, there is a deterministic signal
machine computing the same result as the nondeterministic one, on any given
initial configuration. k-restricted nondeterministic signal machine is a
nondeterministic signal machine which accepts an input iff produces a special
accepting signal, which have at most two nondeterministic rule for each
collision, and at most k collisions before any acceptance.

754,"Sub-1-us, Sub-20-nJ Pattern Classification in a Mixed-Signal Circuit
  Based on Embedded 180-nm Floating-Gate Memory Cell Arrays","  We have designed, fabricated, and successfully tested a prototype
mixed-signal, 28x28-binary-input, 10-output, 3-layer neuromorphic network (""MLP
perceptron""). It is based on embedded nonvolatile floating-gate cell arrays
redesigned from a commercial 180-nm NOR flash memory. The arrays allow precise
(~1%) individual tuning of all memory cells, having long-term analog-level
retention and low noise. Each array performs a very fast and energy-efficient
analog vector-by-matrix multiplication, which is the bottleneck for signal
propagation in most neuromorphic networks. All functional components of the
prototype circuit, including 2 synaptic arrays with 101,780 floating-gate
synaptic cells, 74 analog neurons, and the peripheral circuitry for weight
adjustment and I/O operations, have a total area below 1 mm^2. Its testing on
the common MNIST benchmark set (at this stage, with a relatively low weight
import precision) has shown a classification fidelity of 94.65%, close to the
96.2% obtained in simulation. The classification of one pattern takes less than
1 us time and ~20 nJ energy - both numbers much better than for digital
implementations of the same task. Estimates show that this performance may be
further improved using a better neuron design and a more advanced memory
technology, leading to a >10^2 advantage in speed and a >10^4 advantage in
energy efficiency over the state-of-the-art purely digital (GPU and custom)
circuits, at classification of large, complex patterns.
"
755,"Straintronic magneto-tunneling-junction based ternary content
  addressable memory","  Straintronic magneto-tunneling junction (s-MTJ) switches, whose resistances
are controlled with voltage-generated strain in the magnetostrictive free layer
of the MTJ, are extremely energy-efficient switches that would dissipate a few
aJ of energy during switching. Unfortunately, they are also relatively
error-prone and have low resistance on/off ratio. This suggests that as
computing elements, they are best suited for non-Boolean architectures. Here,
we propose and analyze a ternary content addressable memory implemented with
s-MTJs and some transistors. It overcomes challenges encountered by traditional
all-transistor implementations, resulting in exceptionally high cell density.
"
756,"Metastable Memristive Lines for Signal Transmission and Information
  Processing Applications","  Traditional studies of memristive devices have mainly focused on their
applications in non-volatile information storage and information processing.
Here, we demonstrate that the third fundamental component of information
technologies { the transfer of information { can also be employed with
memristive devices. For this purpose, we introduce a metastable memristive
circuit. Combining metastable memristive circuits into a line, one obtains an
architecture capable of transferring a signal edge from one space location to
another. We emphasize that the suggested transmission lines employ only
resistive components. Moreover, their networks (for example, Y-connected lines)
have an information processing capability.
"
757,On plant roots logical gates,"  Theoretical constructs of logical gates implemented with plant roots are
morphological computing asynchronous devices. Values of Boolean variables are
represented by plant roots. A presence of a plant root at a given site
symbolises the logical {\sc True}, an absence the logical {\sc False}. Logical
functions are calculated via interaction between roots. Two types of
two-inputs-two-outputs gates are proposed: a gate $\langle x, y \rangle
\rightarrow \langle xy, x+y \rangle$ where root apexes are guided by gravity
and a gate $\langle x, y \rangle \rightarrow \langle \overline{x}y, x \rangle$
where root apexes are guided by humidity. We propose a design of binary
half-adder based on the gates.
"
758,CMOS-Memristor Hybrid Integrated Pixel Sensors,"  Increase in image resolution require the ability of image sensors to pack an
increased number of circuit components in a given area. On the the other hand a
high speed processing of signals from the sensors require the ability of pixel
to carry out pixel parallel operations. In the paper, we propose a modified 3T
and 4T CMOS wide dynamic range pixels, which we refer as 2T-M and 3T-M
configurations, comprising of MOSFETS and memristors. The low leakage currents
and low area of memristors helps to achieve the objective of reducing the area,
while the possibility to create arrays of memristors and MOSFETs across
different layers within the chip, ensure the possibility to scale the circuit
architecture.
"
759,Active matter logic for autonomous microfluidics,"  Chemically or optically powered active matter plays an increasingly important
role in materials design but its computational potential has yet to be explored
systematically. The competition between energy consumption and dissipation
imposes stringent physical constraints on the information transport in active
flow networks, facilitating global optimization strategies that are not well
understood. Here, we combine insights from recent microbial experiments with
concepts from lattice-field theory and non-equilibrium statistical mechanics to
introduce a generic theoretical framework for active matter logic (AML).
Highlighting conceptual differences with classical and quantum computation, we
demonstrate how the inherent non-locality of incompressible active flow
networks can be utilized to construct universal logical operations, Fredkin
gates and memory storage in SR latches through the synchronized
self-organization of many individual network components. Our work lays the
conceptual foundation for developing autonomous microfluidic transport devices
driven by bacterial fluids, active liquid crystals or chemically engineered
motile colloids.
"
760,Design of a Compact Reversible Read-Only-Memory with MOS Transistors,"  Energy conservative devices are the need of the modern technology which leads
to the development of reversible logic. The synthesis of reversible logic has
become an intensely studied area as it overcomes the problem of power
dissipation associated with irreversibility. Storage device such as
Read-Only-Memory (ROM) can be realized in a reversible way with low power
dissipation. The reversibility of ROM has not been yet realized in literature
and hence, this paper presents a novel reversible ROM with its Complementary
Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) realization. On the way to present the
architecture of reversible ROM, we propose a new reversible gate named as
Nowrin Papiya (NP) gate. All the proposed circuits and gates are realized with
CMOS based pass transistor logic. Finally, an algorithm as well as several
theorems on the numbers of gates, transistors and garbage outputs have been
presented to show the optimality of the reversible ROM. Simulations using
Microwind DSCH software has been shown to verify the correctness of the
proposed design. The comparative results prove that the proposed designs are
efficient and optimized in terms of numbers of gates, transistors, garbage
outputs, quantum cost and delay.
"
761,"Online Training of an Opto-Electronic Reservoir Computer Applied to
  Real-Time Channel Equalisation","  Reservoir Computing is a bio-inspired computing paradigm for processing time
dependent signals. The performance of its analogue implementation are
comparable to other state of the art algorithms for tasks such as speech
recognition or chaotic time series prediction, but these are often constrained
by the offline training methods commonly employed. Here we investigated the
online learning approach by training an opto-electronic reservoir computer
using a simple gradient descent algorithm, programmed on an FPGA chip. Our
system was applied to wireless communications, a quickly growing domain with an
increasing demand for fast analogue devices to equalise the nonlinear distorted
channels. We report error rates up to two orders of magnitude lower than
previous implementations on this task. We show that our system is particularly
well-suited for realistic channel equalisation by testing it on a drifting and
a switching channels and obtaining good performances
"
762,Embodiment of Learning in Electro-Optical Signal Processors,"  Delay-coupled electro-optical systems have received much attention for their
dynamical properties and their potential use in signal processing. In
particular it has recently been demonstrated, using the artificial intelligence
algorithm known as reservoir computing, that photonic implementations of such
systems solve complex tasks such as speech recognition. Here we show how the
backpropagation algorithm can be physically implemented on the same
electro-optical delay-coupled architecture used for computation with only minor
changes to the original design. We find that, compared when the backpropagation
algorithm is not used, the error rate of the resulting computing device,
evaluated on three benchmark tasks, decreases considerably. This demonstrates
that electro-optical analog computers can embody a large part of their own
training process, allowing them to be applied to new, more difficult tasks.
"
763,"A Quantum Cellular Automata architecture with nearest neighbor
  interactions using one quantum gate type","  We propose an architecture based on Quantum cellular Automata which allows
the use of only one type of quantum gates per computational step in order to
perform nearest neighbor interactions. The model is built in partial steps,
each one of them analyzed using nearest neighbor interactions, starting with
single qubit operations and continuing with two qubit ones. The effectiveness
of the model is tested and valuated by developing a quantum circuit
implementing the Quantum Fourier Transform. The important outcome of this
validation was that the operations are performed in a local and controlled
manner thus reducing the error rate of each computational step.

764,"Molecular solutions for the Maximum K-colourable Sub graph Problem in
  Adleman-Lipton model","  Adleman showed that deoxyribonucleic acid DNA strands could be employed
towards calculating solutions to an instance of the Hamiltonian path problem .
Lipton also demonstrated that Adleman techniques could be used to solve the
Satisfiability problem. In this paper, we use Adleman Lipton model for
developing a DNA algorithm to solve Maximum k-colourable Sub graph problem. In
spite of the NP-hardness of Maximum k-colourable Sub graph problem our DNA
procedures is done in a polynomial time.
"
765,A Mathematical Model for Fingerprinting-based Localization Algorithms,"  A general theoretical framework for Fingerprinting Localization Algorithms
(FPS), given their popularity, can be utilized for their performance studies.
In this work, after setting up an abstract model for FPS, it is shown that
fingerprinting-based localization problem can be cast as a hypothesis testing
(HT) problem and therefore various results in HT literature can be used to
provide insights, guidelines and performance bounds for general FPS. This
framework results in characterization of scaling limits of localization
reliability in terms of number of measurements and other environmental
parameters. It is suggested that Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between
probability distributions of selected feature for fingerprinting at different
locations encapsulates information about both accuracy and latency and can be
used as a central performance metric for studying FPS. Although developed for
an arbitrary fingerprint, the framework is particularly used for studying
simple Received Signal Strength (RSS)- based algorithm. The effect of various
parameters on the performance of fingerprinting algorithms is discussed, which
includes path loss and fading characteristics, number of measurements at each
point, number of anchors and their position, and placement of training points.
Representative simulations and experimentation are used to verify validity of
the theoretical frameworks in realistic setups.
"
766,"Neural-like computing with populations of superparamagnetic basis
  functions","  In neuroscience, population coding theory demonstrates that neural assemblies
can achieve fault-tolerant information processing. Mapped to nanoelectronics,
this strategy could allow for reliable computing with scaled-down, noisy,
imperfect devices. Doing so requires that the population components form a set
of basis functions in terms of their response functions to inputs, offering a
physical substrate for calculating. For this purpose, the responses of the
nanodevices should be non-linear, and each tuned to different values of the
input. These strong requirements have prevented a demonstration of population
coding with nanodevices. Here, we show that nanoscale magnetic tunnel junctions
can be assembled to meet these requirements. We demonstrate experimentally that
a population of nine junctions can implement a basis set of functions,
providing the data to achieve, for example, the generation of cursive letters.
We design hybrid magnetic-CMOS systems based on interlinked populations of
junctions and show that they can learn to realize non-linear
variability-resilient transformations with a low imprint area and low power.
"
767,"Design of an Ultra-Efficient Reversible Full Adder-Subtractor in
  Quantum-dot Cellular Automata","  By the progressive scaling of the feature size and power consumption in VLSI
chips the part of energy dissipated due to information loss in irreversible
computations will become a serious limitation in the near future. Quantum-dot
cellular automata (QCA) is an emerging nanotechnology with extremely low energy
dissipation which facilitates new computation paradigms such as reversible
computing. In this paper a novel reversible full adder-subtractor circuit based
on QCA is proposed. Our proposed design is implemented using only one layer and
does not require any rotated cells which significantly improves the
manufacturability of the design. In addition, it improves the cell count, area

768,"Rapid Prototyping of a Text Mining Application for Cryptocurrency Market
  Intelligence","  Blockchain represents a technology for establishing a shared, immutable
version of the truth between a network of participants that do not trust one
another, and therefore has the potential to disrupt any financial or other
industries that rely on third-parties to establish trust. Recent trends in
computing including: prevalence of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS); easy
access to High Performance Computing (HPC i.e. 'The Cloud'); and increasingly
advanced analytics capabilities such as Natural Language Processing (NLP) and
Machine Learning (ML) allow for rapidly prototyping applications for analysis
of trends in the emergence of Blockchain technology. A scaleable
proof-of-concept pipeline that lays the groundwork for analysis of multiple
streams of semi-structured data posted on social media is demonstrated.
Preliminary analysis and performance metrics are presented and discussed.
Future work is described that will scale the system to cloud-based, real-time,
analysis of multiple data streams, with Information Extraction (IE) (ex.
sentiment analysis) and Machine Learning capability.

769,"Finite generating sets for reversible gate sets under general
  conservation laws","  It is well-known that the Toffoli gate and the negation gate together yield a
universal gate set, in the sense that every permutation of $\{0,1\}^n$ can be
implemented as a composition of these gates. Since every bit operation that
does not use all of the bits performs an even permutation, we need to use at
least one auxiliary bit to perform every permutation, and it is known that one
bit is indeed enough. Without auxiliary bits, all even permutations can be
implemented. We generalize these results to non-binary logic: For any finite
set $A$, a finite gate set can generate all even permutations of $A^n$ for all
$n$, without any auxiliary symbols. This directly implies the previously
published result that a finite gate set can generate all permutations of $A^n$
when the cardinality of $A$ is odd, and that one auxiliary symbol is necessary
and sufficient to obtain all permutations when the cardinality of $A$ is even.
We also consider the conservative case, that is, those permutations of $A^n$
that preserve the weight of the input word. The weight is the vector that
records how many times each symbol occurs in the word or, more generally, the
image of the word under a fixed monoid homomorphism from $A^*$ to a commutative
monoid. It turns out that no finite conservative gate set can, for all $n$,
implement all conservative even permutations of $A^n$ without auxiliary bits.
But we provide a finite gate set that can implement all those conservative
permutations that are even within each weight class of $A^n$.

771,A Memristor Crossbar-Based Computation Scheme with High Precision,"  The memristor is promising to be the basic cell of next-generation
computation systems. Compared to the traditional MOSFET device, the memristor
is efficient over energy and area. But one of the biggest challenges faced with
researchers is how to program a memristor's resistance precisely. Recently, an
algorithm designed to save 8 valid bits in each memristor is proposed, but this
is still not sufficient for precise computation. In this paper, we propose a
crossbar-based memristor computation scheme supporting precise computations
whose operands have 32 valid bits. As a brief introduction, in a multiplication
with two operands, one operand is programmed as input signal, and the other
operand is saved into a so-called crossbar structure, which contains a group of
memristors, and each memristor saves several valid bits, usually one or two
bits only. The computation results,i.e. the multiplication of the two operands,
are contained in the outputs of the crossbar structure together with noise.
Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs) are then used to extract the valid bits,
which are the most significant bits of outputs. These valid bits can be
combined together with Digital-to-Analog Converters(DACs) to get the final
results. What's more, the precision of this computation scheme can be adjusted
according to the definition of the user, 32 valid bits at most, so it is
qualified for different application contexts.

772,"Temperature-Insensitive Analog Vector-by-Matrix Multiplier Based on 55
  nm NOR Flash Memory Cells","  We have fabricated and successfully tested an analog vector-by-matrix
multiplier, based on redesigned 10x12 arrays of 55 nm commercial NOR flash
memory cells. The modified arrays enable high-precision individual analog
tuning of each cell, with sub-1% accuracy, while keeping the highly optimized
cells, with their long-term state retention, intact. The array has an area of
0.33 um^2 per cell, and is at least one order of magnitude more dense than the
reported prior implementations of nonvolatile analog memories. The demonstrated
vector-by-vector multiplier, using gate coupling to additional periphery cells,
has ~2% precision, limited by the aggregate effect of cell noise, retention,
mismatch, process variations, tuning precision, and capacitive crosstalk. A
differential version of the multiplier has allowed us to demonstrate sub-3%
temperature drift of the output signal in the range between 25C and 85C.

773,Signal Processing with Pulse Trains: An Algebraic Approach- Part I,"  Recently we have shown that it is possible to represent continuous amplitude,
continuous time, band limited signals with an error as small as desired using
pulse trains via the integrate and fire converter (IFC). The IFC is an ultra
low power converter and processing with pulse trains is compatible with the
trends in the silicon technology for very low supply voltages. This paper
presents the definition of addition in pulse trains created by the IFC using
exclusively timing information, and proofs that it constitutes an Abelian group
in the space of IFC pulse trains. We also show that pulse domain addition
corresponds to pointwise addition of analog signals.
"
774,Signal Processing with Pulse Trains: An Algebraic Approach- Part II,"  The integrate and fire converter (IFC) enables an alternative to digital
signal processing. IFC converts analog signal voltages into time between pulses
and it is possible to reconstruct the analog signal from the IFC pulses with an
error as small as required. In this paper, we present the definition of
multiplication in pulse trains created by the IFC based on time domain
operations and prove that it constitutes an Abelian group in the space of IFC
pulse trains. We also show that pulse domain multiplication corresponds to
pointwise multiplication of analog signals. It is further proved that pulse
domain multiplication is distributive over pulse domain addition and hence it
forms a field in the space of IFC pulse trains, which is an important property
for linear signal processing.

775,"TiO$_2$-based Memristors and ReRAM: Materials, Mechanisms and Models (a
  Review)","  The memristor is the fundamental non-linear circuit element, with uses in
computing and computer memory. ReRAM (Resistive Random Access Memory) is a
resistive switching memory proposed as a non-volatile memory. In this review we
shall summarise the state of the art for these closely-related fields,
concentrating on titanium dioxide, the well-utilised and archetypal material
for both. We shall cover material properties, switching mechanisms and models
to demonstrate what ReRAM and memristor scientists can learn from each other
and examine the outlook for these technologies.

776,"Advancing Memristive Analog Neuromorphic Networks: Increasing
  Complexity, and Coping with Imperfect Hardware Components","  We experimentally demonstrate classification of 4x4 binary images into 4
classes, using a 3-layer mixed-signal neuromorphic network (""MLP perceptron""),
based on two passive 20x20 memristive crossbar arrays, board-integrated with
discrete CMOS components. The network features 10 hidden-layer and 4
output-layer analog CMOS neurons and 428 metal-oxide memristors, i.e. is almost
an order of magnitude more complex than any previously reported functional
memristor circuit. Moreover, the inference operation of this classifier is
performed entirely in the integrated hardware. To deal with larger crossbar
arrays, we have developed a semi-automatic approach to their forming and
testing, and compared several memristor training schemes for coping with
imperfect behavior of these devices, as well as with variability of analog CMOS
neurons. The effectiveness of the proposed schemes for defect and variation
tolerance was verified experimentally using the implemented network and,
additionally, by modeling the operation of a larger network, with 300
hidden-layer neurons, on the MNIST benchmark. Finally, we propose a simple
modification of the implemented memristor-based vector-by-matrix multiplier to
allow its operation in a wider temperature range.

777,"A Physical Unclonable Function with Redox-based Nanoionic Resistive
  Memory","  A unique set of characteristics are packed in emerging nonvolatile
reduction-oxidation (redox)-based resistive switching memories (ReRAMs) such as
their underlying stochastic switching processes alongside their intrinsic
highly nonlinear current-voltage characteristic, which in addition to known
nano-fabrication process variation make them a promising candidate for the next
generation of low-cost, low-power, tiny and secure Physically Unclonable
Functions (PUFs). This paper takes advantage of this otherwise disadvantageous
ReRAM feature using a combination of novel architectural and peripheral
circuitry. We present a physical one-way function, nonlinear resistive Physical
Unclonable Function (nrPUF), potentially applicable in variety of
cyber-physical security applications given its performance characteristics. We
experimentally verified performance of Valency Change Mechanism (VCM)-based
ReRAM in nano-fabricated crossbar arrays across multiple dies and runs. In
addition to a massive pool of Challenge-Response Pairs (CRPs), using a
combination of experimental and simulation, our proposed PUF shows a
reliability of 98.67%, a uniqueness of 49.85%, a diffuseness of 49.86%, a

"
778,Logic Gates with Ion Transistors,"  Electronic logic gates are the basic building blocks of every computing and
micro controlling system. Logic gates are made of switches, such as diodes and
transistors. Ion-selective, ionic switches may emulate electronic switches
[1-8]. If we ever want to create artificial bio-chemical circuitry, then we
need to move a step further towards ion-logic circuitry. Here we demonstrate
ion XOR and OR gates with electrochemical cells, and specifically, with two
wet-cell batteries. In parallel to vacuum tubes, the batteries were modified to
include a third, permeable and conductive mid electrode (the gate), which was
placed between the anode and cathode in order to affect the ion flow through
it. The key is to control the cell output with a much smaller biasing power, as
demonstrated here. A successful demonstration points to self-powered ion logic
gates.
"
779,Non-ideal memristors for a non-ideal world,"  Memristors have pinched hysteresis loops in the $V-I$ plane. Ideal memristors
are everywhere non-linear, cross at zero and are rotationally symmetric. In
this paper we extend memristor theory to produce different types of
non-ideality and find that: including a background current (such as an ionic
current) moves the crossing point away from zero; including a degradation
resistance (that increases with experimental time) leads to an asymmetry;
modelling a low resistance filament in parallel describes triangular $V-I$
curves with a straight-line low resistance state. A novel measurement of
hysteresis asymmetry was introduced based on hysteresis and it was found that
which lobe was bigger depended on the size of the breaking current relative to
the memristance. The hysteresis varied differently with each type of
non-ideality, suggesting that measurements of several device I-V curves and
calculation of these parameters could give an indication of the underlying
mechanism.

780,"A Machine Learning Approach to Model the Received Signal in Molecular
  Communications","  A molecular communication channel is determined by the received signal.
Received signal models form the basis for studies focused on modulation,
receiver design, capacity, and coding depend on the received signal models.
Therefore, it is crucial to model the number of received molecules until time
$t$ analytically. Modeling the diffusion-based molecular communication channel
with the first-hitting process is an open issue for a spherical transmitter. In
this paper, we utilize the artificial neural networks technique to model the
received signal for a spherical transmitter and a perfectly absorbing receiver
(i.e., first hitting process). The proposed technique may be utilized in other
studies that assume a spherical transmitter instead of a point transmitter.
"
781,"Improving the Coverage and Spectral Efficiency of Millimeter-Wave
  Cellular Networks using Device-to-Device Relays","  The susceptibility of millimeter waveform propagation to blockages limits the
coverage of millimeter-wave (mmWave) signals. To overcome blockages, we propose
to leverage two-hop device-to-device (D2D) relaying. Using stochastic geometry,
we derive expressions for the downlink coverage probability of relay-assisted
mmWave cellular networks when the D2D links are implemented in either uplink
mmWave or uplink microwave bands. We further investigate the spectral
efficiency (SE) improvement in the cellular downlink, and the effect of D2D
transmissions on the cellular uplink. For mmWave links, we derive the coverage
probability using dominant interferer analysis while accounting for both
blockages and beamforming gains. For microwave D2D links, we derive the
coverage probability considering both line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight
(NLOS) propagation. Numerical results show that downlink coverage and SE can be
improved using two-hop D2D relaying. Specifically, microwave D2D relays achieve
better coverage because D2D connections can be established under NLOS
conditions. However, mmWave D2D relays achieve better coverage when the density
of interferers is large because blockages eliminate interference from NLOS
interferers. The SE on the downlink depends on the relay mode selection
strategy, and mmWave D2D relays use a significantly smaller fraction of uplink
resources than microwave D2D relays.

782,MESL: Proposal for a Non-volatile Cascadable Magneto-Electric Spin Logic,"  In the quest for novel, scalable and energy-efficient computing technologies,
many non-charge based logic devices are being explored. Recent advances in
multi-ferroic materials have paved the way for electric field induced low
energy and fast switching of nano-magnets using the magneto-electric (ME)
effect. In this paper, we propose a voltage driven logic-device based on the ME
induced switching of nano-magnets. We further demonstrate that the proposed
logic-device, which exhibits decoupled read and write paths, can be used to
construct a complete logic family including XNOR, NAND and NOR gates. The
proposed logic family shows good scalability with a quadratic dependence of
switching energy with respect to the switching voltage. Further, the proposed
logic-device has better robustness against the effect of thermal noise as
compared to the conventional current driven switching of nano-magnets. A
device-to-circuit level coupled simulation framework, including magnetization
dynamics and electron transport model, has been developed for analyzing the
present proposal. Using our simulation framework, we present energy and delay
results for the proposed Magneto-Electric Spin Logic (MESL) gates.

783,"Highly-Secure Physically Unclonable Cryptographic Primitives Using
  Nonlinear Conductance and Analog State Tuning in Memristive Crossbar Arrays","  The rapidly expanding hardware-intrinsic security primitives are aimed at
addressing significant security challenges of a massively interconnected world
in the age of information technology. The main idea of such primitives is to
employ instance-specific process-induced variations in electronic hardware as a
source of cryptographic data. Among the emergent technologies, memristive
devices provide unique opportunities for security applications due to the
underlying stochasticity in their operation. Herein, we report a prototype of a
robust, dense, and reconfigurable physical unclonable function primitives based
on the three-dimensional passive metal-oxide memristive crossbar circuits, by
making positive use of process-induced variations in the devices' nonlinear
I-Vs and their analog tuning. We first characterize security metrics for a
basic building block of the security primitives based on a two layer stack with
monolithically integrated 10x10 250-nm half-pitch memristive crossbar circuits.
The experimental results show that the average uniformity and diffusivity,
measured on a random sample of 6,000 64-bit responses, out of ~697,000 total,
is close to ideal 50% with 5% standard deviation for both metrics. The
uniqueness, which was evaluated on a smaller sample by readjusting conductances
of crosspoint devices within the same crossbar, is also close to the ideal 50%
+/- 1%, while the smallest bit error rate, i.e. reciprocal of reliability,
measured over 30-day window under +/-20% power supply variations, was ~ 1.5%
+/- 1%. We then utilize multiple instances of the basic block to demonstrate
physically unclonable functional primitive with 10-bit hidden challenge
generation that encodes more than 10^19 challenge response pairs and has
comparable uniformity, diffusiveness, and bit error rate.
"
784,Factoring using 2n+2 qubits with Toffoli based modular multiplication,"  We describe an implementation of Shor's quantum algorithm to factor n-bit
integers using only 2n+2 qubits. In contrast to previous space-optimized
implementations, ours features a purely Toffoli based modular multiplication
circuit. The circuit depth and the overall gate count are in O(n^3) and O(n^3
log(n)), respectively. We thus achieve the same space and time costs as
Takahashi et al., while using a purely classical modular multiplication
circuit. As a consequence, our approach evades most of the cost overheads
originating from rotation synthesis and enables testing and localization of
faults in both, the logical level circuit and an actual quantum hardware
implementation. Our new (in-place) constant-adder, which is used to construct
the modular multiplication circuit, uses only dirty ancilla qubits and features
a circuit size and depth in O(n log(n)) and O(n), respectively.
"
785,"Computing with volatile memristors: An application of non-pinched
  hysteresis","  The possibility of in-memory computing with volatile memristive devices,
namely, memristors requiring a power source to sustain their memory, is
demonstrated. We have adopted a hysteretic graphene-based field emission
structure as a prototype of volatile memristor, which is characterized by a
non-pinched hysteresis loop. Memristive model of the structure is developed and
used to simulate a polymorphic circuit implementing in-memory computing gates
such as the material implication. Specific regions of parameter space realizing
useful logic functions are identified. Our results are applicable to other
realizations of volatile memory devices.
"
786,"Sub 100nW volatile nano-metal-oxide memristor as synaptic-like encoder
  of neuronal spikes","  Advanced neural interfaces mediate a bio-electronic link between the nervous
system and microelectronic devices, bearing great potential as innovative
therapy for various diseases. Spikes from a large number of neurons are
recorded leading to creation of big data that require on-line processing under
most stringent conditions, such as minimal power dissipation and on-chip space
occupancy. Here, we present a new concept where the inherent volatile
properties of a nano-scale memristive device are used to detect and compress
information on neural spikes as recorded by a multi-electrode array.
Simultaneously, and similarly to a biological synapse, information on spike
amplitude and frequency is transduced in metastable resistive state transitions
of the device, which is inherently capable of self-resetting and of continuous
encoding of spiking activity. Furthermore, operating the memristor in a very
high resistive state range reduces its average in-operando power dissipation to
less than 100 nW, demonstrating the potential to build highly scalable, yet
energy-efficient on-node processors for advanced neural interfaces.
"
787,CoMET: Composite-Input Magnetoelectric-based Logic Technology,"  This work proposes CoMET, a fast and energy-efficient spintronics device for
logic applications. An input voltage is applied to a ferroelectric (FE)
material, in contact with a composite structure - a ferromagnet (FM) with
in-plane magnetic anisotropy (IMA) placed on top of an intra-gate FM
interconnect with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA). Through the
magnetoelectric (ME) effect, the input voltage nucleates a domain wall (DW) at
the input end of the PMA-FM interconnect. An applied current then rapidly
propagates the DW towards the output FE structure, where the inverse-ME effect
generates an output voltage. This voltage is propagated to the input of the
next CoMET device using a novel circuit structure that enables efficient device
cascading. The material parameters for CoMET are optimized by systematically
exploring the impact of parameter choices on device performance. Simulations on
a 7nm CoMET device show fast, low-energy operation, with a delay/energy of
98ps/68aJ for INV and 135ps/85aJ for MAJ3.
"
788,"Two-Dimensional Oscillatory Neural Network Based on Charge-Density-Wave
  Devices Operating at Room Temperature","  We propose an oscillatory neural network implemented with two-dimensional
tantalum disulfide devices operating in the change density wave regime at room
temperature. An elementary cell of the network consists of two 1T-TaS2 devices
connected in series. Such a cell has constant output and oscillatory states.
All cells have the same bias voltage. There is constant current flowing through
the cell in the constant output mode. The oscillations occur at a certain bias
voltage due to the electrical-field driven metal-to-insulator transition owing
to the changes in the charge density wave phase in the 1T-TaS2 channel. Two
1T-TaS2 devices oscillate out-of-phase where one of the devices is in the
insulator phase while the other one is in the metallic state. The
nearest-neighbor cells are coupled via graphene transistors. The cells are
resistively coupled if the graphene transistor is in the On state while they
are capacitively coupled if the transistor is in the Off state. The operation
of the oscillatory neural network is simulated numerically for the 30x30 node
network. The results of our numerical modeling show the formation of artificial
vortexes and cellular-automata type data processing. The two-dimensional
1T-TaS2 devices, utilized in the network, offer a unique combination of
properties such as scalability, high operational frequency, fast
synchronization speed, and radiation hardness, which makes them promising for
both consumer electronic and defense applications.

789,Simulating with AcCoRD: Actor-Based Communication via Reaction-Diffusion,"  This paper introduces AcCoRD (Actor-based Communication via
Reaction-Diffusion) version 1.0. AcCoRD is a sandbox reaction-diffusion solver
designed for the study of molecular communication systems. It uses a hybrid of
microscopic and mesoscopic simulation models that enables scalability via user
control of local accuracy. AcCoRD is developed in C as an open source command
line tool and includes utilities to process simulation output in MATLAB. The
latest code and links to user documentation can be found at
https://github.com/adamjgnoel/AcCoRD/. This paper provides an overview of
AcCoRD's design, including the motivation for developing a specialized
reaction-diffusion solver. The corresponding algorithms are presented in
detail, including the computational complexity of the microscopic and
mesoscopic models. Other novel derivations include the transition rates between
adjacent mesoscopic subvolumes of different sizes. Simulation results
demonstrate the use of AcCoRD as both an accurate reaction-diffusion solver and
one that is catered to the analysis of molecular communication systems. A link
is included to videos that demonstrate many of the simulated scenarios.
Additional insights from the simulation results include the selection of
suitable hybrid model parameters, the impact of reactive surfaces that are in
the proximity of a hybrid interface, and the size of a bounded environment that
is necessary to assume that it is unbounded. The development of AcCoRD is
ongoing, so its future direction is also discussed in order to highlight
improvements that will expand its potential areas of application. New features
that are being planned at the time of writing include a fluid flow model and
more complex actor behavior.
"
790,Design Automation and Design Space Exploration for Quantum Computers,"  A major hurdle to the deployment of quantum linear systems algorithms and
recent quantum simulation algorithms lies in the difficulty to find inexpensive
reversible circuits for arithmetic using existing hand coded methods. Motivated
by recent advances in reversible logic synthesis, we synthesize arithmetic
circuits using classical design automation flows and tools. The combination of
classical and reversible logic synthesis enables the automatic design of large
components in reversible logic starting from well-known hardware description
languages such as Verilog. As a prototype example for our approach we
automatically generate high quality networks for the reciprocal $1/x$, which is
necessary for quantum linear systems algorithms.

791,"Analysis and Design of a Passive Switched-Capacitor Matrix Multiplier
  for Approximate Computing","  A switched-capacitor matrix multiplier is presented for approximate computing
and machine learning applications. The multiply-and-accumulate operations
perform discrete-time charge-domain signal processing using passive switches
and 300 aF unit capacitors. The computation is digitized with a 6 b
asynchronous successive approximation register analog-to-digital converter. The
analyses of incomplete charge accumulation and thermal noise are discussed. The
design was fabricated in 40 nm CMOS, and experimental measurements of
multiplication are illustrated using matched filtering and image convolutions
to analyze noise and offset. Two applications are highlighted: 1)
energy-efficient feature extraction layer performing both compression and
classification in a neural network for an analog front end and 2) analog
acceleration for solving optimization problems that are traditionally performed
in the digital domain. The chip obtains measured efficiencies of 8.7 TOPS/W at
1 GHz for the first application and 7.7 TOPS/W at 2.5 GHz for the second
application.

792,"Enabling Bio-Plausible Multi-level STDP using CMOS Neurons with
  Dendrites and Bistable RRAMs","  Large-scale integration of emerging nanoscale non-volatile memory devices,
e.g. resistive random-access memory (RRAM), can enable a new generation of
neuromorphic computers that can solve a wide range of machine learning
problems. Such hybrid CMOS-RRAM neuromorphic architectures will result in
several orders of magnitude reduction in energy consumption at a very small
form factor, and herald autonomous learning machines capable of self-adapting
to their environment. However, the progress in this area has been impeded from
the realization that the actual memory devices fall well short of their
expected behavior. In this work, we discuss the challenges associated with
these memory devices and their use in neuromorphic computing circuits, and
propose pathways to overcome these limitations by introducing 'dendritic
learning'.
"
793,"High-Bandwidth and Large Coupling Tolerance Graded-Index Multimode
  Polymer Waveguides for On-board High-Speed Optical Interconnects","  Optical interconnects have attracted significant research interest for use in
short-reach board-level optical communication links in supercomputers and data
centres. Multimode polymer waveguides in particular constitute an attractive
technology for on-board optical interconnects as they provide high bandwidth,
offer relaxed alignment tolerances, and can be cost-effectively integrated onto
standard printed circuit boards (PCBs). However, the continuing improvements in
bandwidth performance of optical sources make it important to investigate
approaches to develop high bandwidth polymer waveguides. In this paper, we
present dispersion studies on a graded-index (GI) waveguide in siloxane
materials designed to deliver high bandwidth over a range of launch conditions.
Bandwidth-length products of >70 GHzxm and ~65 GHzxm are observed using a
50/125 um multimode fibre (MMF) launch for input offsets of +/- 10 um without
and with the use of a mode mixer respectively; and enhanced values of >100
GHzxm are found under a 10x microscope objective launch for input offsets of
~18 x 20 um^2. The large range of offsets is within the -1 dB alignment
tolerances. A theoretical model is developed using the measured refractive
index profile of the waveguide, and general agreement is found with
experimental bandwidth measurements. The reported results clearly demonstrate
the potential of this technology for use in high-speed board-level optical
links, and indicate that data transmission of 100 Gb/s over a multimode polymer
waveguide is feasible with appropriate refractive index engineering.

794,Memristor Threshold Logic: An Overview to Challenges and Applications,"  Once referred to as the missing circuit component, memristor has come long
way across to be recognized and taken as important to future circuit designs.
The memristor due to its ability to memorize the state, switch between
different resistance level, smaller size and low leakage currents makes it
useful for a wide range of intelligent memory and computing applications. This
overview paper highlights broadly provides the uses of memristor in the
implementation of cognitive cells for different imaging and pattern matching
applications.

795,Non-volatile spin wave majority gate at the nanoscale,"  A spin wave majority fork-like structure with feature size of 40\,nm, is
presented and investigated, through micromagnetic simulations. The structure
consists of three merging out-of-plane magnetization spin wave buses and four
magneto-electric cells serving as three inputs and an output. The information
of the logic signals is encoded in the phase of the transmitted spin waves and
subsequently stored as direction of magnetization of the magneto-electric cells
upon detection. The minimum dimensions of the structure that produce an
operational majority gate are identified. For all input combinations, the
detection scheme employed manages to capture the majority phase result of the
spin wave interference and ignore all reflection effects induced by the
geometry of the structure.
"
796,"A Universal Multi-Hierarchy Figure-of-Merit for On-Chip Computing and
  Communications","  Continuing demands for increased compute efficiency and communication
bandwidth have led to the development of novel interconnect technologies with
the potential to outperform conventional electrical interconnects. With a
plurality of interconnect technologies to include electronics, photonics,
plasmonics, and hybrids thereof, the simple approach of counting on-chip
devices to capture performance is insufficient. While some efforts have been
made to capture the performance evolution more accurately, they eventually
deviate from the observed development pace. Thus, a holistic figure of merit
(FOM) is needed to adequately compare these recent technology paradigms. Here
we introduce the Capability-to-Latency-Energy-Amount-Resistance (CLEAR) FOM
derived from device and link performance criteria of both active optoelectronic
devices and passive components alike. As such CLEAR incorporates communication
delay, energy efficiency, on-chip scaling and economic cost. We show that CLEAR
accurately describes compute development including most recent machines. Since
this FOM is derived bottom-up, we demonstrate remarkable adaptability to
applications ranging from device-level to network and system-level. Applying
CLEAR to benchmark device, link, and network performance against fundamental
physical compute and communication limits shows that photonics is competitive
even for fractions of the die-size, thus making a case for on-chip optical
interconnects.
"
797,Moore's Law in CLEAR Light,"  The inability of Moore's Law and other figure-of-merits (FOMs) to accurately
explain the technology development of the semiconductor industry demands a
holistic merit to guide the industry. Here we introduce a FOM termed CLEAR that
accurately postdicts technology developments since the 1940's until today, and
predicts photonics as a logical extension to keep-up the pace of
information-handling machines. We show that CLEAR
(Capability-to-Latency-Energy-Amount-Resistance) is multi-hierarchical applying
to the device, interconnect, and system level. Being a holistic FOM, we show
that empirical trends such as Moore's Law and the Makimoto's wave are special
cases of the universal CLEAR merit. Looking ahead, photonic board- and
chip-level technologies are able to continue the observed doubling rate of the
CLEAR value every 12 months, while electronic technologies are unable to keep
pace.
"
798,Field-Programmable Crossbar Array (FPCA) for Reconfigurable Computing,"  For decades, advances in electronics were directly driven by the scaling of
CMOS transistors according to Moore's law. However, both the CMOS scaling and
the classical computer architecture are approaching fundamental and practical
limits, and new computing architectures based on emerging devices, such as
resistive random-access memory (RRAM) devices, are expected to sustain the
exponential growth of computing capability. Here we propose a novel
memory-centric, reconfigurable, general purpose computing platform that is
capable of handling the explosive amount of data in a fast and energy-efficient
manner. The proposed computing architecture is based on a uniform, physical,
resistive, memory-centric fabric that can be optimally reconfigured and
utilized to perform different computing and data storage tasks in a massively
parallel approach. The system can be tailored to achieve maximal energy
efficiency based on the data flow by dynamically allocating the basic computing
fabric for storage, arithmetic, and analog computing including neuromorphic
computing tasks.
"
799,On Fault-Tolerant Design of Exclusive-OR Gates in QCA,"  Design paradigms of logic circuits with Quantum-dot Cellular Automata (QCA)
have been extensively studied in the recent past. Unfortunately, due to the
lack of mature fabrication support, QCA-based circuits often suffer from
various types of manufacturing defects and variations, and therefore, are
unreliable and error-prone. QCA-based Exclusive-OR (XOR) gates are frequently
used in the construction of several computing subsystems such as adders, linear
feedback shift registers, parity generators and checkers. However, none of the
existing designs for QCA XOR gates have considered the issue of ensuring
fault-tolerance. Simulation results also show that these designs can hardly
tolerate any fault. We investigate the applicability of various existing
fault-tolerant schemes such as triple modular redundancy (TMR), NAND
multiplexing, and majority multiplexing in the context of practical realization
of QCA XOR gate. Our investigations reveal that these techniques incur
prohibitively large area and delay and hence, they are unsuitable for practical
scenarios. We propose here realistic designs of QCA XOR gates (in terms of area
and delay) with significantly high fault-tolerance against all types of cell
misplacement defects such as cell omission, cell displacement, cell
misalignment and extra/additional cell deposition. Furthermore, the absence of
any crossing in the proposed designs facilitates low-cost fabrication of such
systems.

800,"An Energy-Efficient VCO-Based Matrix Multiplier Block to Support On-Chip
  Image Analysis","  Images typically are represented as uniformly sampled data in the form of
matrix of pixels/voxels. Therefore, matrix multiply-and-accumulate (MAC) forms
the core of most state-of-the-art image analysis algorithms. While digital
implementation of MAC has generally been the preferred approach, high power
consumption is an impediment to adopting it for medical image analysis. In this
work, we present a time-domain signal processing architecture which performs
MAC operations with 7bit accuracy while consuming 400X lower energy than
digital implementation. The proposed architecture performs analog computation
using mostly digital circuits and is suitable for scaled CMOS technologies. The
proposed time-domain MAC architecture is expected to play a central role in
empowering the advancement of various on-chip image analysis operations.

801,Memcomputing Numerical Inversion with Self-Organizing Logic Gates,"  We propose to use Digital Memcomputing Machines (DMMs), implemented with
self-organizing logic gates (SOLGs), to solve the problem of numerical
inversion. Starting from fixed-point scalar inversion we describe the
generalization to solving linear systems and matrix inversion. This method,
when realized in hardware, will output the result in only one computational
step. As an example, we perform simulations of the scalar case using a 5-bit
logic circuit made of SOLGs, and show that the circuit successfully performs
the inversion. Our method can be extended efficiently to any level of
precision, since we prove that producing n-bit precision in the output requires
extending the circuit by at most n bits. This type of numerical inversion can
be implemented by DMM units in hardware, it is scalable, and thus of great
benefit to any real-time computing application.

802,"A modified Physarum-inspired model for the user equilibrium traffic
  assignment problem","  The user equilibrium traffic assignment principle is very important in the
traffic assignment problem. Mathematical programming models are designed to
solve the user equilibrium problem in traditional algorithms. Recently, the
Physarum shows the ability to address the user equilibrium and system
optimization traffic assignment problems. However, the Physarum model are not
efficient in real traffic networks with two-way traffic characteristics and
multiple origin-destination pairs. In this article, a modified
Physarum-inspired model for the user equilibrium problem is proposed. By
decomposing traffic flux based on origin nodes, the traffic flux from different
origin-destination pairs can be distinguished in the proposed model. The
Physarum can obtain the equilibrium traffic flux when no shorter path can be
discovered between each origin-destination pair. Finally, numerical examples
use the Sioux Falls network to demonstrate the rationality and convergence
properties of the proposed model.

803,"Radio Frequency Modulated Signaling Interconnect for Memory-to-Processor
  and Processor-to-Processor Interfaces: An Overview","  With the evolution of heterogeneous computing system, such as
network-on-chip, high-performance distributed computing, accelerator-rich
architectures and cluster computing, high-speed, energy-efficient and
low-latency interfaces among memory-to-processor and processor-to-processor
become the key technology to enable those technologies. Simultaneously, the
scaling of CMOS makes the switching speed of the transistor up to sub-THz.
Radio-frequency or even millimeter-wave modulated signaling interconnect has
unique features in ultra-low power operation, dynamic allocation of bandwidth
and low latency, compared with convention baseband signaling interconnect. In
this work, we overview the different generations of radio-frequency
interconnect (RF-I) technology, compare them with conventional baseband
signaling interconnect technologies. The limitations and potentials are also
discussed in the end.
"
804,Experimental prototype of a spin-wave majority gate,"  Featuring low heat dissipation, devices based on spin-wave logic gates
promise to comply with increasing future requirements in information
processing. In this work, we present the experimental realization of a majority
gate based on the interference of spin waves in an Yttrium-Iron-Garnet-based
waveguiding structure. This logic device features a three-input combiner with
the logic information encoded in the phase of the spin waves. We show that the
phase of the output signal represents the majority of the phase of the input
signals. A switching time of about 10 ns in the prototype device provides
evidence for the ability of sub-nanosecond data processing in future
down-scaled devices.
"
805,"MRFI Stream Arbitration: An Efficient Arbitration Scheme for NoC with
  Emerging Interconnect Technology","  An improved version of stream arbitration based on multiband RF interconnect
(MRFI) is proposed. Thanks to the simultaneous multiple channel
transmitting/receiving feature of MRFI, dynamic bandwidth allocation is
achieved in the proposed arbitration algorithm. With dynamic bandwidth
allocation, MRFI based arbitration can guarantee 100% channel bandwidth
utilization, which is a significant improvement compared with original RF-I
based stream arbitration whose channel bandwidth utilization is only around
30%~50%.
"
806,Error tracing in linear and concatenated quantum circuits,"  Descriptions of quantum algorithms, communication etc. protocols assume the
existence of closed quantum system. However, real life quantum systems are open
and are highly sensitive to errors. Hence error correction is of utmost
importance if quantum computation is to be carried out in reality. Ideally, an
error correction block should be placed after every gate operation in a quantum
circuit. This increases the overhead and reduced the speedup of the quantum
circuit. Moreover, the error correction blocks themselves may induce errors as
the gates used for error correction may be noisy. In this paper, we have
proposed a procedure to trace error probability due to noisy gates and
decoherence in quantum circuit and place an error correcting block only when
the error probability exceeds a certain threshold. This procedure shows a
drastic reduction in the required number of error correcting blocks.
Furthermore, we have considered concatenated codes with tile structure layout
lattice architecture[25][21],[24] and SWAP gate based qubit transport
mechanism. Tracing errors in higher levels of concatenation shows that, in most
cases, after 1 or 2 levels of concatenation, the number of QECC blocks required
become static. However, since the gate count increases with increasing
concatenation, the percentage saving in gate count is considerably high.
"
807,ProjectQ: An Open Source Software Framework for Quantum Computing,"  We introduce ProjectQ, an open source software effort for quantum computing.
The first release features a compiler framework capable of targeting various
types of hardware, a high-performance simulator with emulation capabilities,
and compiler plug-ins for circuit drawing and resource estimation. We introduce
our Python-embedded domain-specific language, present the features, and provide
example implementations for quantum algorithms. The framework allows testing of
quantum algorithms through simulation and enables running them on actual
quantum hardware using a back-end connecting to the IBM Quantum Experience
cloud service. Through extension mechanisms, users can provide back-ends to
further quantum hardware, and scientists working on quantum compilation can
provide plug-ins for additional compilation, optimization, gate synthesis, and
layout strategies.

808,An Overview of Mobile Capacitive Touch Technologies Trends,"  Touch sensing, as a major human/machine interface, is widely used in various
commercial products such as smart watches, mobile phones, tablets and TVs.
State-of-the-art touch detections are mainly based on mutual capacitive
sensing, which requires necessary contact-touch, limiting the mobile user
experience. Recently, remote gesture sensing is widely reported in both academy
and industry as it can provide additional user-experience for mobile interface.
The capacitive remote gesture sensing is mainly based on detecting
self-capacitance, achieving high resolution through eliminating the parasitic
mutual capacitance. In this work, we overview the different generations of
touchscreen technology, comparing the touch and remote gesture sensing
technologies difference. In addition, different remote gesture sensing
technologies are also compared. The limitations and potentials of different
topologies are discussed and a final conclusion about the technology trends is
summarized in the end.
"
809,"Fredkin and Toffoli gates implemented in Oregonator model of
  Belousov-Zhabotinsky medium","  A thin-layer Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) medium is a powerful computing device
capable for implementing logical circuits, memory, image processors, robot
controllers, and neuromorphic architectures. We design the reversible logical
gates --- Fredkin gate and Toffoli gate --- in a BZ medium network of excitable
channels with sub-excitable junctions. Local control of the BZ medium
excitability is an important feature of the gates' design. A excitable
thin-layer BZ medium responds to a localised perturbation with omnidirectional
target or spiral excitation waves. A sub-excitable BZ medium responds to an
asymmetric perturbation by producing travelling localised excitation
wave-fragments similar to dissipative solitons. We employ interactions between
excitation wave-fragments to perform computation. We interpret the
wave-fragments as values of Boolean variables. A presence of a wave-fragment at
a given site of a circuit represents logical truth, absence of the
wave-fragment --- logical false. Fredkin gate consists of ten excitable
channels intersecting at eleven junctions eight of which are sub-excitable.
Toffoli gate consists of six excitable channels intersecting at six junctions
four of which are sub-excitable. The designs of the gates are verified using
numerical integration of two-variable Oregonator equations.
"
810,"Parallel photonic reservoir computing using frequency multiplexing of
  neurons","  Today's unrelenting increase in demand for information processing creates the
need for novel computing concepts. Reservoir computing is such a concept that
lends itself particularly well to photonic hardware implementations. Over
recent years, these hardware implementations have gained maturity and now
achieve state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark tasks. However,
implementations so far are essentially all based on sequential data processing,
leaving the inherent parallelism of photonics unexploited. Parallel
implementations process all neurons simultaneously, and therefore have the
potential of reducing computation time by a factor equal to the number of
neurons, compared to sequential architectures. Here, we report a parallel
reservoir computer that uses frequency domain multiplexing of neuron states. We
illustrate its performance on standard benchmark tasks such as nonlinear
channel equalization, the reproduction of a nonlinear 10th-order system, and
speech recognition, obtaining error rates similar to previous optical
experiments. The present experiment is thus an important step towards high
speed, low footprint, all optical photonic information processing.
"
811,Evaluating Ternary Adders using a hybrid Memristor / CMOS approach,"  This paper investigates the potentials of using a hybrid memristor CMOS
technology, called MeMOS, for the realisation of ternary adders. Ternary adders
exploit the qualitative advantage of multi-value storage capability of
memristors compared to conventional CMOS flip-flops storing only binary values
in one cell. Furthermore they carry out an addition in $O(1)$ and are therefore
considered. The MeMOS approach is compared to a CMOS solution for the ternary
adders using multi value memristors as registers concerning the achievable
latency and the energy consumption. It is shown that using the TEAM, VTEAM
model and a model considering commercially available memristors from Known the
approach of using CMOS ternary adders using memristors as multi-value register
memory is to prefer. MeMOS circuits have advantages for a static operation
mode, i.e. if they are operated after a reset.
"
812,A Finite Presentation of CNOT-Dihedral Operators,"  We give a finite presentation by generators and relations of the unitary
operators expressible over the {CNOT, T, X} gate set, also known as
CNOT-dihedral operators. To this end, we introduce a notion of normal form for
CNOT-dihedral circuits and prove that every CNOT-dihedral operator admits a
unique normal form. Moreover, we show that in the presence of certain
structural rules only finitely many circuit identities are required to reduce
an arbitrary CNOT-dihedral circuit to its normal form.
  By appropriately restricting our relations, we obtain a finite presentation
of unitary operators expressible over the {CNOT, T} gate set as a corollary.
"
813,High Performance CNFET-based Ternary Full Adders,"  This paper investigates the use of carbon nanotube field effect transistors
(CNFETs) for the design of ternary full adder cells. The proposed circuits have
been designed based on the unique properties of CNFETs such as having desired
threshold voltages by adjusting diameter of the CNFETs gate nanotubes. The
proposed circuits are examined using HSPICE simulator with the standard 32 nm
CNFET technology. The proposed methods are simulated at different conditions
such as different supply voltages, different temperature and operational
frequencies. Simulation results show that the proposed designs are faster than
the state of the art CNFET based ternary full adders.
"
814,"Complete DFM Model for High-Performance Computing SoCs with Guard Ring
  and Dummy Fill Effect","  For nanotechnology, the semiconductor device is scaled down dramatically with
additional strain engineering for device enhancement, the overall device
characteristic is no longer dominated by the device size but also circuit
layout. The higher order layout effects, such as well proximity effect (WPE),
oxide spacing effect (OSE) and poly spacing effect (PSE), play an important
role for the device performance, it is critical to understand Design for
Manufacturability (DFM) impacts with various layout topology toward the overall
circuit performance. Currently, the layout effects (WPE, OSE and PSE) are
validated through digital standard cell and analog differential pair test
structure. However, two analog layout structures: the guard ring and dummy fill
impact are not well studied yet, then, this paper describes the current mirror
test circuit to examine the guard ring and dummy fills DFM impacts using TSMC
28nm HPM process.
"
815,"Loss and Bandwidth Studies on Multimode Polymer Waveguide Components for
  On-Board High-Speed Optical Interconnects","  Optical interconnects play a key role in the implementation of high-speed
short-reach communication links within high-performance electronic systems.
Multimode polymer waveguides in particular are strong candidates for use in
passive optical backplanes as they can be cost-effectively integrated onto
standard PCBs. Various optical backplanes using this technology and featuring a
large number of multimode polymer waveguide components have been recently
demonstrated. The optimisation of the loss performance of these complex
waveguide layouts becomes particularly important at high data rates (>=25 Gb/s)
due to the associated stringent power budget requirements. Moreover, launch
conditions have to be carefully considered in such systems due to the
highly-multimoded nature of this waveguide technology. In this paper therefore,
we present thorough loss and bandwidth studies on siloxane-based multimode
waveguides and waveguide components (i.e. bends and crossings) that enable the
implementation of passive optical backplanes. The performance of these
components is experimentally investigated under different launch conditions for
different waveguide profiles that can be readily achieved through fabrication.
Useful design rules on the use of waveguide bends and crossings are derived for
each waveguide type. It is shown that the choice of waveguide parameters
depends on the particular waveguide layout, assumed launch conditions and
desired link bandwidth. As an application of these studies, the obtained
results are employed to optimise the loss performance of a 10-card shuffle
router and enable >=40 Gb/s data transmission.
"
816,On the Impact of Transposition Errors in Diffusion-Based Channels,"  In this work, we consider diffusion-based molecular communication with and
without drift between two static nano-machines. We employ type-based
information encoding, releasing a single molecule per information bit. At the
receiver, we consider an asynchronous detection algorithm which exploits the
arrival order of the molecules. In such systems, transposition errors
fundamentally undermine reliability and capacity. Thus, in this work we study
the impact of transpositions on the system performance. Towards this, we
present an analytical expression for the exact bit error probability (BEP)
caused by transpositions and derive computationally tractable approximations of
the BEP for diffusion-based channels with and without drift. Based on these
results, we analyze the BEP when background is not negligible and derive the
optimal bit interval that minimizes the BEP. Simulation results confirm the
theoretical results and show the error and goodput performance for different
parameters such as block size or noise generation rate.
"
817,"An Accurate Interconnect Test Structure for Parasitic Validation in
  On-Chip Machine Learning Accelerators","  For nanotechnology nodes, the feature size is shrunk rapidly, the wire
becomes narrow and thin, it leads to high RC parasitic, especially for
resistance. The overall system performance are dominated by interconnect rather
than device. As such, it is imperative to accurately measure and model
interconnect parasitic in order to predict interconnect performance on silicon.
Despite many test structures developed in the past to characterize device
models and layout effects, only few of them are available for interconnects.
Nevertheless, they are either not suitable for real chip implementation or too
complicated to be embedded. A compact yet comprehensive test structure to
capture all interconnect parasitic in a real chip is needed. To address this
problem, this paper describes a set of test structures that can be used to
study the timing performance (i.e. propagation delay and crosstalk) of various
interconnect configurations. Moreover, an empirical model is developed to
estimate the actual RC parasitic. Compared with the state-of-the-art
interconnect test structures, the new structure is compact in size and can be
easily embedded on die as a parasitic variation monitor. We have validated the
proposed structure on a test chip in TSMC 28nm HPM process. Recently, the test
structure is further modified to identify the serious interconnect process
issues for critical path design using TSMC 7nm FF process.
"
818,Improved Leader Election for Self-Organizing Programmable Matter,"  We consider programmable matter that consists of computationally limited
devices (called particles) that are able to self-organize in order to achieve
some collective goal without the need for central control or external
intervention. We use the geometric amoebot model to describe such
self-organizing particle systems, which defines how particles can actively move
and communicate with one another. In this paper, we present an efficient
local-control algorithm which solves the leader election problem in O(n)
asynchronous rounds with high probability, where n is the number of particles
in the system. Our algorithm relies only on local information --- particles do
not have unique identifiers, any knowledge of n, or any sort of global
coordinate system --- and requires only constant memory per particle.
"
819,Mixed-Precision In-Memory Computing,"  As CMOS scaling reaches its technological limits, a radical departure from
traditional von Neumann systems, which involve separate processing and memory
units, is needed in order to significantly extend the performance of today's
computers. In-memory computing is a promising approach in which nanoscale
resistive memory devices, organized in a computational memory unit, are used
for both processing and memory. However, to reach the numerical accuracy
typically required for data analytics and scientific computing, limitations
arising from device variability and non-ideal device characteristics need to be
addressed. Here we introduce the concept of mixed-precision in-memory
computing, which combines a von Neumann machine with a computational memory
unit. In this hybrid system, the computational memory unit performs the bulk of
a computational task, while the von Neumann machine implements a backward
method to iteratively improve the accuracy of the solution. The system
therefore benefits from both the high precision of digital computing and the
energy/areal efficiency of in-memory computing. We experimentally demonstrate
the efficacy of the approach by accurately solving systems of linear equations,
in particular, a system of 5,000 equations using 998,752 phase-change memory
devices.

  Alignment","  A novel processing-in-storage (PRinS) architecture based on Resistive CAM
(ReCAM) is described and proposed for Smith-Waterman (S-W) sequence alignment.
The ReCAM massively-parallel compare operation finds matching base-pairs in a
fixed number of cycles, regardless of sequence length. The ReCAM PRinS S-W
algorithm is simulated and compared to FPGA, Xeon Phi and GPU-based

"
821,"MorphoNoC: Exploring the Design Space of a Configurable Hybrid NoC using
  Nanophotonics","  As diminishing feature sizes drive down the energy for computations, the
power budget for on-chip communication is steadily rising. Furthermore, the
increasing number of cores is placing a huge performance burden on the
network-on-chip (NoC) infrastructure. While NoCs are designed as regular
architectures that allow scaling to hundreds of cores, the lack of a flexible
topology gives rise to higher latencies, lower throughput, and increased energy
costs. In this paper, we explore MorphoNoCs - scalable, configurable, hybrid
NoCs obtained by extending regular electrical networks with configurable
nanophotonic links. In order to design MorphoNoCs, we first carry out a
detailed study of the design space for Multi-Write Multi-Read (MWMR)
nanophotonics links. After identifying optimum design points, we then discuss
the router architecture for deploying them in hybrid electronic-photonic NoCs.
We then study explore the design space at the network level, by varying the
waveguide lengths and the number of hybrid routers. This affords us to carry
out energy-latency trade-offs. For our evaluations, we adopt traces from
synthetic benchmarks as well as the NAS Parallel Benchmark suite. Our results
indicate that MorphoNoCs can achieve latency improvements of up to 3.0x or
energy improvements of up to 1.37x over the base electronic network.
"
822,Nano-Intrinsic True Random Number Generation,"  Recent advances in predictive data analytics and ever growing digitalization
and connectivity with explosive expansions in industrial and consumer
Internet-of-Things (IoT) has raised significant concerns about security of
people's identities and data. It has created close to ideal environment for
adversaries in terms of the amount of data that could be used for modeling and
also greater accessibility for side-channel analysis of security primitives and
random number generators. Random number generators (RNGs) are at the core of
most security applications. Therefore, a secure and trustworthy source of
randomness is required to be found. Here, we present a differential circuit for
harvesting one of the most stochastic phenomenon in solid-state physics, random
telegraphic noise (RTN), that is designed to demonstrate significantly lower
sensitivities to other sources of noises, radiation and temperature
fluctuations. We use RTN in amorphous SrTiO3-based resistive memories to
evaluate the proposed true random number generator (TRNG). Successful
evaluation on conventional true randomness tests (NIST tests) has been shown.
Robustness against using predictive machine learning and side-channel attacks
have also been demonstrated in comparison with non-differential readouts
methods.
"
823,"Neurostream: Scalable and Energy Efficient Deep Learning with Smart
  Memory Cubes","  High-performance computing systems are moving towards 2.5D and 3D memory
hierarchies, based on High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) and Hybrid Memory Cube (HMC)
to mitigate the main memory bottlenecks. This trend is also creating new
opportunities to revisit near-memory computation. In this paper, we propose a
flexible processor-in-memory (PIM) solution for scalable and energy-efficient
execution of deep convolutional networks (ConvNets), one of the fastest-growing
workloads for servers and high-end embedded systems. Our codesign approach
consists of a network of Smart Memory Cubes (modular extensions to the standard
HMC) each augmented with a many-core PIM platform called NeuroCluster.
NeuroClusters have a modular design based on NeuroStream coprocessors (for
Convolution-intensive computations) and general-purpose RISCV cores. In
addition, a DRAM-friendly tiling mechanism and a scalable computation paradigm
are presented to efficiently harness this computational capability with a very
low programming effort. NeuroCluster occupies only 8% of the total logic-base
(LoB) die area in a standard HMC and achieves an average performance of 240
GFLOPS for complete execution of full-featured state-of-the-art (SoA) ConvNets
within a power budget of 2.5W. Overall 11 W is consumed in a single SMC device,
with 22.5 GFLOPS/W energy-efficiency which is 3.5X better than the best GPU
implementations in similar technologies. The minor increase in system-level
power and the negligible area increase make our PIM system a cost-effective and
energy efficient solution, easily scalable to 955 GFLOPS with a small network
of just four SMCs.
"
824,Neuromorphic computing with nanoscale spintronic oscillators,"  Neurons in the brain behave as non-linear oscillators, which develop rhythmic
activity and interact to process information. Taking inspiration from this
behavior to realize high density, low power neuromorphic computing will require
huge numbers of nanoscale non-linear oscillators. Indeed, a simple estimation
indicates that, in order to fit a hundred million oscillators organized in a
two-dimensional array inside a chip the size of a thumb, their lateral
dimensions must be smaller than one micrometer. However, despite multiple
theoretical proposals, there is no proof of concept today of neuromorphic
computing with nano-oscillators. Indeed, nanoscale devices tend to be noisy and
to lack the stability required to process data in a reliable way. Here, we show
experimentally that a nanoscale spintronic oscillator can achieve spoken digit
recognition with accuracies similar to state of the art neural networks. We
pinpoint the regime of magnetization dynamics leading to highest performance.
These results, combined with the exceptional ability of these spintronic
oscillators to interact together, their long lifetime, and low energy
consumption, open the path to fast, parallel, on-chip computation based on
networks of oscillators.
"
825,"An Enhanced Lumped Element Electrical Model of a Double Barrier
  Memristive Device","  The massive parallel approach of neuromorphic circuits leads to effective
methods for solving complex problems. It has turned out that resistive
switching devices with a continuous resistance range are potential candidates
for such applications. These devices are memristive systems - nonlinear
resistors with memory. They are fabricated in nanotechnology and hence
parameter spread during fabrication may aggravate reproducible analyses. This
issue makes simulation models of memristive devices worthwhile.
  Kinetic Monte-Carlo simulations based on a distributed model of the device
can be used to understand the underlying physical and chemical phenomena.
However, such simulations are very time-consuming and neither convenient for
investigations of whole circuits nor for real-time applications, e.g. emulation
purposes. Instead, a concentrated model of the device can be used for both fast
simulations and real-time applications, respectively. We introduce an enhanced
electrical model of a valence change mechanism (VCM) based double barrier
memristive device (DBMD) with a continuous resistance range. This device
consists of an ultra-thin memristive layer sandwiched between a tunnel barrier
and a Schottky-contact. The introduced model leads to very fast simulations by
using usual circuit simulation tools while maintaining physically meaningful
parameters.
  Kinetic Monte-Carlo simulations based on a distributed model and experimental
data have been utilized as references to verify the concentrated model.

826,"Energy-Efficient Memories using Magneto-Electric Switching of
  Ferromagnets","  Voltage driven magneto-electric (ME) switching of ferro-magnets has shown
potential for future low-energy spintronic memories. In this paper, we first
analyze two different ME devices viz. ME-MTJ and ME-XNOR device with respect to
writability, readability and switching speed. Our analysis is based on a
coupled magnetization dynamics and electron transport model. Subsequently, we
show that the decoupled read/write path of ME-MTJs can be utilized to construct
an energy-efficient dual port memory. Further, we also propose a novel content
addressable memory (CAM) exploiting the compact XNOR operation enabled by
ME-XNOR device.
"
827,"Semiempirical Modeling of Reset Transitions in Unipolar
  Resistive-Switching Based Memristors","  We have measured the transition process from the high to low resistivity
states, i.e., the reset process of resistive switching based memristors based
on Ni/HfO2/Si-n+ structures, and have also developed an analytical model for
their electrical characteristics. When the characteristic curves are plotted in
the current-voltage (I-V) domain a high variability is observed. In spite of
that, when the same curves are plotted in the charge-flux domain (Q-f), they
can be described by a simple model containing only three parameters: the charge
(Qrst) and the flux (frst) at the reset point, and an exponent, n, relating the
charge and the flux before the reset transition. The three parameters can be
easily extracted from the Q-f plots. There is a strong correlation between
these three parameters, the origin of which is still under study.
"
828,Experimental Comparison of Two Quantum Computing Architectures,"  We run a selection of algorithms on two state-of-the-art 5-qubit quantum
computers that are based on different technology platforms. One is a publicly
accessible superconducting transmon device with limited connectivity, and the
other is a fully connected trapped-ion system. Even though the two systems have
different native quantum interactions, both can be programmed in a way that is
blind to the underlying hardware, thus allowing the first comparison of
identical quantum algorithms between different physical systems. We show that
quantum algorithms and circuits that employ more connectivity clearly benefit
from a better connected system of qubits. While the quantum systems here are
not yet large enough to eclipse classical computers, this experiment exposes
critical factors of scaling quantum computers, such as qubit connectivity and
gate expressivity. In addition, the results suggest that co-designing
particular quantum applications with the hardware itself will be paramount in
successfully using quantum computers in the future.

829,"Spin Transfer Torque Driven Coupled Oscillators for Self-Oscillating RF
  Mixers","  Spin transfer torque oscillators (STOs) based on magnetic tunnel junction
(MTJ) devices are emerging as a possible replacement for complementary
metal-oxide semiconductors for radio-frequency (RF) signal generation.
Advantages include low power consumption, small device area, and large
frequency tunability. But such a single device cannot achieve the necessary
noise performance for RF applications. It has been reported lately that a
network of globally coupled STOs achieves significant improvement in phase
noise. The study here is to propose use of such coupled STOs as
self-oscillating RF mixers. Critical mixer performance parameters, including
conversion gain, output power, and linearity, are discussed.
"
830,Computability and Complexity of Unconventional Computing Devices,"  We discuss some claims that certain UCOMP devices can perform
hypercomputation (compute Turing-uncomputable functions) or perform
super-Turing computation (solve NP-complete problems in polynomial time). We
discover that all these claims rely on the provision of one or more unphysical
resources.
"
831,Mode-Division Multiplexing for Silicon Photonic Network-on-chip,"  Optical interconnect is a potential solution to attain the large bandwidth
on-chip communications needed in high performance computers in a low power and
low cost manner. Mode-division multiplexing (MDM) is an emerging technology
that scales the capacity of a single wavelength carrier by the number of modes
in a multimode waveguide, and is attractive as a cost-effective means for high
bandwidth density on-chip communications. Advanced modulation formats with high
spectral efficiency in MDM networks can further improve the data rates of the
optical link. Here, we demonstrate an intra-chip MDM communications link
employing advanced modulation formats with two waveguide modes. We demonstrate
a compact single wavelength carrier link that is expected to support 2x100 Gb/s
mode multiplexed capacity. The network comprised integrated microring
modulators at the transmitter, mode multiplexers, multimode waveguide
interconnect, mode demultiplexers and integrated germanium on silicon
photodetectors. Each of the mode channels achieves 100 Gb/s line rate with 84
Gb/s net payload data rate at 7% overhead for hard-decision forward error
correction (HD-FEC) in the OFDM/16-QAM signal transmission.
"
832,Reservoir Computing Using Non-Uniform Binary Cellular Automata,"  The Reservoir Computing (RC) paradigm utilizes a dynamical system, i.e., a
reservoir, and a linear classifier, i.e., a read-out layer, to process data
from sequential classification tasks. In this paper the usage of Cellular
Automata (CA) as a reservoir is investigated. The use of CA in RC has been
showing promising results. In this paper, selected state-of-the-art experiments
are reproduced. It is shown that some CA-rules perform better than others, and
the reservoir performance is improved by increasing the size of the CA
reservoir itself. In addition, the usage of parallel loosely coupled
CA-reservoirs, where each reservoir has a different CA-rule, is investigated.
The experiments performed on quasi-uniform CA reservoir provide valuable
insights in CA reservoir design. The results herein show that some rules do not
work well together, while other combinations work remarkably well. This
suggests that non-uniform CA could represent a powerful tool for novel CA
reservoir implementations.

  Study","  This paper presents a stochastic logic time delay reservoir design. The
reservoir is analyzed using a number of metrics, such as kernel quality,
generalization rank, performance on simple benchmarks, and is also compared to
a deterministic design. A novel re-seeding method is introduced to reduce the
adverse effects of stochastic noise, which may also be implemented in other
stochastic logic reservoir computing designs, such as echo state networks.
Benchmark results indicate that the proposed design performs well on
noise-tolerant classification problems, but more work needs to be done to
improve the stochastic logic time delay reservoir's robustness for regression
problems.

834,3DNA Printer: A Tool for Automated DNA Origami,"  In the last two decades, DNA self-assembly has grown into a major area of
research attracting people from diverse background. It has numerous potential
applications such as targeted drug delivery, artificial photosynthesis etc. In
the last decade, another area received wide attention known as DNA origami,
where using M13 virus and carefully designed staple strands one can fold the
DNA into desired 2-D and 3-D shapes. In 2016, a group of researchers at MIT
have developed an automated DNA nanostructures strategy and an open source
software 'daedalus' based on MATLAB for developing the nanostructures. In this
work, we present a truly open source software '3dnaprinter' based on Java
(without MATLAB) that can do the same work.

835,"Current Induced Dynamics of Multiple Skyrmions with Domain Wall Pair and
  Skyrmion-based Majority Gate Design","  As an intriguing ultra-small particle-like magnetic texture, skyrmion has
attracted lots of research interests in next-generation ultra-dense and low
power magnetic memory/logic designs. Previous studies have demonstrated a
single skyrmion-domain wall pair collision in a specially designed magnetic
racetrack junction. In this work, we investigate the dynamics of multiple
skyrmions with domain wall pair in a magnetic racetrack. The numerical
micromagnetic simulation results indicate that the domain wall pair could be
pinned or depinned by the rectangular notch pinning site depending on both the
number of skyrmions in the racetrack and the magnitude of driving current
density. Such emergent dynamical property could be used to implement a
threshold-tunable step function, in which the inputs are skyrmions and
threshold could be tuned by the driving current density. The threshold-tunable
step function is widely used in logic and neural network applications. We also
present a three-input skyrmion-based majority logic gate design to demonstrate
the potential application of such dynamic interaction of multiple skyrmions and
domain wall pair.
"
836,"Load Synchronization and Sustained Oscillations Induced by Transactive
  Control","  Transactive or market-based coordination strategies have recently been
proposed for controlling the aggregate demand of a large number of electric
loads. Such schemes offer operational benefits such as enforcing distribution
feeder capacity limits and providing users with flexibility to consume energy
based on the price they are willing to pay. However, this paper demonstrates
that they are also prone to load synchronization and power oscillations. A
transactive energy framework has been adopted and applied to a population of
thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs). A modified TCL switching logic takes
into account market coordination signals, alongside the natural
hysteresis-based switching conditions. Studies of this market-based
coordination scheme suggest that several factors may contribute to load
synchronism, including sharp changes in the market prices that are broadcast to
loads, lack of diversity in user specified bid curves, low feeder limits that
are encountered periodically, and the form of user bid curves. Case studies
illustrate challenges associated with market-based coordination strategies and
provide insights into modifications that address those issues.
"
837,A Novel Method of Discrete-Time Amplification using NEMS Devices,"  In this paper we propose a novel method of realizing discrete-time (D-T)
signal amplification using Nano-Electro-Mechanical (NEMS) devices. The
amplifier uses mechanical devices instead of traditional solid-state circuits.
The proposed NEMS-based D-T amplifier provides high gain and operate on a wide
dynamic range of signals, consuming only a few micro watts of power. The
proposed concept is subsequently verified using Verilog-A model of the NEMS
device. Modifications in the proposed amplifier to suit different
specifications are also presented.
"
838,"RESPARC: A Reconfigurable and Energy-Efficient Architecture with
  Memristive Crossbars for Deep Spiking Neural Networks","  Neuromorphic computing using post-CMOS technologies is gaining immense
popularity due to its promising abilities to address the memory and power
bottlenecks in von-Neumann computing systems. In this paper, we propose RESPARC
- a reconfigurable and energy efficient architecture built-on Memristive
Crossbar Arrays (MCA) for deep Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). Prior works were
primarily focused on device and circuit implementations of SNNs on crossbars.
RESPARC advances this by proposing a complete system for SNN acceleration and
its subsequent analysis. RESPARC utilizes the energy-efficiency of MCAs for
inner-product computation and realizes a hierarchical reconfigurable design to
incorporate the data-flow patterns in an SNN in a scalable fashion. We evaluate
the proposed architecture on different SNNs ranging in complexity from 2k-230k
neurons and 1.2M-5.5M synapses. Simulation results on these networks show that
compared to the baseline digital CMOS architecture, RESPARC achieves 500X (15X)
efficiency in energy benefits at 300X (60X) higher throughput for multi-layer
perceptrons (deep convolutional networks). Furthermore, RESPARC is a
technology-aware architecture that maps a given SNN topology to the most
optimized MCA size for the given crossbar technology.
"
839,Shannon-inspired Statistical Computing to Enable Spintronics,"  Modern computing systems based on the von Neumann architecture are built from
silicon complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) transistors that need to
operate under practically error free conditions with 1 error in $10^{15}$
switching events. The physical dimensions of CMOS transistors have scaled down
over the past five decades leading to exponential increases in functional
density and energy consumption. Today, the energy and delay reductions from
scaling have stagnated, motivating the search for a CMOS replacement. Of these,
spintronics offers a path for enhancing the functional density and scaling the
energy down to fundamental thermodynamic limits of 100kT to 1000kT. However,
spintronic devices exhibit high error rates of 1 in 10 or more when operating
at these limits, rendering them incompatible with deterministic nature of the
von Neumann architecture. We show that a Shannon-inspired statistical computing
framework can be leveraged to design a computer made from such stochastic
spintronic logic gates to provide a computational accuracy close to that of a
deterministic computer. This extraordinary result allowing a $10^{13}$ fold
relaxation in acceptable error rates is obtained by engineering the error
distribution coupled with statistical error compensation.
"
840,Exact Synthesis of Reversible Logic Circuits using Model Checking,"  Synthesis of reversible logic circuits has gained great atten- tion during
the last decade. Various synthesis techniques have been pro- posed, some
generate optimal solutions (in gate count) and are termed as exact, while
others are scalable in the sense that they can handle larger functions but
generate sub-optimal solutions. Although scalable synthe- sis is very much
essential for circuit design, exact synthesis is also of great importance as it
helps in building design library for the synthesis of larger functions. In this
paper, we propose an exact synthesis technique for re- versible circuits using
model checking. We frame the synthesis problem as a model checking instance and
propose an iterative bounded model checking calls for an optimal synthesis.
Experiments on reversible logic benchmarks shows successful synthesis of
optimal circuits. We also illus- trate optimal synthesis of random functions
with as many as 10 variables and up to 10 gates.
"
841,R$^3$PUF: A Highly Reliable Memristive Device based Reconfigurable PUF,"  We present a memristive device based R$ ^3 $PUF construction achieving highly
desired PUF properties, which are not offered by most current PUF designs: (1)
High reliability, almost 100\% that is crucial for PUF-based cryptographic key
generations, significantly reducing, or even eliminating the expensive overhead
of on-chip error correction logic and the associated helper on-chip data
storage or off-chip storage and transfer. (2) Reconfigurability, while current
PUF designs rarely exhibit such an attractive property. We validate our R$ ^3
$PUF via extensive Monte-Carlo simulations in Cadence based on parameters of
real devices. The R$ ^3 $PUF is simple, cost-effective and easy to manage
compared to other PUF constructions exhibiting high reliability or
reconfigurability. None of previous PUF constructions is able to provide both
desired high reliability and reconfigurability concurrently.
"
842,Building a Completely Reversible Computer,"  A critical analysis of the feasibility of reversible computing is performed.
The key question is: Is it possible to build a completely reversible computer?
A closer look into the internal aspects of the reversible computing as well as
the external constraints such as the second law of thermodynamics has
demonstrated that several difficulties would have to be solved before
reversible computer is being built. It is shown that a conventional reversible
computer would require energy for setting up the reversible inputs from
irreversible signals, for the reading out of the reversible outputs, for the
transport of the information between logic elements and finally for the control
signals that will require more energy dissipating into the environment. A loose
bound on the minimum amount of energy required to be dissipated during the
physical implementation of a reversible computer is obtained and a
generalization of the principles for reversible computing is provided.
"
843,Computers from plants we never made. Speculations,"  We discuss possible designs and prototypes of computing systems that could be
based on morphological development of roots, interaction of roots, and analog
electrical computation with plants, and plant-derived electronic components. In
morphological plant processors data are represented by initial configuration of
roots and configurations of sources of attractants and repellents; results of
computation are represented by topology of the roots' network. Computation is
implemented by the roots following gradients of attractants and repellents, as
well as interacting with each other. Problems solvable by plant roots, in
principle, include shortest-path, minimum spanning tree, Voronoi diagram,
$\alpha$-shapes, convex subdivision of concave polygons. Electrical properties
of plants can be modified by loading the plants with functional nanoparticles
or coating parts of plants of conductive polymers. Thus, we are in position to
make living variable resistors, capacitors, operational amplifiers,
multipliers, potentiometers and fixed-function generators. The electrically
modified plants can implement summation, integration with respect to time,
inversion, multiplication, exponentiation, logarithm, division. Mathematical
and engineering problems to be solved can be represented in plant root networks
of resistive or reaction elements. Developments in plant-based computing
architectures will trigger emergence of a unique community of biologists,
electronic engineering and computer scientists working together to produce
living electronic devices which future green computers will be made of.

844,"Memristor nanodevice for unconventional computing:review and
  applications","  A memristor is a two-terminal nanodevice that its properties attract a wide
community of researchers from various domains such as physics, chemistry,
electronics, computer and neuroscience.The simple structure for manufacturing,
small scalability, nonvolatility and potential of using inlow power platforms
are outstanding characteristics of this emerging nanodevice. In this report,we

"
845,"Optimized Aaronson-Gottesman stabilizer circuit simulation through
  quantum circuit transformations","  In this paper we improve the layered implementation of arbitrary stabilizer
circuits introduced by Aaronson and Gottesman in {\it Phys. Rev. A 70(052328)},
2004. In particular, we reduce their 11-stage computation
-H-C-P-C-P-C-H-P-C-P-C- into an 8-stage computation of the form
-H-C-CZ-P-H-P-CZ-C-. We show arguments in support of using -CZ- stages over the
-C- stages: not only the use of -CZ- stages allows a shorter layered
expression, but -CZ- stages are simpler and appear to be easier to implement
compared to the -C- stages. Relying on the 8-stage decomposition we develop a
two-qubit depth-$(14n-4)$ implementation of stabilizer circuits over the gate
library {P,H,CNOT}, executable in the LNN architecture, improving best
previously known depth-$25n$ circuit, also executable in the LNN architecture.
Our constructions rely on folding arbitrarily long sequences $($-P-C-$)^m$ into
a 3-stage computation -P-CZ-C-, as well as efficient implementation of the -CZ-
stage circuits.
"
846,A compact Verilog-A ReRAM switching model,"  The translation of emerging application concepts that exploit Resistive
Random Access Memory (ReRAM) into large-scale practical systems requires
realistic, yet computationally efficient, empirical models that can capture all
observed physical devices. Here, we present a Verilog-A ReRAM model built upon
experimental routines performed on TiOx-based prototypes. This model was based
on custom biasing protocols, specifically designed to reveal device switching
rate dependencies on a) bias voltage and b) initial resistive state. Our model
is based on the assumption that a stationary switching rate surface m(R,v)
exists for sufficiently low voltage stimulation. The proposed model comes in
compact form as it is expressed by a simple voltage dependent exponential
function multiplied with a voltage and initial resistive state dependent second
order polynomial expression, which makes it suitable for fast and/or
large-scale simulations.
"
847,Towards implementation of Cellular Automata in Microbial Fuel Cells,"  The Microbial Fuel Cell (MFC) is a bio-electrochemical transducer converting
waste products into electricity using microbial communities. Cellular Automaton
(CA) is a uniform array of finite-state machines that update their states in
discrete time depending on states of their closest neighbors by the same rule.
Arrays of MFCs could, in principle, act as massive-parallel computing devices
with local connectivity between elementary processors. We provide a theoretical
design of such a parallel processor by implementing CA in MFCs. We have chosen
Conway's Game of Life as the 'benchmark' CA because this is the most popular CA
which also exhibits an enormously rich spectrum of patterns. Each cell of the
Game of Life CA is realized using two MFCs. The MFCs are linked electrically
and hydraulically. The model is verified via simulation of an electrical
circuit demonstrating equivalent behaviors. The design is a first step towards
future implementations of fully autonomous biological computing devices with
massive parallelism. The energy independence of such devices counteracts their
somewhat slow transitions - compared to silicon circuitry - between the
different states during computation.
"
848,A/D Converter Architectures for Energy-Efficient Vision Processor,"  AI applications have emerged in current world. Among AI applications,
computer-vision (CV) related applications have attracted high interest.
Hardware implementation of CV processors necessitates a high performance but
low-power image detector. The key to energy-efficiency work lies in
analog-digital converting, where output of imaging detectors is transferred to
digital domain and CV algorithms can be performed on data. In this paper,
analog-digital converter architectures are compared, and an example ADC design
is proposed which achieves both good performance and low power consumption.
"
849,"A Physarum-inspired model for the probit-based stochastic user
  equilibrium problem","  Stochastic user equilibrium is an important issue in the traffic assignment
problems, tradition models for the stochastic user equilibrium problem are
designed as mathematical programming problems. In this article, a
Physarum-inspired model for the probit-based stochastic user equilibrium
problem is proposed. There are two main contributions of our work. On the one
hand, the origin Physarum model is modified to find the shortest path in
traffic direction networks with the properties of two-way traffic
characteristic. On the other hand, the modified Physarum-inspired model could
get the equilibrium flows when traveller's perceived transportation cost
complies with normal distribution. The proposed method is constituted with a
two-step procedure. First, the modified Physarum model is applied to get the
auxiliary flows. Second, the auxiliary flows are averaged to obtain the
equilibrium flows. Numerical examples are conducted to illustrate the
performance of the proposed method, which is compared with the Method of
Successive Average method.
"
850,Computing in Memory with Spin-Transfer Torque Magnetic RAM,"  In-memory computing is a promising approach to addressing the
processor-memory data transfer bottleneck in computing systems. We propose
Spin-Transfer Torque Compute-in-Memory (STT-CiM), a design for in-memory
computing with Spin-Transfer Torque Magnetic RAM (STT-MRAM). The unique
properties of spintronic memory allow multiple wordlines within an array to be
simultaneously enabled, opening up the possibility of directly sensing
functions of the values stored in multiple rows using a single access. We
propose modifications to STT-MRAM peripheral circuits that leverage this
principle to perform logic, arithmetic, and complex vector operations. We
address the challenge of reliable in-memory computing under process variations
by extending ECC schemes to detect and correct errors that occur during CiM
operations. We also address the question of how STT-CiM should be integrated
within a general-purpose computing system. To this end, we propose
architectural enhancements to processor instruction sets and on-chip buses that
enable STT-CiM to be utilized as a scratchpad memory. Finally, we present data
mapping techniques to increase the effectiveness of STT-CiM. We evaluate
STT-CiM using a device-to-architecture modeling framework, and integrate
cycle-accurate models of STT-CiM with a commercial processor and on-chip bus
(Nios II and Avalon from Intel). Our system-level evaluation shows that STT-CiM
provides system-level performance improvements of 3.93x on average (upto
10.4x), and concurrently reduces memory system energy by 3.83x on average (upto
12.4x).
"
851,Absence of chaos in Digital Memcomputing Machines with solutions,"  Digital memcomputing machines (DMMs) are non-linear dynamical systems
designed so that their equilibrium points are solutions of the Boolean problem
they solve. In a previous work [Chaos 27, 023107 (2017)] it was argued that
when DMMs support solutions of the associated Boolean problem then strange
attractors cannot coexist with such equilibria. In this work, we demonstrate
such conjecture. In particular, we show that both topological transitivity and
the strongest property of topological mixing are inconsistent with the point
dissipative property of DMMs when equilibrium points are present. This is true
for both the whole phase space and the global attractor. Absence of topological
transitivity is enough to imply absence of chaotic behavior. In a similar vein,
we prove that if DMMs do not have equilibrium points, the only attractors
present are invariant tori/periodic orbits with periods that may possibly
increase with system size (quasi-attractors).
"
852,Deep Reservoir Computing Using Cellular Automata,"  Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have been a prominent concept within
artificial intelligence. They are inspired by Biological Neural Networks (BNNs)
and provide an intuitive and abstract representation of how BNNs work. Derived
from the more generic Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), the recurrent ones are
meant to be used for temporal tasks, such as speech recognition, because they
are capable of memorizing historic input. However, such networks are very time
consuming to train as a result of their inherent nature. Recently, Echo State
Networks and Liquid State Machines have been proposed as possible RNN
alternatives, under the name of Reservoir Computing (RC). RCs are far more easy
to train. In this paper, Cellular Automata are used as reservoir, and are
tested on the 5-bit memory task (a well known benchmark within the RC
community). The work herein provides a method of mapping binary inputs from the
task onto the automata, and a recurrent architecture for handling the
sequential aspects of it. Furthermore, a layered (deep) reservoir architecture
is proposed. Performances are compared towards earlier work, in addition to its
single-layer version. Results show that the single CA reservoir system yields
similar results to state-of-the-art work. The system comprised of two layered
reservoirs do show a noticeable improvement compared to a single CA reservoir.
This indicates potential for further research and provides valuable insight on
how to design CA reservoir systems.
"
853,"An Accurate and Efficient Method to Calculate the Error Statistics of
  Block-based Approximate Adders","  Adders are key building blocks of many error-tolerant applications.
Leveraging the application-level error tolerance, a number of approximate
adders were proposed recently. Many of them belong to the category of
block-based approximate adders. For approximate circuits, besides normal
metrics such as area and delay, another important metric is the error
measurement. Given the popularity of block-based approximate adders, in this
work, we propose an accurate and efficient method to obtain the error
statistics of these adders. We first show how to calculate the error rates.
Then, we demonstrate an approach to get the exact error distribution, which can
be used to calculate other error characteristics, such as mean error distance
and mean square error.
"
854,"Memristive circuits and their Newtonian models $\phi
  ''=F(t,\phi,\phi')/m$ with memory","  The prediction made by L. O. Chua 45+ years ago (see: IEEE Trans. Circuit
Theory (1971) 18:507-519 and also: Proc. IEEE (2012) 100:1920-1927) about the
existence of a passive circuit element (called memristor) that links the charge
and flux variables has been confirmed by the HP lab group in its report (see:
Nature (2008) 453:80-83) on a successful construction of such an element. This
sparked an enormous interest in mem-elements, analysis of their unusual
dynamical properties (i.e. pinched hysteresis loops, memory effects, etc.) and
construction of their emulators. Such topics are also of interest in mechanical
engineering where memdampers (or memory dampers) play the role equivalent to
memristors in electronic circuits. In this paper we discuss certain properties
of the oscillatory memristive circuits, including those with mixed-mode
oscillations. Mathematical models of such circuits can be linked to the
Newton's law $\phi''\!-\!F(t,\phi,\phi')/m=0$, with $\phi$ denoting the flux or
charge variables, $m$ is a positive constant and the nonlinear non-autonomous
function $F(t,\phi,\phi')$ contains memory terms. This leads further to scalar
fourth-order ODEs called the jounce Newtonian equations. The jounce equations
are used to construct the $RC$+op-amp simulation circuits in SPICE. Also, the
linear parallel $G$-$C$ and series $R$-$L$ circuits with sinusoidal inputs are
derived to match the $rms$ values of the memristive periodic circuits.
"
855,"HyPPI NoC: Bringing Hybrid Plasmonics to an Opto-Electronic
  Network-on-Chip","  As we move towards an era of hundreds of cores, the research community has
witnessed the emergence of opto-electronic network on-chip designs based on
nanophotonics, in order to achieve higher network throughput, lower latencies,
and lower dynamic power. However, traditional nanophotonics options face
limitations such as large device footprints compared with electronics, higher
static power due to continuous laser operation, and an upper limit on
achievable data rates due to large device capacitances. Nanoplasmonics is an
emerging technology that has the potential for providing transformative gains
on multiple metrics due to its potential to increase the light-matter
interaction. In this paper, we propose and analyze a hybrid opto-electric NoC
that incorporates Hybrid Plasmonics Photonics Interconnect (HyPPI), an optical
interconnect that combines photonics with plasmonics. We explore various
opto-electronic network hybridization options by augmenting a mesh network with
HyPPI links, and compare them with the equivalent options afforded by
conventional nanophotonics as well as pure electronics. Our design space
exploration indicates that augmenting an electronic NoC with HyPPI gives a
performance to cost ratio improvement of up to 1.8x. To further validate our
estimates, we conduct trace based simulations using the NAS Parallel Benchmark
suite. These benchmarks show latency improvements up to 1.64x, with negligible
energy increase. We then further carry out performance and cost projections for
fully optical NoCs, using HyPPI as well as conventional nanophotonics. These
futuristic projections indicate that all-HyPPI NoCs would be two orders more
energy efficient than electronics, and two orders more area efficient than
all-photonic NoCs.
"
856,Self-Assembly of 4-sided Fractals in the Two-handed Tile Assembly Model,"  We consider the self-assembly of fractals in one of the most well-studied
models of tile based self-assembling systems known as the Two-handed Tile
Assembly Model (2HAM). In particular, we focus our attention on a class of
fractals called discrete self-similar fractals (a class of fractals that
includes the discrete Sierpi\'nski carpet). We present a 2HAM system that
finitely self-assembles the discrete Sierpi\'nski carpet with scale factor 1.
Moreover, the 2HAM system that we give lends itself to being generalized and we
describe how this system can be modified to obtain a 2HAM system that finitely
self-assembles one of any fractal from an infinite set of fractals which we
call 4-sided fractals. The 2HAM systems we give in this paper are the first
examples of systems that finitely self-assemble discrete self-similar fractals
at scale factor 1 in a purely growth model of self-assembly. Finally, we show
that there exists a 3-sided fractal (which is not a tree fractal) that cannot
be finitely self-assembled by any 2HAM system.
"
857,Destructive Read by Wave Interference for Arbitration,"  With the advent of big data and deep learning, computation power has become a
bottleneck for many applications. Network-on-Chip (NoC) has been proposed to
enable multiprocessor acceleration for deep learning computation, and efficient
arbitration is a key issue for high performance. In this paper, an arbitration
scheme based on interference of wave is proposed. In this scheme, home node
sends out multiple tokens in different frequencies, and nodes that are
competing for bus can capture token by sending out wave that cancels its
specific wave token. In this scheme, speed-of-light arbitration can be
achieved, and full information is available to all nodes in arbitration.
"
858,Chaotic-Based Processor for Communication and Multimedia Applications,"  Chaos is a phenomenon that attracted much attention in the past ten years. In
this paper, we analyze chaos-based signal processing, and proposed a chaos
processor to take advantage of chaos phenomenon. We also analyzed and
demonstrated two of its practical applications in communication and sound
synthesis.
"
859,"Effective Enzyme Deployment for Degradation of Interference Molecules in
  Molecular Communication","  In molecular communication, the heavy tail nature of molecular signals causes
inter-symbol interference (ISI). Because of this, it is difficult to decrease
symbol periods and achieve high data rate. As a probable solution for ISI
mitigation, enzymes were proposed to be used since they are capable of
degrading ISI molecules without deteriorating the molecular communication.
While most prior work has assumed an infinite amount of enzymes deployed around
the channel, from a resource perspective, it is more efficient to deploy a
limited amount of enzymes at particular locations and structures. This paper
considers carrying out such deployment at two structures--around the receiver
(Rx) and/or the transmitter (Tx) site. For both of the deployment scenarios,
channels with different system environment parameters, Tx-to-Rx distance, size
of enzyme area, and symbol period, are compared with each other for analyzing
an optimized system environment for ISI mitigation when a limited amount of
enzymes are available.
"
860,"An Accelerated Analog Neuromorphic Hardware System Emulating NMDA- and
  Calcium-Based Non-Linear Dendrites","  This paper presents an extension of the BrainScaleS accelerated analog
neuromorphic hardware model. The scalable neuromorphic architecture is extended
by the support for multi-compartment models and non-linear dendrites. These
features are part of a \SI{65}{\nano\meter} prototype ASIC. It allows to
emulate different spike types observed in cortical pyramidal neurons: NMDA
plateau potentials, calcium and sodium spikes. By replicating some of the
structures of these cells, they can be configured to perform coincidence
detection within a single neuron. Built-in plasticity mechanisms can modify not
only the synaptic weights, but also the dendritic synaptic composition to
efficiently train large multi-compartment neurons. Transistor-level simulations
demonstrate the functionality of the analog implementation and illustrate
analogies to biological measurements.
"
861,Cooperative In-Vivo Nano-Network Communication at Terahertz Frequencies,"  Nano devices have great potential to play a vital role in future medical
diagnostics and treatment technologies because of its non-invasive nature and
ability to reach delicate body sites easily as compared to conventional
devices. In this paper, a novel concept of cooperative communication for
in-vivo nano-network is presented to enhance the communication among these
devices. The effect on the system outage probability performance is conducted
for various parameters including relay lacement, number of relays, transmit
power, bandwidth and carrier frequency. Results show approximately a 10-fold
increase in the system outage performance whenever an additional relay is
included in the cooperative network, hence show a great potential of using
cooperative communication to enhance the performance of nano-network at
terahertz frequencies.
"
862,A Time-shared Photonic Reservoir Computer for Big Data Analytics,"  Information processing has reached the era of big data. Big data challenges
are difficult to address with traditional Von Neumann or Turing approach. Hence
implementation of new computational techniques is highly essential.
Nanophotonics with its remarkable speed and multiplexing capability is a
promising candidate for such implementations. This paper proposes a novel
photonic computing system made-up of Mach-Zehnder interferometer and an optical
fiber spool to emulate a powerful machine learning technique called reservoir
computing. The proposed system is also integrated with a
time-division-multiplexing circuit to facilitate parallel computation of
multiple tasks which is first of its kind. The proposed design performs
large-scale tasks like spoken digit recognition, channel equalization, and
time-series prediction. Experimental results with standard photonic simulator
demonstrate significant performance in terms of speed and accuracy compared to
state of the art digital and software implementations.
"
863,Depth-Optimal Quantum Circuit Placement for Arbitrary Topologies,"  A significant hurdle towards realization of practical and scalable quantum
computing is to protect the quantum states from inherent noises during the
computation. In physical implementation of quantum circuits, a long-distance
interaction between two qubits is undesirable since, it can be interpreted as a
noise. Therefore, multiple quantum technologies and quantum error correcting
codes strongly require the interacting qubits to be arranged in a nearest
neighbor (NN) fashion. The current literature on converting a given quantum
circuit to an NN-arranged one mainly considered chained qubit topologies or
Linear Nearest Neighbor (LNN) topology. However, practical quantum circuit
realizations, such as Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), may not have an LNN
topology. To address this gap, we consider an arbitrary qubit topology. We
present an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulation for achieving minimal
logical depth while guaranteeing the nearest neighbor arrangement between the
interacting qubits. We substantiate our claim with studies on diverse network
topologies and prominent quantum circuit benchmarks.
"
864,One- and Two-Way Relay Optimization for MIMO Interference Networks,"  This paper considers multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) relay
communication in multi-cellular (interference) systems in which MIMO
source-destination pairs communicate simultaneously. It is assumed that due to
severe attenuation and/or shadowing effects, communication links can be
established only with the aid of a relay node. The aim is to minimize the
maximal mean-square-error (MSE) among all the receiving nodes under constrained
source and relay transmit powers. Both one- and two-way amplify-and-forward
(AF) relaying mechanisms are considered. Since the exactly optimal solution for
this practically appealing problem is intractable, we first propose optimizing
the source, relay, and receiver matrices in an alternating fashion. Then we
contrive a simplified semidefinite programming (SDP) solution based on the
error covariance matrix decomposition technique, avoiding the high complexity
of the iterative process. Numerical results reveal the effectiveness of the
proposed schemes.
"
865,Memristor equations: incomplete physics and undefined passivity/activity,"  In his seminal paper, Chua presented a fundamental physical claim by
introducing the memristor, ""The missing circuit element"". The memristor
equations were originally supposed to represent a passive circuit element
because, with active circuitry, arbitrary elements can be realized without
limitations. Therefore, if the memristor equations do not guarantee that the
circuit element can be realized by a passive system, the fundamental physics
claim about the memristor as ""missing circuit element"" loses all its weight.
The question of passivity/activity belongs to physics thus we incorporate
thermodynamics into the study of this problem. We show that the memristor
equations are physically incomplete regarding the problem of
passivity/activity. As a consequence, the claim that the present memristor
functions describe a passive device lead to unphysical results, such as
violating the Second Law of thermodynamics, in infinitely large number of
cases. The seminal memristor equations cannot introduce a new physical circuit
element without making the model more physical such as providing the

866,Complete 3-Qubit Grover Search on a Programmable Quantum Computer,"  Searching large databases is an important problem with broad applications.
The Grover search algorithm provides a powerful method for quantum computers to
perform searches with a quadratic speedup in the number of required database
queries over classical computers. It is an optimal search algorithm for a
quantum computer, and has further applications as a subroutine for other
quantum algorithms. Searches with two qubits have been demonstrated on a
variety of platforms and proposed for others, but larger search spaces have
only been demonstrated on a non-scalable NMR system. Here, we report results
for a complete three-qubit Grover search algorithm using the scalable quantum
computing technology of trapped atomic ions, with better-than-classical
performance. The algorithm is performed for all 8 possible single-result
oracles and all 28 possible two-result oracles. Two methods of state marking
are used for the oracles: a phase-flip method employed by other experimental
demonstrations, and a Boolean method requiring an ancilla qubit that is
directly equivalent to the state-marking scheme required to perform a classical
search. All quantum solutions are shown to outperform their classical
counterparts. We also report the first implementation of a Toffoli-4 gate,
which is used along with Toffoli-3 gates to construct the algorithms; these
gates have process fidelities of 70.5% and 89.6%, respectively.

867,"Deep Neural Network Optimized to Resistive Memory with Nonlinear
  Current-Voltage Characteristics","  Artificial Neural Network computation relies on intensive vector-matrix
multiplications. Recently, the emerging nonvolatile memory (NVM) crossbar array
showed a feasibility of implementing such operations with high energy
efficiency, thus there are many works on efficiently utilizing emerging NVM
crossbar array as analog vector-matrix multiplier. However, its nonlinear I-V
characteristics restrain critical design parameters, such as the read voltage
and weight range, resulting in substantial accuracy loss. In this paper,
instead of optimizing hardware parameters to a given neural network, we propose
a methodology of reconstructing a neural network itself optimized to resistive
memory crossbar arrays. To verify the validity of the proposed method, we
simulated various neural network with MNIST and CIFAR-10 dataset using two
different specific Resistive Random Access Memory (RRAM) model. Simulation
results show that our proposed neural network produces significantly higher
inference accuracies than conventional neural network when the synapse devices
have nonlinear I-V characteristics.
"
868,"Machine Learning based Channel Modeling for Molecular MIMO
  Communications","  In diffusion-based molecular communication, information particles locomote
via a diffusion process, characterized by random movement and heavy tail
distribution for the random arrival time. As a result, the molecular
communication shows lower transmission rates. To compensate for such low rates,
researchers have recently proposed the molecular multiple-input multiple-output
(MIMO) technique. Although channel models exist for single-input single-output
(SISO) systems for some simple environments, extending the results to multiple
molecular emitters complicates the modeling process. In this paper, we
introduce a technique for modeling the molecular MIMO channel and confirm the
effectiveness via numerical studies.
"
869,0.5 Petabyte Simulation of a 45-Qubit Quantum Circuit,"  Near-term quantum computers will soon reach sizes that are challenging to
directly simulate, even when employing the most powerful supercomputers. Yet,
the ability to simulate these early devices using classical computers is
crucial for calibration, validation, and benchmarking. In order to make use of
the full potential of systems featuring multi- and many-core processors, we use
automatic code generation and optimization of compute kernels, which also
enables performance portability. We apply a scheduling algorithm to quantum
supremacy circuits in order to reduce the required communication and simulate a
45-qubit circuit on the Cori II supercomputer using 8,192 nodes and 0.5
petabytes of memory. To our knowledge, this constitutes the largest quantum
circuit simulation to this date. Our highly-tuned kernels in combination with
the reduced communication requirements allow an improvement in time-to-solution
over state-of-the-art simulations by more than an order of magnitude at every
scale.
"
870,Architectural Techniques to Enable Reliable and Scalable Memory Systems,"  High capacity and scalable memory systems play a vital role in enabling our
desktops, smartphones, and pervasive technologies like Internet of Things
(IoT). Unfortunately, memory systems are becoming increasingly prone to faults.
This is because we rely on technology scaling to improve memory density, and at
small feature sizes, memory cells tend to break easily. Today, memory
reliability is seen as the key impediment towards using high-density devices,
adopting new technologies, and even building the next Exascale supercomputer.
To ensure even a bare-minimum level of reliability, present-day solutions tend
to have high performance, power and area overheads. Ideally, we would like
memory systems to remain robust, scalable, and implementable while keeping the
overheads to a minimum. This dissertation describes how simple cross-layer
architectural techniques can provide orders of magnitude higher reliability and
enable seamless scalability for memory systems while incurring negligible
overheads.
"
871,Molecular Communication using Magnetic Nanoparticles,"  In this paper, we propose to use magnetic nanoparticles as information
carriers for molecular communication. This enables the use of an external
magnetic field to guide information-carrying particles towards the receiver. We
show that the particle movement can be mathematically modeled as diffusion with
drift. Thereby, we reveal that the key parameters determining the magnetic
force are particle size and magnetic field gradient. As an example, we consider
magnetic nanoparticle based communication in a bounded two-dimensional
environment. For this model, we derive an analytical expression for the channel
impulse response subject to fluid flow and magnetic drift. Furthermore,
adopting the symbol error rate as performance metric, we show that using
magnetic nanoparticles facilitates reliable communication, even in the presence
of fluid flow.
"
872,Ultrafast photonic reinforcement learning based on laser chaos,"  Reinforcement learning involves decision making in dynamic and uncertain
environments, and constitutes one important element of artificial intelligence
(AI). In this paper, we experimentally demonstrate that the ultrafast chaotic
oscillatory dynamics of lasers efficiently solve the multi-armed bandit problem
(MAB), which requires decision making concerning a class of difficult
trade-offs called the exploration-exploitation dilemma. To solve the MAB, a
certain degree of randomness is required for exploration purposes. However,
pseudo-random numbers generated using conventional electronic circuitry
encounter severe limitations in terms of their data rate and the quality of
randomness due to their algorithmic foundations. We generate laser chaos
signals using a semiconductor laser sampled at a maximum rate of 100 GSample/s,
and combine it with a simple decision-making principle called tug-of-war with a
variable threshold, to ensure ultrafast, adaptive and accurate decision making
at a maximum adaptation speed of 1 GHz. We found that decision-making
performance was maximized with an optimal sampling interval, and we highlight
the exact coincidence between the negative autocorrelation inherent in laser
chaos and decision-making performance. This study paves the way for a new realm
of ultrafast photonics in the age of AI, where the ultrahigh bandwidth of
photons can provide new value.
"
873,"A Novel Experimental Platform for In-Vessel Multi-Chemical Molecular
  Communications","  This work presents a new multi-chemical experimental platform for molecular
communication where the transmitter can release different chemicals. This
platform is designed to be inexpensive and accessible, and it can be expanded
to simulate different environments including the cardiovascular system and
complex network of pipes in industrial complexes and city infrastructures. To
demonstrate the capabilities of the platform, we implement a time-slotted
binary communication system where a bit-0 is represented by an acid pulse, a
bit-1 by a base pulse, and information is carried via pH signals. The channel
model for this system, which is nonlinear and has long memories, is unknown.
Therefore, we devise novel detection algorithms that use techniques from
machine learning and deep learning to train a maximum-likelihood detector.
Using these algorithms the bit error rate improves by an order of magnitude
relative to the approach used in previous works. Moreover, our system achieves
a data rate that is an order of magnitude higher than any of the previous
molecular communication platforms.
"
874,"Fast and Accurate Sparse Coding of Visual Stimuli with a Simple,
  Ultra-Low-Energy Spiking Architecture","  Memristive crossbars have become a popular means for realizing unsupervised
and supervised learning techniques. In previous neuromorphic architectures with
leaky integrate-and-fire neurons, the crossbar itself has been separated from
the neuron capacitors to preserve mathematical rigor. In this work, we sought
to simplify the design, creating a fast circuit that consumed significantly
lower power at a minimal cost of accuracy. We also showed that connecting the
neurons directly to the crossbar resulted in a more efficient sparse coding
architecture, and alleviated the need to pre-normalize receptive fields. This
work provides derivations for the design of such a network, named the Simple
Spiking Locally Competitive Algorithm, or SSLCA, as well as CMOS designs and
results on the CIFAR and MNIST datasets. Compared to a non-spiking model which
scored 33% on CIFAR-10 with a single-layer classifier, this hardware scored 32%
accuracy. When used with a state-of-the-art deep learning classifier, the
non-spiking model achieved 82% and our simplified, spiking model achieved 80%,
while compressing the input data by 92%. Compared to a previously proposed
spiking model, our proposed hardware consumed 99% less energy to do the same
work at 21x the throughput. Accuracy held out with online learning to a write
variance of 3%, suitable for the often-reported 4-bit resolution required for
neuromorphic algorithms; with offline learning to a write variance of 27%; and
with read variance to 40%. The proposed architecture's excellent accuracy,
throughput, and significantly lower energy usage demonstrate the utility of our
innovations.
"
875,Memcapacitive Devices in Logic and Crossbar Applications,"  Over the last decade, memristive devices have been widely adopted in
computing for various conventional and unconventional applications. While the
integration density, memory property, and nonlinear characteristics have many
benefits, reducing the energy consumption is limited by the resistive nature of
the devices. Memcapacitors would address that limitation while still having all
the benefits of memristors. Recent work has shown that with adjusted parameters
during the fabrication process, a metal-oxide device can indeed exhibit a
memcapacitive behavior. We introduce novel memcapacitive logic gates and
memcapacitive crossbar classifiers as a proof of concept that such applications
can outperform memristor-based architectures. The results illustrate that,
compared to memristive logic gates, our memcapacitive gates consume about 7x
less power. The memcapacitive crossbar classifier achieves similar
classification performance but reduces the power consumption by a factor of
about 1,500x for the MNIST dataset and a factor of about 1,000x for the
CIFAR-10 dataset compared to a memristive crossbar. Our simulation results
demonstrate that memcapacitive devices have great potential for both Boolean
logic and analog low-power applications.
"
876,A Survey and Discussion of Memcomputing Machines,"  This paper serves as a review and discussion of the recent works on
memcomputing. In particular, the $\textit{universal memcomputing machine}$
(UMM) and the $\textit{digital memcomputing machine}$ (DMM) are discussed. We
review the memcomputing concept in the dynamical systems framework and assess
the algorithms offered for computing $NP$ problems in the UMM and DMM
paradigms. We argue that the UMM is a physically implausible machine, and that
the DMM model, as described by numerical simulations, is no more powerful than
Turing-complete computation. We claim that the evidence for the resolution of
$P$ vs. $NP$ is therefore inconclusive, and conclude that the memcomputing
machine paradigm constitutes an energy efficient, special-purpose class of
models of dynamical systems computation.
"
877,"Statistical Analysis of Time-Variant Channels in Diffusive Mobile
  Molecular Communications","  In this paper, we consider a diffusive mobile molecular communication (MC)
system consisting of a pair of mobile transmitter and receiver nano-machines
suspended in a fluid medium, where we model the mobility of the nano-machines
by Brownian motion. The transmitter and receiver nano-machines exchange
information via diffusive signaling molecules. Due to the random movements of
the transmitter and receiver nano-machines, the statistics of the channel
impulse response (CIR) change over time. We introduce a statistical framework
for characterization of the impulse response of time-variant MC channels. In
particular, we derive closed-form analytical expressions for the mean and the
autocorrelation function of the impulse response of the channel. Given the
autocorrelation function, we define the coherence time of the time-variant MC
channel as a metric that characterizes the variations of the impulse response.
Furthermore, we derive an analytical expression for evaluation of the expected
error probability of a simple detector for the considered system. In order to
investigate the impact of CIR decorrelation over time, we compare the
performances of a detector with perfect channel state information (CSI)
knowledge and a detector with outdated CSI knowledge. The accuracy of the
proposed analytical expression is verified via particle-based simulation of the
Brownian motion.
"
878,Computing with Networks of Nonlinear Mechanical Oscillators,"  As it is getting increasingly difficult to achieve gains in the density and
power efficiency of microelectronic computing devices because of lithographic
techniques reaching fundamental physical limits, new approaches are required to
maximize the benefits of distributed sensors, micro-robots or smart materials.
Biologically-inspired devices, such as artificial neural networks, can process
information with a high level of parallelism to efficiently solve difficult
problems, even when implemented using conventional microelectronic
technologies. We describe a mechanical device, which operates in a manner
similar to artificial neural networks, to solve efficiently two difficult
benchmark problems (computing the parity of a bit stream, and classifying
spoken words). The device consists in a network of masses coupled by linear
springs and attached to a substrate by non-linear springs, thus forming a
network of anharmonic oscillators. As the masses can directly couple to forces
applied on the device, this approach combines sensing and computing functions
in a single power-efficient device with compact dimensions.
"
879,DNA Hairpin Gate: A Renewable DNA Seesaw Motif Using Hairpins,"  In 2011 the DNA seesaw gate motif was introduced. It is a powerful
feed-forward DNA nanodevice that can perform digital logic computations. The
landmark of that work managed to evaluate moderately large Boolean circuits by
cascading multiple DNA seesaw gates. Although the design is robust in solution
and scalable, it is designed for one time use and is not reusable. This
prevents pursuing important applications such as feedback and sequential
digital circuits. We present a novel design for DNA nanodevices that can
perform digital logic computations and are furthermore renewable. First, we
modified the prior DNA seesaw gate motif into a hairpin. We call the resulting
motif a DNA hairpin-seesaw gate. We show the feed-forward digital computation
reaction imitates the seesaw gate motif. Second, we added a reporting phase
that provides increased scalability to our device. Third, we designed input and
fuel extracting hairpins that when added, initiate a renewing process. This
results in a renewed functional gate, in its original configuration, which is
able to make a new logical computation with new inputs. Finally, we introduced
a renewable two-input Boolean logic OR gate. After calculating the output of a
certain input set, the circuit is restored and a new set of inputs is
introduced to compute the new output. We provide experimental fluorescent data
on three repeated rounds of executions of our hairpin gate motif and its
restoration, indicating gradual loss of response. Finally, we calculated rate
constants of our experimental data by fitting it to a second order reaction
model using maximum likelihood estimation method.
"
880,Anticipation of digital patterns,"  A memristive device is a novel passive device, which is essentially a
resistor with memory. This device can be utilized for novel technical
applications like neuromorphic computation. In this paper, we focus on
anticipation - a capability of a system to decide how to react in an
environment by predicting future states. Especially, we have designed an
elementary memristive circuit for the anticipation of digital patterns, where
this circuit is based on the capability of an amoeba to anticipate periodically
occurring unipolar pulses. The resulting circuit has been verified by digital
simulations and has been realized in hardware as well. For the practical
realization, we have used an Ag-doped TiO2-x-based memristive device, which has
been fabricated in planar capacitor structures on a silicon wafer. The
functionality of the circuit is shown by simulations and measurements. Finally,
the anticipation of information is demonstrated by using images, where the
robustness of this anticipatory circuit against noise and faulty intermediate
information is visualized.
"
881,"Geometry-Based Optimization of One-Way Quantum Computation Measurement
  Patterns","  In one-way quantum computation (1WQC) model, an initial highly entangled
state called a graph state is used to perform universal quantum computations by
a sequence of adaptive single-qubit measurements and post-measurement Pauli-X
and Pauli-Z corrections. The needed computations are organized as measurement
patterns, or simply patterns, in the 1WQC model. The entanglement operations in
a pattern can be shown by a graph which together with the set of its input and
output qubits is called the geometry of the pattern. Since a one-way quantum
computation pattern is based on quantum measurements, which are fundamentally
nondeterministic evolutions, there must be conditions over geometries to
guarantee determinism. Causal flow is a sufficient and generalized flow (gflow)
is a necessary and sufficient condition over geometries to identify a
dependency structure for the measurement sequences in order to achieve
determinism. Previously, three optimization methods have been proposed to
simplify 1WQC patterns which are called standardization, signal shifting and
Pauli simplification. These optimizations can be performed using measurement
calculus formalism by rewriting rules. However, maintaining and searching these
rules in the library can be complicated with respect to implementation.
Moreover, serial execution of these rules is time consuming due to executing
many ineffective commutation rules. To overcome this problem, in this paper, a
new scheme is proposed to perform optimization techniques on patterns with flow
or gflow only based on their geometries instead of using rewriting rules.
Furthermore, the proposed scheme obtains the maximally delayed gflow order for
geometries with flow. It is shown that the time complexity of the proposed
approach is improved over the previous ones.
"
882,Towards Reverse Engineering Reversible Logic,"  Reversible logic has two main properties. First, the number of inputs is
equal to the number of outputs. Second, it implements a one-to-one mapping;
i.e., one can reconstruct the inputs from the outputs. These properties enable
its applications in building quantum computing architectures.
  In this paper, we study reverse engineering of reversible logic circuits,
including reverse engineering of non-reversible functions embedded into
reversible circuits. We propose the number of embeddings of non-reversible
functions into a reversible circuit as the security metric for reverse
engineering. We analyze the security benefits of automatic synthesis of
reversible circuits. We use our proposed security metric to show that the
functional synthesis approaches yield reversible circuits that are more
resilient to reverse engineering than the structural synthesis approaches.
Finally, we propose scrambling of the inputs and outputs of a reversible
circuit to thwart reverse engineering.
"
883,"Energy-Efficient Low-Power Circuit Techniques for Wireless Energy and
  Data Transfer in IoT Sensor Nodes","  In this paper, we present techniques and examples to reduce power consumption
and increase energy efficiency of autonomous Wireless Sensor Nodes (WSNs) for
the Internet of Things. We focus on the RF Energy Harvester (RFEH), the data
receiver and the transmitter, all of which have a large impact on the device
cost, lifetime and functionality. Co-design of the antenna and the electronics
is explored to boost the power conversion efficiency of the RF-DC converter. As
a proof of principle, a charge pump rectifier is designed, and its measurement
results are presented. To boost the rectifier output voltage, a DC-DC converter
that employs maximum power point tracking has been designed. A prototype
circuit is also presented that can accommodate an input power level range of 1
{\mu}W to 1 mW and offers peak efficiencies of 76.3% and 82% at 1 {\mu}W and 1
mW, respectively. The co-design principle is also used at the receiver side
where the antenna-electronics interface is optimized. It is shown how this
technique allows improving the noise figure of the Low Noise Amplifier (LNA)
without sacrificing power consumption. As a low power alternative to
narrow-band wireless transmission, sub-GHz ultra-wideband is proposed. As a
proof of principle, the design of a novel low-power sub-GHz
Ultra-Wide-Bandwidth (UWB) transmitter which consumes only 0.28 mW is
presented. Its working principle is verified by means of circuit simulations
and measurements. The low power nature of the transmitter and receiver
principles, combined with the power efficient RF-DC converter paves the way
towards the continuous operation of a WSN.
"
884,Information transmission and signal permutation in active flow networks,"  Recent experiments show that both natural and artificial microswimmers in
narrow channel-like geometries will self-organise to form steady, directed
flows. This suggests that networks of flowing active matter could function as
novel autonomous microfluidic devices. However, little is known about how
information propagates through these far-from-equilibrium systems. Through a
mathematical analogy with spin-ice vertex models, we investigate here the
input-output characteristics of generic incompressible active flow networks
(AFNs). Our analysis shows that information transport through an AFN is
inherently different from conventional pressure or voltage driven networks.
Active flows on hexagonal arrays preserve input information over longer
distances than their passive counterparts and are highly sensitive to bulk
topological defects, whose presence can be inferred from marginal input-output
distributions alone. This sensitivity further allows controlled permutations on
parallel inputs, revealing an unexpected link between active matter and group
theory that can guide new microfluidic mixing strategies facilitated by active
matter and aid the design of generic autonomous information transport networks.
"
885,"Fluorescent Troffer-powered Internet of Things: An Experimental Study of
  Electric-field Energy Harvesting","  A totally new energy harvesting architecture that exploits ambient
electric-field (E-field) emitting from fluorescent light fixtures is presented.
A copper plate, 50 x 50 cm in size, is placed in between the ambient field to
extract energy by capacitive coupling. A low voltage prototype is designed,
structured and tested on a conventional ceiling-type 4-light fluorescent
troffer operating in 50 Hz 220 V AC power grid. It is examined that the
harvester is able to collect roughly 1.25 J of energy in 25 min when a 0.1 F of
super-capacitor is employed. The equivalent circuit and the physical model of
the proposed harvesting paradigm are provided, and the attainable power is
evaluated in both theoretical and experimental manner. The scavenged energy is
planned to be utilized for building battery-less Internet of Things (IoT)
networks that are obliged to sense environmental parameters, analyze the
gathered data, and remotely inform a higher authority within predefined
periods.
"
886,Channel Estimation for Diffusive MIMO Molecular Communications,"  In diffusion-based communication, as for molecular systems, the achievable
data rate is very low due to the slow nature of diffusion and the existence of
severe inter-symbol interference (ISI). Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
technique can be used to improve the data rate. Knowledge of channel impulse
response (CIR) is essential for equalization and detection in MIMO systems.
This paper presents a training-based CIR estimation for diffusive MIMO (D-MIMO)
channels. Maximum likelihood and least-squares estimators are derived, and the
training sequences are designed to minimize the corresponding Cram\'er-Rao
bound. Sub-optimal estimators are compared to Cram\'er-Rao bound to validate
their performance.
"
887,Improving the Accuracy of an Adiabatic Quantum Computer,"  The purpose of the D-Wave adiabatic quantum computer is to find a set of
qubit values that minimize its objective function. For various reasons, the set
of qubit values returned by the D-Wave has errors. This paper presents a method
of improving the results returned by the D-Wave. The method individually
modifies the qubit values returned by the D-Wave to find a set of values which
is a minimum of the objective function. That set however is not necessarily
guaranteed to be a global minimum. The method is simple and easily incorporated
into any algorithm that has direct access to the sets of values returned by the
D-Wave. Examples are also presented that demonstrate the merit of using such a
sample improvement method.
"
888,Hardware emulation of stochastic p-bits for invertible logic,"  The common feature of nearly all logic and memory devices is that they make
use of stable units to represent 0's and 1's. A completely different paradigm
is based on three-terminal stochastic units which could be called ""p-bits"",
where the output is a random telegraphic signal continuously fluctuating
between 0 and 1 with a tunable mean. p-bits can be interconnected to receive
weighted contributions from others in a network, and these weighted
contributions can be chosen to not only solve problems of optimization and
inference but also to implement precise Boolean functions in an inverted mode.
This inverted operation of Boolean gates is particularly striking: They provide
inputs consistent to a given output along with unique outputs to a given set of
inputs. The existing demonstrations of accurate invertible logic are
intriguing, but will these striking properties observed in computer simulations
carry over to hardware implementations? This paper uses individual micro
controllers to emulate p-bits, and we present results for a 4-bit ripple carry
adder with 48 p-bits and a 4-bit multiplier with 46 p-bits working in inverted
mode as a factorizer. Our results constitute a first step towards implementing
p-bits with nano devices, like stochastic Magnetic Tunnel Junctions.
"
889,"Exploiting OxRAM Resistive Switching for Dynamic Range Improvement of
  CMOS Image Sensors","  We present a unique application of OxRAM devices in CMOS Image Sensors (CIS)
for dynamic range (DR) improvement. We propose a modified 3T-APS (Active Pixel
Sensor) circuit that incorporates OxRAM in 1T-1R configuration. DR improvement
is achieved by resistive compression of the pixel output signal through
autonomous programming of OxRAM device resistance during exposure. We show that
by carefully preconditioning the OxRAM resistance, pixel DR can be enhanced.
Detailed impact of OxRAM SET-to-RESET and RESET-to-SET transitions on pixel DR
is discussed. For experimental validation with specific OxRAM preprogrammed
states, a 4 Kb 10 nm thick HfOx (1T-1R) matrix was fabricated and
characterized. Best case, relative pixel DR improvement of ~ 50 dB was obtained
for our design.
"
890,Resistive communications based on neuristors,"  Memristors are passive elements that allow us to store information using a
single element per bit. However, this is not the only utility of the memristor.
Considering the physical chemical structure of the element used, the memristor
can function at the same time as memory and as a communication unit. This paper
presents a new approach to the use of the memristor and develops the concept of
resistive communication.
"
891,"Synthesis and Optimization of Multi-Objective Multi-Output QCA Circuit
  using Genetic Algorithm","  The physical limitations of CMOS technology triggered several research for
finding an alternative technology. QCA is one of the emerging nanotechnologies
which is gaining attention as a substitute of CMOS. The main potential of QCA
is its ultra low power consumption, less area overhead, and high speed.
Majority and inverter gates are the basic gates in QCA,which together works as
a universal logic gate to implement any QCA circuit. This paper proposes an
efficient methodology for optimal QCA circuit synthesis of arbitrary
multi-output boolean functions. A multi-objective genetic algorithm based
approach is used to reduce worst case delay and gate count of a QCA circuit.
Different importance is given to worst case delay, no. of majority and no. of
inverter gates. Several efficient techniques are used in order to achieve the
optimal result and reduce the computational complexity furthermore additional
methodologies are used to eliminate redundancies from the final solution.
Comparison of the obtained results with the existing best techniques indicates,
the proposed technique outperforms in terms of worst case delay and gate count.
"
892,Storage and Caching: Synthesis of Flow-based Microfluidic Biochips,"  Flow-based microfluidic biochips are widely used in lab- on-a-chip
experiments. In these chips, devices such as mixers and detectors connected by
micro-channels execute specific operations. Intermediate fluid samples are
saved in storage temporarily until target devices become avail- able. However,
if the storage unit does not have enough capacity, fluid samples must wait in
devices, reducing their efficiency and thus increasing the overall execution
time. Consequently, storage and caching of fluid samples in such microfluidic
chips must be considered during synthesis to balance execution efficiency and
chip area.
"
893,"Novel CMOS RFIC Layout Generation with Concurrent Device Placement and
  Fixed-Length Microstrip Routing","  With advancing process technologies and booming IoT markets, millimeter-wave
CMOS RFICs have been widely developed in re- cent years. Since the performance
of CMOS RFICs is very sensi- tive to the precision of the layout, precise
placement of devices and precisely matched microstrip lengths to given values
have been a labor-intensive and time-consuming task, and thus become a major
bottleneck for time to market. This paper introduces a progressive
integer-linear-programming-based method to gener- ate high-quality RFIC layouts
satisfying very stringent routing requirements of microstrip lines, including
spacing/non-crossing rules, precise length, and bend number minimization,
within a given layout area. The resulting RFIC layouts excel in both per-
formance and area with much fewer bends compared with the simulation-tuning
based manual layout, while the layout gener- ation time is significantly
reduced from weeks to half an hour.
"
894,Testing Microfluidic Fully Programmable Valve Arrays (FPVAs),"  Fully Programmable Valve Array (FPVA) has emerged as a new architecture for
the next-generation flow-based microfluidic biochips. This 2D-array consists of
regularly-arranged valves, which can be dynamically configured by users to
realize microfluidic devices of different shapes and sizes as well as
interconnections. Additionally, the regularity of the underlying structure
renders FPVAs easier to integrate on a tiny chip. However, these arrays may
suffer from various manufacturing defects such as blockage and leakage in
control and flow channels. Unfortunately, no efficient method is yet known for
testing such a general-purpose architecture. In this paper, we present a novel
formulation using the concept of flow paths and cut-sets, and describe an
ILP-based hierarchical strategy for generating compact test sets that can
detect multiple faults in FPVAs. Simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of
the proposed method in detecting manufacturing faults with only a small number
of test vectors.
"
895,"Transport or Store? Synthesizing Flow-based Microfluidic Biochips using
  Distributed Channel Storage","  Flow-based microfluidic biochips have attracted much atten- tion in the EDA
community due to their miniaturized size and execution efficiency. Previous
research, however, still follows the traditional computing model with a
dedicated storage unit, which actually becomes a bottleneck of the performance
of bio- chips. In this paper, we propose the first architectural synthe- sis
framework considering distributed storage constructed tem- porarily from
transportation channels to cache fluid samples. Since distributed storage can
be accessed more efficiently than a dedicated storage unit and channels can
switch between the roles of transportation and storage easily, biochips with
this dis- tributed computing architecture can achieve a higher execution
efficiency even with fewer resources. Experimental results con- firm that the
execution efficiency of a bioassay can be improved by up to 28% while the
number of valves in the biochip can be reduced effectively.

896,"A discussion about LNG Experiment: Irreversible or Reversible Generation
  of the OR Logic Gate?","  In a recent paper M. Lopez-Suarez, I. Neri, and L. Gammaitoni (LNG) present a
concrete realization of the Boolean OR irreversible gate, but contrary to the
standard Landauer principle, with an arbitrary small dissipation of energy. A
Popperian good falsification! In this paper we discuss a theoretical
description of the LNG device which is indeed a 3in/3out self--reversible
realization of the involved OR gate, satisfying in this way the Landauer
principle of no dispersion of energy, contrary to the LNG conclusions. The
different point of view is due to a different interpretation of the two outputs
corresponding to the inputs 10 and 01, which are considered by LNG
indistinguishable so producing a non reversible realization of the standard
2in/1out gate. On the contrary, always considering these two outputs
indistinguishable, by a suitable normalization function of the cantilever
angles, the experimental results obtained by the LNG device coincide with the
OR connective obtained from the third output of the self-reversible 3in/3out CL
gate by the Inputs-Ancilla->Garbage-Output procedure. Thus, by the
self-reversibility this realization is without dissipation of energy according
to the Landauer principle. Furthermore, using the self-reversible Toffoli gate
it is possible to obtain from the LNG device the realization of the connective
AND adopting another normalization function on the cantilever angles. Finally,
by other suitable normalization procedures on cantilever angles it is possible
to obtain also the other logic NOR and NAND connectives, and in a more
sophisticated way the XOR and NXOR connectives in a self-reversible way. All
this leads to introduce a universal logic machine consisting of the LNG device
plus a memory containing all the necessary angle normalization functions to
produce in a self-reversible way, by choosing one of these latter, the logic
connectives now listed.

897,"Wearable Health Monitoring Using Capacitive Voltage-Mode Human Body
  Communication","  Rapid miniaturization and cost reduction of computing, along with the
availability of wearable and implantable physiological sensors have led to the
growth of human Body Area Network (BAN) formed by a network of such sensors and
computing devices. One promising application of such a network is wearable
health monitoring where the collected data from the sensors would be
transmitted and analyzed to assess the health of a person. Typically, the
devices in a BAN are connected through wireless (WBAN), which suffers from
energy inefficiency due to the high-energy consumption of wireless
transmission. Human Body Communication (HBC) uses the relatively low loss human
body as the communication medium to connect these devices, promising order(s)
of magnitude better energy-efficiency and built-in security compared to WBAN.
In this paper, we demonstrate a health monitoring device and system built using
Commercial-Off-The- Shelf (COTS) sensors and components, that can collect data
from physiological sensors and transmit it through a) intra-body HBC to another
device (hub) worn on the body or b) upload health data through HBC-based
human-machine interaction to an HBC capable machine. The system design
constraints and signal transfer characteristics for the implemented HBC-based
wearable health monitoring system are measured and analyzed, showing reliable
connectivity with >8x power savings compared to Bluetooth lowenergy (BTLE).

898,"Voltage-Driven Domain-Wall Motion based Neuro-Synaptic Devices for
  Dynamic On-line Learning","  Conventional von-Neumann computing models have achieved remarkable feats for
the past few decades. However, they fail to deliver the required efficiency for
certain basic tasks like image and speech recognition when compared to
biological systems. As such, taking cues from biological systems, novel
computing paradigms are being explored for efficient hardware implementations
of recognition/classification tasks. The basic building blocks of such
neuromorphic systems are neurons and synapses. Towards that end, we propose a
leaky-integrate-fire (LIF) neuron and a programmable non-volatile synapse using
domain wall motion induced by magneto-electric effect. Due to a strong elastic
pinning between the ferro-magnetic domain wall (FM-DW) and the underlying
ferro-electric domain wall (FE-DW), the FM-DW gets dragged by the FE-DW on
application of a voltage pulse. The fact that FE materials are insulators
allows for pure voltage-driven FM-DW motion, which in turn can be used to mimic
the behaviors of biological spiking neurons and synapses. The voltage driven
nature of the proposed devices allows energy-efficient operation. A detailed
device to system level simulation framework based on micromagnetic simulations
has been developed to analyze the feasibility of the proposed neuro-synaptic
devices. We also demonstrate that the energy-efficient voltage-controlled
behavior of the proposed devices make them suitable for dynamic on-line and
lifelong learning in spiking neural networks (SNNs).
"
899,"Capacity of Molecular Channels with Imperfect Particle-Intensity
  Modulation and Detection","  This work introduces the particle-intensity channel (PIC) as a model for
molecular communication systems and characterizes the properties of the optimal
input distribution and the capacity limits for this system. In the PIC, the
transmitter encodes information, in symbols of a given duration, based on the
number of particles released, and the receiver detects and decodes the message
based on the number of particles detected during the symbol interval. In this
channel, the transmitter may be unable to control precisely the number of
particles released, and the receiver may not detect all the particles that
arrive. We demonstrate that the optimal input distribution for this channel
always has mass points at zero and the maximum number of particles that can be
released. We then consider diffusive particle transport, derive the capacity
expression when the input distribution is binary, and show conditions under
which the binary input is capacity-achieving. In particular, we demonstrate
that when the transmitter cannot generate particles at a high rate, the optimal
input distribution is binary.
"
900,Detection Algorithms for Communication Systems Using Deep Learning,"  The design and analysis of communication systems typically rely on the
development of mathematical models that describe the underlying communication
channel, which dictates the relationship between the transmitted and the
received signals. However, in some systems, such as molecular communication
systems where chemical signals are used for transfer of information, it is not
possible to accurately model this relationship. In these scenarios, because of
the lack of mathematical channel models, a completely new approach to design
and analysis is required. In this work, we focus on one important aspect of
communication systems, the detection algorithms, and demonstrate that by
borrowing tools from deep learning, it is possible to train detectors that
perform well, without any knowledge of the underlying channel models. We
evaluate these algorithms using experimental data that is collected by a
chemical communication platform, where the channel model is unknown and
difficult to model analytically. We show that deep learning algorithms perform
significantly better than a simple detector that was used in previous works,
which also did not assume any knowledge of the channel.
"
901,"Compiling quantum circuits to realistic hardware architectures using
  temporal planners","  To run quantum algorithms on emerging gate-model quantum hardware, quantum
circuits must be compiled to take into account constraints on the hardware. For
near-term hardware, with only limited means to mitigate decoherence, it is
critical to minimize the duration of the circuit. We investigate the
application of temporal planners to the problem of compiling quantum circuits
to newly emerging quantum hardware. While our approach is general, we focus on
compiling to superconducting hardware architectures with nearest neighbor
constraints. Our initial experiments focus on compiling Quantum Alternating
Operator Ansatz (QAOA) circuits whose high number of commuting gates allow
great flexibility in the order in which the gates can be applied. That freedom
makes it more challenging to find optimal compilations but also means there is
a greater potential win from more optimized compilation than for less flexible
circuits. We map this quantum circuit compilation problem to a temporal
planning problem, and generated a test suite of compilation problems for QAOA
circuits of various sizes to a realistic hardware architecture. We report
compilation results from several state-of-the-art temporal planners on this
test set. This early empirical evaluation demonstrates that temporal planning
is a viable approach to quantum circuit compilation.
"
902,"Shorter stabilizer circuits via Bruhat decomposition and quantum circuit
  transformations","  In this paper we improve the layered implementation of arbitrary stabilizer
circuits introduced by Aaronson and Gottesman in Phys. Rev. A 70(052328), 2004:
to obtain a general stabilizer circuit, we reduce their $11$-stage computation
-H-C-P-C-P-C-H-P-C-P-C- over the gate set consisting of Hadamard,
Controlled-NOT, and Phase gates, into a $7$-stage computation of the form
-C-CZ-P-H-P-CZ-C-. We show arguments in support of using -CZ- stages over the
-C- stages: not only the use of -CZ- stages allows a shorter layered
expression, but -CZ- stages are simpler and appear to be easier to implement
compared to the -C- stages. Based on this decomposition, we develop a two-qubit
gate depth-$(14n{-}4)$ implementation of stabilizer circuits over the gate
library $\{$H, P, CNOT$\}$, executable in the Linear Nearest Neighbor (LNN)
architecture, improving best previously known depth-$25n$ circuit, also
executable in the LNN architecture. Our constructions rely on Bruhat
decomposition of the symplectic group and on folding arbitrarily long sequences
of the form $($-P-C-$)^m$ into a 3-stage computation -P-CZ-C-. Our results
include the reduction of the $11$-stage decomposition -H-C-P-C-P-C-H-P-C-P-C-
into a $9$-stage decomposition of the form -C-P-C-P-H-C-P-C-P-. This reduction
is based on the Bruhat decomposition of the symplectic group. This result also
implies a new normal form for stabilizer circuits. We show that a circuit in
this normal form is optimal in the number of Hadamard gates used. We also show
that the normal form has an asymptotically optimal number of parameters.
"
903,On dynamics of excitation in F-actin: automaton model,"  We represent a filamentous actin molecule as a graph of finite-state machines
(F-actin automaton). Each node in the graph takes three states --- resting,
excited, refractory. All nodes update their states simultaneously and by the
same rule, in discrete time steps. Two rules are considered: threshold rule ---
a resting node is excited if it has at least one excited neighbour and narrow
excitation interval rule --- a resting node is excited if it has exactly one
excited neighbour. We analyse distributions of transient periods and lengths of
limit cycles in evolution of F-actin automaton, propose mechanisms for
formation of limit cycles and evaluate density of information storage in
F-actin automata.
"
904,Temporal correlation detection using computational phase-change memory,"  For decades, conventional computers based on the von Neumann architecture
have performed computation by repeatedly transferring data between their
processing and their memory units, which are physically separated. As
computation becomes increasingly data-centric and as the scalability limits in
terms of performance and power are being reached, alternative computing
paradigms are searched for in which computation and storage are collocated. A
fascinating new approach is that of computational memory where the physics of
nanoscale memory devices are used to perform certain computational tasks within
the memory unit in a non-von Neumann manner. Here we present a large-scale
experimental demonstration using one million phase-change memory devices
organized to perform a high-level computational primitive by exploiting the
crystallization dynamics. Also presented is an application of such a
computational memory to process real-world data-sets. The results show that
this co-existence of computation and storage at the nanometer scale could be
the enabler for new, ultra-dense, low power, and massively parallel computing
systems.
"
905,Practical Integer-to-Binary Mapping for Quantum Annealers,"  Recent advancements in quantum annealing hardware and numerous studies in
this area suggests that quantum annealers have the potential to be effective in
solving unconstrained binary quadratic programming problems. Naturally, one may
desire to expand the application domain of these machines to problems with
general discrete variables. In this paper, we explore the possibility of
employing quantum annealers to solve unconstrained quadratic programming
problems over a bounded integer domain. We present an approach for encoding
integer variables into binary ones, thereby representing unconstrained integer
quadratic programming problems as unconstrained binary quadratic programming
problems. To respect some of the limitations of the currently developed quantum
annealers, we propose an integer encoding, named bounded- coefficient encoding,
in which we limit the size of the coefficients that appear in the encoding.
Furthermore, we propose an algorithm for finding the upper bound on the
coefficients of the encoding using the precision of the machine and the
coefficients of the original integer problem. Finally, we experimentally show
that this approach is far more resilient to the noise of the quantum annealers
compared to traditional approaches for the encoding of integers in base two.
"
906,Logic Synthesis for Quantum Computing,"  We present a synthesis framework to map logic networks into quantum circuits
for quantum computing. The synthesis framework is based on LUT networks
(lookup-table networks), which play a key role in conventional logic synthesis.
Establishing a connection between LUTs in a LUT network and reversible
single-target gates in a reversible network allows us to bridge conventional
logic synthesis with logic synthesis for quantum computing, despite several
fundamental differences. We call our synthesis framework LUT-based Hierarchical
Reversible Logic Synthesis (LHRS). Input to LHRS is a classical logic network;
output is a quantum network (realized in terms of Clifford+$T$ gates). The
framework offers to trade-off the number of qubits for the number of quantum
gates. In a first step, an initial network is derived that only consists of
single-target gates and already completely determines the number of qubits in
the final quantum network. Different methods are then used to map each
single-target gate into Clifford+$T$ gates, while aiming at optimally using
available resources. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in
automatically synthesizing IEEE compliant floating point networks up to double
precision. As many quantum algorithms target scientific simulation
applications, they can make rich use of floating point arithmetic components.
But due to the lack of quantum circuit descriptions for those components, it
can be difficult to find a realistic cost estimation for the algorithms. Our
synthesized benchmarks provide cost estimates that allow quantum algorithm
designers to provide the first complete cost estimates for a host of quantum
algorithms. Thus, the benchmarks and, more generally, the LHRS framework are an
essential step towards the goal of understanding which quantum algorithms will
be practical in the first generations of quantum computers.
"
907,"Demystifying the Characteristics of 3D-Stacked Memories: A Case Study
  for Hybrid Memory Cube","  Three-dimensional (3D)-stacking technology, which enables the integration of
DRAM and logic dies, offers high bandwidth and low energy consumption. This
technology also empowers new memory designs for executing tasks not
traditionally associated with memories. A practical 3D-stacked memory is Hybrid
Memory Cube (HMC), which provides significant access bandwidth and low power
consumption in a small area. Although several studies have taken advantage of
the novel architecture of HMC, its characteristics in terms of latency and
bandwidth or their correlation with temperature and power consumption have not
been fully explored. This paper is the first, to the best of our knowledge, to
characterize the thermal behavior of HMC in a real environment using the AC-510
accelerator and to identify temperature as a new limitation for this
state-of-the-art design space. Moreover, besides bandwidth studies, we
deconstruct factors that contribute to latency and reveal their sources for
high- and low-load accesses. The results of this paper demonstrates essential
behaviors and performance bottlenecks for future explorations of
packet-switched and 3D-stacked memories.
"
908,"Neutron-induced strike: Study of multiple node charge collection in 14nm
  FinFETs","  FinFETs have replaced the conventional bulk CMOS transistors in the sub-20nm
technology. One of the key issues to consider is, the vulnerability of FinFET
based circuits to multiple node charge collection due to neutron-induced
strikes. In this paper, we perform a device simulation based characterization
study on representative layouts of 14nm bulk FinFETs in order to study the
extent to which multiple transistors are affected. We find that multiple
transistors do get affected and the impact can last up to five transistors away
(~200nm). We show that the potential of source/drain regions in the
neighborhood of the strike is a significant contributing factor. In the case of
multi-fin FinFETs, the charge collected per fin is seen to reduce as the number
of fins increase. Thus, smaller FinFETs are susceptible to high amounts of
charge collection.
"
909,"Improved reversible and quantum circuits for Karatsuba-based integer
  multiplication","  Integer arithmetic is the underpinning of many quantum algorithms, with
applications ranging from Shor's algorithm over HHL for matrix inversion to
Hamiltonian simulation algorithms. A basic objective is to keep the required
resources to implement arithmetic as low as possible. This applies in
particular to the number of qubits required in the implementation as for the
foreseeable future this number is expected to be small. We present a reversible
circuit for integer multiplication that is inspired by Karatsuba's recursive
method. The main improvement over circuits that have been previously reported
in the literature is an asymptotic reduction of the amount of space required
from $O(n^{1.585})$ to $O(n^{1.427})$. This improvement is obtained in exchange
for a small constant increase in the number of operations by a factor less than
$2$ and a small asymptotic increase in depth for the parallel version. The
asymptotic improvement are obtained from analyzing pebble games on complete
ternary trees.
"
910,Spatial Coding Techniques for Molecular MIMO,"  This paper studies spatial diversity techniques applied to multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) diffusion-based molecular communications (DBMC). Two
types of spatial coding techniques, namely Alamouti-type coding and repetition
MIMO coding are suggested and analyzed. In addition, we consider receiver-side
equal-gain combining, which is equivalent to maximum-ratio combining in
symmetrical scenarios. For numerical analysis, the channel impulse responses of
a symmetrical $2 \times 2$ MIMO-DBMC system are acquired by a trained
artificial neural network. It is demonstrated that spatial diversity has the
potential to improve the system performance and that repetition MIMO coding
outperforms Alamouti-type coding.
"
911,"Personal Food Computer: A new device for controlled-environment
  agriculture","  Due to their interdisciplinary nature, devices for controlled-environment
agriculture have the possibility to turn into ideal tools not only to conduct
research on plant phenology but also to create curricula in a wide range of
disciplines. Controlled-environment devices are increasing their
functionalities as well as improving their accessibility. Traditionally,
building one of these devices from scratch implies knowledge in fields such as
mechanical engineering, digital electronics, programming, and energy
management. However, the requirements of an effective controlled environment
device for personal use brings new constraints and challenges. This paper
presents the OpenAg Personal Food Computer (PFC); a low cost desktop size
platform, which not only targets plant phenology researchers but also
hobbyists, makers, and teachers from elementary to high-school levels (K-12).
The PFC is completely open-source and it is intended to become a tool that can
be used for collective data sharing and plant growth analysis. Thanks to its
modular design, the PFC can be used in a large spectrum of activities.
"
912,T-count Optimized Design of Quantum Integer Multiplication,"  Quantum circuits of many qubits are extremely difficult to realize; thus, the
number of qubits is an important metric in a quantum circuit design. Further,
scalable and reliable quantum circuits are based on Clifford + T gates. An
efficient quantum circuit saves quantum hardware resources by reducing the
number of T gates without substantially increasing the number of qubits.
Recently, the design of a quantum multiplier is presented by Babu [1] which
improves the existing works in terms of number of quantum gates, number of
qubits, and delay. However, the recent design is not based on fault-tolerant
Clifford + T gates. Also, it has large number of qubits and garbage outputs.
Therefore, this work presents a T-count optimized quantum circuit for integer
multiplication with only $4 \cdot n + 1$ qubits and no garbage outputs. The
proposed quantum multiplier design saves the T-count by using a novel quantum
conditional adder circuit. Also, where one operand to the controlled adder is
zero, the conditional adder is replaced with a Toffoli gate array to further
save the T gates. To have fair comparison with the recent design by Babu and
get an actual estimate of the T-count, it is made garbageless by using
Bennett's garbage removal scheme. The proposed design achieves an average
T-count savings of $47.55\%$ compared to the recent work by Babu. Further,
comparison is also performed with other recent works by Lin et. al. [2], and
Jayashree et. al.[3]. Average T-count savings of $62.71\%$ and $26.30\%$ are
achieved compared to the recent works by Lin et. al., and Jayashree et. al.,
respectively.
"
913,Design of Quantum Circuits for Galois Field Squaring and Exponentiation,"  This work presents an algorithm to generate depth, quantum gate and qubit
optimized circuits for $GF(2^m)$ squaring in the polynomial basis. Further, to
the best of our knowledge the proposed quantum squaring circuit algorithm is
the only work that considers depth as a metric to be optimized. We compared
circuits generated by our proposed algorithm against the state of the art and
determine that they require $50 \%$ fewer qubits and offer gates savings that
range from $37 \%$ to $68 \%$. Further, existing quantum exponentiation are
based on either modular or integer arithmetic. However, Galois arithmetic is a
useful tool to design resource efficient quantum exponentiation circuit
applicable in quantum cryptanalysis. Therefore, we present the quantum circuit
implementation of Galois field exponentiation based on the proposed quantum
Galois field squaring circuit. We calculated a qubit savings ranging between
$44\%$ to $50\%$ and quantum gate savings ranging between $37 \%$ to $68 \%$
compared to identical quantum exponentiation circuit based on existing squaring
circuits.
"
914,"Performance Analysis of Inband FD-D2D Communications with Imperfect SI
  Cancellation for Wireless Video Distribution","  Tremendous growing demand for high data rate services is the main driver for
increasing traffic in wireless cellular networks. Device-to-Device (D2D)
communications have recently been proposed to offload data via direct
communications by bypassing cellular base stations (BSs). Such an offloading
schemes increase capacity and reduce end-to-end delay in cellular networks and
help to serve the dramatically increasing demand for high data rate. In this
paper, we aim to analyze inband fullduplex (FD) D2D performance for the
wireless video distribution by considering imperfect self-interference (SI)
cancellation. Using tools from stochastic geometry, we analyze outage
probability and spectral efficiency. Analytic and simulation results are used
to demonstrate achievable gain against its half-duplex (HD) counterpart.
"
915,Wireless Optogenetic Nanonetworks: Device Model and Charging Protocols,"  In recent years, numerous research efforts have been dedicated towards
developing efficient implantable devices for brain stimulation. However, there
are limitations and challenges with the current technologies. Firstly, the
stimulation of neurons currently is possible through implantable electrodes but
limited to a population of neurons. Secondly, a major hurdle lies in developing
miniature devices that can last for a lifetime in the patient's brain. In
parallel, Optogenetics has emerged proposing the stimulation of neurons using
light by means of optical fibers inserted through the skull. Many challenges
are thus introduced in terms of suitability to patient's lifestyle and
biocompatibility. We have recently proposed the concept of wireless optogenetic
nanonetworking devices (WiOptND), addressing these long-term deployment
problems, and at the same time targeting single neuron stimulation [1]. The
WiOptND is equipped with a miniature LED that is able to stimulate a
genetically engineered neuron while harvesting energy from ultrasonic
vibrations. This paper investigates how light propagates in the brain tissue,
and based on the power required to emit sufficient intensity for stimulation,
an energy harvesting circuitry is designed. A number of charging protocols are
also proposed to maximize energy efficiency while ensuring minimum number of
neural spike misfirings. These protocols include the Charge and Fire, the
Predictive Sliding Detection Window, and its variant Markov-Chain based
Time-Delay Patterns. Simulation results show the drop of stimulation ratio for
25% and more stable trend in its efficiency ratio are exhibited on Markov-Chain
based Time-Delay Patterns compared to Change and Fire. The results show the
feasibility of utilizing WiOptND for long-term implants, and a new direction
towards precise stimulation of neurons in the cortical columns of the brain.
"
916,"Analog CMOS-based Resistive Processing Unit for Deep Neural Network
  Training","  Recently we have shown that an architecture based on resistive processing
unit (RPU) devices has potential to achieve significant acceleration in deep
neural network (DNN) training compared to today's software-based DNN
implementations running on CPU/GPU. However, currently available device
candidates based on non-volatile memory technologies do not satisfy all the
requirements to realize the RPU concept. Here, we propose an analog CMOS-based
RPU design (CMOS RPU) which can store and process data locally and can be
operated in a massively parallel manner. We analyze various properties of the
CMOS RPU to evaluate the functionality and feasibility for acceleration of DNN
training.
"
917,"Quantum resource estimates for computing elliptic curve discrete
  logarithms","  We give precise quantum resource estimates for Shor's algorithm to compute
discrete logarithms on elliptic curves over prime fields. The estimates are
derived from a simulation of a Toffoli gate network for controlled elliptic
curve point addition, implemented within the framework of the quantum computing
software tool suite LIQ$Ui|\rangle$. We determine circuit implementations for
reversible modular arithmetic, including modular addition, multiplication and
inversion, as well as reversible elliptic curve point addition. We conclude
that elliptic curve discrete logarithms on an elliptic curve defined over an
$n$-bit prime field can be computed on a quantum computer with at most $9n +
2\lceil\log_2(n)\rceil+10$ qubits using a quantum circuit of at most $448 n^3
\log_2(n) + 4090 n^3$ Toffoli gates. We are able to classically simulate the
Toffoli networks corresponding to the controlled elliptic curve point addition
as the core piece of Shor's algorithm for the NIST standard curves P-192,
P-224, P-256, P-384 and P-521. Our approach allows gate-level comparisons to
recent resource estimates for Shor's factoring algorithm. The results also
support estimates given earlier by Proos and Zalka and indicate that, for
current parameters at comparable classical security levels, the number of
qubits required to tackle elliptic curves is less than for attacking RSA,
suggesting that indeed ECC is an easier target than RSA.
"
918,"Pay-with-a-Selfie, a human-centred digital payment system","  Mobile payment systems are increasingly used to simplify the way in which
money transfers and transactions can be performed. We argue that, to achieve
their full potential as economic boosters in developing countries, mobile
payment systems need to rely on new metaphors suitable for the business models,
lifestyle, and technology availability conditions of the targeted communities.
The Pay-with-a-Group-Selfie (PGS) project, funded by the Melinda & Bill Gates
Foundation, has developed a micro-payment system that supports everyday small
transactions by extending the reach of, rather than substituting, existing
payment frameworks. PGS is based on a simple gesture and a readily
understandable metaphor. The gesture - taking a selfie - has become part of the
lifestyle of mobile phone users worldwide, including non-technology-savvy ones.
The metaphor likens computing two visual shares of the selfie to ripping a
banknote in two, a technique used for decades for delayed payment in cash-only
markets. PGS is designed to work with devices with limited computational power
and when connectivity is patchy or not always available. Thanks to visual
cryptography techniques PGS uses for computing the shares, the original selfie
can be recomposed simply by stacking the shares, preserving the analogy with
re-joining the two parts of the banknote.
"
919,Advanced Simulation of Quantum Computations,"  Quantum computation is a promising emerging technology which, compared to
conventional computation, allows for substantial speed-ups e.g. for integer
factorization or database search. However, since physical realizations of
quantum computers are in their infancy, a significant amount of research in
this domain still relies on simulations of quantum computations on conventional
machines. This causes a significant complexity which current state-of-the-art
simulators try to tackle with a rather straight forward array-based
representation and by applying massive hardware power. There also exist
solutions based on decision diagrams (i.e. graph-based approaches) that try to
tackle the exponential complexity by exploiting redundancies in quantum states
and operations. However, these existing approaches do not fully exploit
redundancies that are actually present. In this work, we revisit the basics of
quantum computation, investigate how corresponding quantum states and quantum
operations can be represented even more compactly, and, eventually, simulated
in a more efficient fashion. This leads to a new graph-based simulation
approach which outperforms state-of-the-art simulators (array-based as well as
graph-based). Experimental evaluations show that the proposed solution is
capable of simulating quantum computations for more qubits than before, and in
significantly less run-time (several magnitudes faster compared to previously
proposed simulators). An implementation of the proposed simulator is publicly
available online at http://iic.jku.at/eda/research/quantum_simulation.
"
920,Stochastic Spin-Orbit Torque Devices as Elements for Bayesian Inference,"  Probabilistic inference from real-time input data is becoming increasingly
popular and may be one of the potential pathways at enabling cognitive
intelligence. As a matter of fact, preliminary research has revealed that
stochastic functionalities also underlie the spiking behavior of neurons in
cortical microcircuits of the human brain. In tune with such observations,
neuromorphic and other unconventional computing platforms have recently started
adopting the usage of computational units that generate outputs
probabilistically, depending on the magnitude of the input stimulus. In this
work, we experimentally demonstrate a spintronic device that offers a direct
mapping to the functionality of such a controllable stochastic switching
element. We show that the probabilistic switching of Ta/CoFeB/MgO
heterostructures in presence of spin-orbit torque and thermal noise can be
harnessed to enable probabilistic inference in a plethora of unconventional
computing scenarios. This work can potentially pave the way for hardware that
directly mimics the computational units of Bayesian inference.
"
921,Current-mode Memristor Crossbars for Neuromemristive Systems,"  Motivated by advantages of current-mode design, this brief contribution
explores the implementation of weight matrices in neuromemristive systems via
current-mode memristor crossbar circuits. After deriving theoretical results
for the range and distribution of weights in the current-mode design, it is
shown that any weight matrix based on voltage-mode crossbars can be mapped to a
current-mode crossbar if the voltage-mode weights are carefully bounded. Then,
a modified gradient descent rule is derived for the current-mode design that
can be used to perform backpropagation training. Behavioral simulations on the
MNIST dataset indicate that both voltage and current-mode designs are able to
achieve similar accuracy and have similar defect tolerance. However, analysis
of trained weight distributions reveals that current-mode and voltage-mode
designs may use different feature representations.
"
922,"Performance Implications of NoCs on 3D-Stacked Memories: Insights from
  the Hybrid Memory Cube","  Memories that exploit three-dimensional (3D)-stacking technology, which
integrate memory and logic dies in a single stack, are becoming popular. These
memories, such as Hybrid Memory Cube (HMC), utilize a network-on-chip (NoC)
design for connecting their internal structural organizations. This novel usage
of NoC, in addition to aiding processing-in-memory capabilities, enables
numerous benefits such as high bandwidth and memory-level parallelism. However,
the implications of NoCs on the characteristics of 3D-stacked memories in terms
of memory access latency and bandwidth have not been fully explored. This paper
addresses this knowledge gap by (i) characterizing an HMC prototype on the
AC-510 accelerator board and revealing its access latency behaviors, and (ii)
by investigating the implications of such behaviors on system and software
designs.
"
923,Instruction Set Architectures for Quantum Processing Units,"  Progress in quantum computing hardware raises questions about how these
devices can be controlled, programmed, and integrated with existing
computational workflows. We briefly describe several prominent quantum
computational models, their associated quantum processing units (QPUs), and the
adoption of these devices as accelerators within high-performance computing
systems. Emphasizing the interface to the QPU, we analyze instruction set
architectures based on reduced and complex instruction sets, i.e., RISC and
CISC architectures. We clarify the role of conventional constraints on memory
addressing and instruction widths within the quantum computing context.
Finally, we examine existing quantum computing platforms, including the D-Wave
2000Q and IBM Quantum Experience, within the context of future ISA development
and HPC needs.
"
924,Use of global interactions in efficient quantum circuit constructions,"  In this paper we study the ways to use a global entangling operator to
efficiently implement circuitry common to a selection of important quantum
algorithms. In particular, we focus on the circuits composed with global Ising
entangling gates and arbitrary addressable single-qubit gates. We show that
under certain circumstances the use of global operations can substantially
improve the entangling gate count.
"
925,Energy-dissipation Limits in Variance-based Computing,"  Variance-based logic (VBL) uses the fluctuations or the variance in the state
of a particle or a physical quantity to represent different logic levels. In
this letter we show that compared to the traditional bi-stable logic
representation the variance-based representation can theoretically achieve a
superior performance trade-off (in terms of energy dissipation and information
capacity) when operating at fundamental limits imposed by thermal-noise. We
show that for a bi-stable logic device the lower limit on energy dissipated per
bit is 4.35KT/bit, whereas under similar operating conditions, a VBL device
could achieve a lower limit of sub-KT/bit. These theoretical results are
general enough to be applicable to different instantiations and variants of VBL
ranging from digital processors based on energy-scavenging or to processors
based on the emerging valleytronic devices.
"
926,"Adaptive Learning Rule for Hardware-based Deep Neural Networks Using
  Electronic Synapse Devices","  In this paper, we propose a learning rule based on a back-propagation (BP)
algorithm that can be applied to a hardware-based deep neural network (HW-DNN)
using electronic devices that exhibit discrete and limited conductance
characteristics. This adaptive learning rule, which enables forward, backward
propagation, as well as weight updates in hardware, is helpful during the
implementation of power-efficient and high-speed deep neural networks. In
simulations using a three-layer perceptron network, we evaluate the learning
performance according to various conductance responses of electronic synapse
devices and weight-updating methods. It is shown that the learning accuracy is
comparable to that obtained when using a software-based BP algorithm when the
electronic synapse device has a linear conductance response with a high dynamic
range. Furthermore, the proposed unidirectional weight-updating method is
suitable for electronic synapse devices which have nonlinear and finite
conductance responses. Because this weight-updating method can compensate the
demerit of asymmetric weight updates, we can obtain better accuracy compared to
other methods. This adaptive learning rule, which can be applied to full
hardware implementation, can also compensate the degradation of learning
accuracy due to the probable device-to-device variation in an actual electronic

927,Computing via material topology optimisation,"  We construct logical gates via topology optimisation (aimed to solve a
station problem of heat conduction) of a conductive material layout. Values of
logical variables are represented high and low values of a temperature at given
sites. Logical functions are implemented via the formation of an optimum layout
of conductive material between the sites with loading conditions. We implement
AND and XOR gates and a one-bit binary half-adder.
"
928,Spatial Diversity in Molecular Communications,"  In this work, spatial diversity techniques in the area of multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) diffusion-based molecular communications (DBMC) are
investigated. For transmitter-side spatial coding, Alamouti-type coding and
repetition MIMO coding are proposed and analyzed. At the receiver-side,
selection diversity, equal-gain combining, and maximum-ratio combining are
studied as combining strategies. Throughout the numerical analysis, a
symmetrical $2\times 2$ MIMO-DBMC system is assumed. Furthermore, a trained
artificial neural network is utilized to acquire the channel impulse responses.
The numerical analysis demonstrates that it is possible to achieve a diversity
gain in molecular communications. In addition, it is shown that for MIMO-DBMC
systems repetition MIMO coding is superior to Alamouti-type coding.

  Systems","  This technical report deals with the concept of an artificial DNA which
contains a blueprint of the structure and organization of an embedded system.
This blueprint can be used to build up the embedded system in a self-organizing
manner at run-time. The report describes in detail the basic principles of the

future work is described and a conclusion is given.
"
930,Ultra-low-power Wireless Streaming Cameras,"  Wireless video streaming has traditionally been considered an extremely
power-hungry operation. Existing approaches optimize the camera and
communication modules individually to minimize their power consumption.
However, the joint redesign and optimization of wireless communication as well
as the camera is what that provides more power saving. We present an
ultra-low-power wireless video streaming camera. To achieve this, we present a
novel ""analog"" video backscatter technique that feeds analog pixels from the
photo-diodes directly to the backscatter hardware, thereby eliminating power
consuming hardware components such as ADCs and amplifiers. We prototype our
wireless camera using off-the-shelf hardware and show that our design can
stream video at up to 13 FPS and can operate up to a distance of 150 feet from
the access point. Our COTS prototype consumes 2.36mW. Finally, to demonstrate
the potential of our design, we built two proof-of-concept applications: video
streaming for micro-robots and security cameras for face detection.
"
931,Spike sorting using non-volatile metal-oxide memristors,"  Electrophysiological techniques have improved substantially over the past
years to the point that neuroprosthetics applications are becoming viable. This
evolution has been fuelled by the advancement of implantable microelectrode
technologies that have followed their own version of Moore's scaling law.
Similarly to electronics, however, excessive data-rates and strained power
budgets require the development of more efficient computation paradigms for
handling neural data in-situ, in particular the computationally heavy task of
events classification. Here, we demonstrate how the intrinsic analogue
programmability of memristive devices can be exploited to perform
spike-sorting. We then show how combining memristors with standard logic
enables efficient in-silico template matching. Leveraging the physical
properties of nanoscale memristors allows us to implement ultra-compact
analogue circuits for neural signal processing at the power cost of digital.
"
932,"Arithmetic Circuits for Multilevel Qudits Based on Quantum Fourier
  Transform","  We present some basic integer arithmetic quantum circuits, such as adders and
multipliers-accumulators of various forms, as well as diagonal operators, which
operate on multilevel qudits. The integers to be processed are represented in
an alternative basis after they have been Fourier transformed. Several
arithmetic circuits operating on Fourier transformed integers have appeared in
the literature for two level qubits. Here we extend these techniques on
multilevel qudits, as they may offer some advantages relative to qubits
implementations. The arithmetic circuits presented can be used as basic
building blocks for higher level algorithms such as quantum phase estimation,
quantum simulation, quantum optimization etc., but they can also be used in the
implementation of a quantum fractional Fourier transform as it is shown in a
companion work presented separately.
"
933,Two-step approach to scheduling quantum circuits,"  As the effort to scale up existing quantum hardware proceeds, it becomes
necessary to schedule quantum gates in a way that minimizes the number of
operations. There are three constraints that have to be satisfied: the order or
dependency of the quantum gates in the specific algorithm, the fact that any
qubit may be involved in at most one gate at a time, and the restriction that
two-qubit gates are implementable only between connected qubits. The last
aspect implies that the compilation depends not only on the algorithm, but also
on hardware properties like connectivity. Here we suggest a two-step approach
in which logical gates are initially scheduled neglecting connectivity
considerations, while routing operations are added at a later step in a way
that minimizes their overhead. We rephrase the subtasks of gate scheduling in
terms of graph problems like edge-coloring and maximum subgraph isomorphism.
While this approach is general, we specialize to a one dimensional array of
qubits to propose a routing scheme that is minimal in the number of exchange
operations. As a practical application, we schedule the Quantum Approximate
Optimization Algorithm in a linear geometry and quantify the reduction in the
number of gates and circuit depth that results from increasing the efficacy of
the scheduling strategies.
"
934,New Design of Reversible Full Adder/Subtractor using $R$ gate,"  Quantum computers require quantum processors. An important part of the
processor of any computer is the arithmetic unit, which performs binary
addition, subtraction, division and multiplication, however multiplication can
be performed using repeated addition, while division can be performed using
repeated subtraction. In this paper we present two designs using the reversible
$R^3$ gate to perform the quantum half adder/ subtractor and the quantum full
adder/subtractor. The proposed half adder/subtractor design can be used to
perform different logical operations, such as $AND$, $XOR$, $NAND$, $XNOR$,
$NOT$ and copy of basis. The proposed design is compared with the other
previous designs in terms of the number of gates used, the number of constant
bits, the garbage bits, the quantum cost and the delay. The proposed designs
are implemented and tested using GAP software.
"
935,Rank modulation codes for DNA storage,"  Synthesis of DNA molecules offers unprecedented advances in storage
technology. Yet, the microscopic world in which these molecules reside induces
error patterns that are fundamentally different from their digital
counterparts. Hence, to maintain reliability in reading and writing, new coding
schemes must be developed. In a reading technique called shotgun sequencing, a
long DNA string is read in a sliding window fashion, and a profile vector is
produced. It was recently suggested by Kiah et al. that such a vector can
represent the permutation which is induced by its entries, and hence a
rank-modulation scheme arises. Although this interpretation suggests high error
tolerance, it is unclear which permutations are feasible, and how to produce a
DNA string whose profile vector induces a given permutation. In this paper, by
observing some necessary conditions, an upper bound for the number of feasible
permutations is given. Further, a technique for deciding the feasibility of a
permutation is devised. By using insights from this technique, an algorithm for
producing a considerable number of feasible permutations is given, which
applies to any alphabet size and any window length.
"
936,"Combinatorial Optimization by Decomposition on Hybrid CPU--non-CPU
  Solver Architectures","  The advent of new special-purpose hardware such as FPGA or ASIC-based
annealers and quantum processors has shown potential in solving certain
families of complex combinatorial optimization problems more efficiently than
conventional CPUs. We show that to address an industrial optimization problem,
a hybrid architecture of CPUs and non-CPU devices is inevitable. In this paper,
we propose problem decomposition as an effective method for designing a hybrid
CPU--non-CPU optimization solver. We introduce the required algorithmic
elements for making problem decomposition a viable approach in meeting the
real-world constraints such as communication time and the potential higher cost
of using non-CPU hardware. We then turn to the well-known maximum clique
problem, and propose a new method of decomposition for this problem. Our method
enables us to solve the maximum clique problem on very large graphs using
non-CPU hardware that is considerably smaller than the size of the graph. As an
example, we show that the maximum clique problem on the com-Amazon graph, with
334,863 vertices and 925,872 edges, can be solved with a single call to a
device that can embed a fully connected graph of size at least 21 nodes, such
as the D-Wave 2000Q. We also show that our proposed problem decomposition
approach can improve the runtime of two of the best-known classical algorithms
for large, sparse graphs, namely PMC and BBMCSP, by orders of magnitude. In the
light of our study, we believe that new non-CPU hardware that is small in size
could become competitive with CPUs if it could be either mass produced and
highly parallelized, or able to provide high-quality solutions to specific,
small-sized problems significantly faster than CPUs.
"
937,Room-temperature solid state quantum emitters in the telecom range,"  On demand single photon emitters (SPEs) play a key role across a broad range
of quantum technologies, including quantum computation, quantum simulation,
quantum metrology and quantum communications. In quantum networks and quantum
key distribution protocols, where photons are employed as flying qubits,
telecom wavelength operation is preferred due to the reduced fibre loss.
However, despite the tremendous efforts to develop various triggered SPE
platforms, a robust source of triggered SPEs operating at room temperature and
the telecom wavelength is still missing. Here we report a triggered, optically
stable, room temperature solid state SPE operating at telecom wavelengths. The
emitters exhibit high photon purity (~ 5% multiphoton events) and a record-high
brightness of ~ 1.5 MHz. The emission is attributed to localized defects in a
gallium nitride (GaN) crystal. The high performance SPEs embedded in a
technologically mature semiconductor are promising for on-chip quantum
simulators and practical quantum communication technologies.
"
938,Liquid Marble Interaction Gate for Collision-Based Computing,"  Liquid marbles are microlitre droplets of liquid, encapsulated by
self-organised hydrophobic particles at the liquid/air interface. They offer an
efficient approach for manipulating liquid droplets and compartmentalising
reactions in droplets. Digital fluidic devices employing liquid marbles might
benefit from having embedded computing circuits without electronics and moving
mechanical parts (apart from the marbles). We present an experimental
implementation of a collision gate with liquid marbles. Mechanics of the gate
follows principles of Margolus' soft-sphere collision gate. Boolean values of
the inputs are given by the absence (FALSE) or presence (TRUE) of a liquid
marble. There are three outputs: two outputs are trajectories of undisturbed
marbles (they only report TRUE when just one marble is present at one of the
inputs), one output is represented by trajectories of colliding marbles (when
two marbles collide they lose their horizontal momentum and fall), this output
reports TRUE only when two marbles are present at inputs. Thus the gate
implements AND and AND-NOT logical functions. We speculate that by merging
trajectories representing AND-NOT output into a single channel one can produce
a one-bit half-adder. Potential design of a one-bit full-adder is discussed,
and the synthesis of both a pure nickel metal and hybrid nickel/polymer liquid
marble is reported.
"
939,Serverless Protocols for Inventory and Tracking with a UAV,"  It is widely acknowledged that the proliferation of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
(UAVs) may lead to serious concerns regarding avionics safety, particularly
when end-users are not adhering to air safety regulations. There are, however,
domains in which UAVs may help to increase the safety of airplanes and the
management of flights and airport resources that often require substantial
human resources. For instance, Paris Charles de Gaulle airport (CDG) has more
than 7,000 staff and supports 30,000 direct jobs for more than 60 million
passengers per year (as of 2016). Indeed, these new systems can be used
beneficially for several purposes, even in sensitive areas like airports. Among
the considered applications are those that suggest using UAVs to enhance safety
of on-ground airplanes; for instance, by collecting (once the aircraft has
landed) data recorded by different systems during the flight (like the sensors
of the Aircraft Data Networks - ADN) or by examining the state of airplane
structure. In this paper, our proposal is to use UAVs, under the control of the
airport authorities, to inventory and track various tagged assets, such as
luggage, supplies required for the flights, and maintenance tools. The aim of
our proposal is to make airport management systems more efficient for
operations requiring inventory and tracking, along with increasing safety
(sensitive assets such as refueling tanks, or sensitive pieces of luggage can
be tracked), thus raising financial profit.
"
940,"Stochastic IMT (insulator-metal-transition) neurons: An interplay of
  thermal and threshold noise at bifurcation","  Artificial neural networks can harness stochasticity in multiple ways to
enable a vast class of computationally powerful models. Electronic
implementation of such stochastic networks is currently limited to addition of
algorithmic noise to digital machines which is inherently inefficient; albeit
recent efforts to harness physical noise in devices for stochasticity have
shown promise. To succeed in fabricating electronic neuromorphic networks we
need experimental evidence of devices with measurable and controllable
stochasticity which is complemented with the development of reliable
statistical models of such observed stochasticity. Current research literature
has sparse evidence of the former and a complete lack of the latter. This
motivates the current article where we demonstrate a stochastic neuron using an
insulator-metal-transition (IMT) device, based on electrically induced
phase-transition, in series with a tunable resistance. We show that an IMT
neuron has dynamics similar to a piecewise linear FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) neuron
and incorporates all characteristics of a spiking neuron in the device
phenomena. We experimentally demonstrate spontaneous stochastic spiking along
with electrically controllable firing probabilities using Vanadium Dioxide
(VO$_2$) based IMT neurons which show a sigmoid-like transfer function. The
stochastic spiking is explained by two noise sources - thermal noise and
threshold fluctuations, which act as precursors of bifurcation. As such, the
IMT neuron is modeled as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process with a fluctuating
boundary resulting in transfer curves that closely match experiments. As one of
the first comprehensive studies of a stochastic neuron hardware and its
statistical properties, this article would enable efficient implementation of a
large class of neuro-mimetic networks and algorithms.
"
941,Secure Channel for Molecular Communications,"  Molecular communication in nanonetworks is an emerging communication paradigm
that uses molecules as information carriers. Achieving a secure information
exchange is one of the practical challenges that need to be considered to
address the potential of molecular communications in nanonetworks. In this
article, we have introduced secure channel into molecular communications to
prevent eavesdropping. First, we propose a Diffie Hellman algorithm-based
method by which communicating nanomachines can exchange a secret key through
molecular signaling. Then, we use this secret key to perform ciphering. Also,
we present both the algorithm for secret key exchange and the secured molecular
communication system. The proposed secured system is found effective in terms
of energy consumption.
"
942,"Design of Configurable Sequential Circuits in Quantum-dot Cellular
  Automata","  Quantum-dot cellular automata (QCA) is a likely candidate for future low
power nano-scale electronic devices. Sequential circuits in QCA attract more
attention due to its numerous application in digital industry. On the other
hand, configurable devices provide low device cost and efficient utilization of
device area. Since the fundamental building block of any sequential logic
circuit is flip flop, hence constructing configurable, multi-purpose QCA
flip-flops are one of the prime importance of current research. This work
proposes a design of configurable flip-flop (CFF) which is the first of its
kind in QCA domain. The proposed flip-flop can be configured to D, T and JK
flip-flop by configuring its control inputs. In addition, to make more
efficient configurable flip-flop, a clock pulse generator (CPG) is designed
which can trigger all types of edges (falling, rising and dual) of a clock. The
same CFF design is used to realize an edge configurable (dual/rising/falling)
flip- flop with the help of CPG. The biggest advantage of using edge
configurable (dual/rising/falling) flip-flop is that it can be used in 9
different ways using the same single circuit. All the proposed designs are
verified using QCADesigner simulator.
"
943,Design of Adiabatic MTJ-CMOS Hybrid Circuits,"  Low-power designs are a necessity with the increasing demand of portable
devices which are battery operated. In many of such devices the operational
speed is not as important as battery life. Logic-in-memory structures using
nano-devices and adiabatic designs are two methods to reduce the static and
dynamic power consumption respectively. Magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) is an
emerging technology which has many advantages when used in logic-in-memory
structures in conjunction with CMOS. In this paper, we introduce a novel
adiabatic hybrid MTJ/CMOS structure which is used to design AND/NAND, XOR/XNOR
and 1-bit full adder circuits. We simulate the designs using HSPICE with 32nm
CMOS technology and compared it with a non-adiabatic hybrid MTJ/CMOS circuits.
The proposed adiabatic MTJ/CMOS full adder design has more than 7 times lower
power consumtion compared to the previous MTJ/CMOS full adder.
"
944,"An Experimental Microarchitecture for a Superconducting Quantum
  Processor","  Quantum computers promise to solve certain problems that are intractable for
classical computers, such as factoring large numbers and simulating quantum
systems. To date, research in quantum computer engineering has focused
primarily at opposite ends of the required system stack: devising high-level
programming languages and compilers to describe and optimize quantum
algorithms, and building reliable low-level quantum hardware. Relatively little
attention has been given to using the compiler output to fully control the
operations on experimental quantum processors. Bridging this gap, we propose
and build a prototype of a flexible control microarchitecture supporting
quantum-classical mixed code for a superconducting quantum processor. The
microarchitecture is based on three core elements: (i) a codeword-based event
control scheme, (ii) queue-based precise event timing control, and (iii) a
flexible multilevel instruction decoding mechanism for control. We design a set
of quantum microinstructions that allows flexible control of quantum operations
with precise timing. We demonstrate the microarchitecture and microinstruction
set by performing a standard gate-characterization experiment on a transmon
qubit.
"
945,"TraNNsformer: Neural network transformation for memristive crossbar
  based neuromorphic system design","  Implementation of Neuromorphic Systems using post Complementary
Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS) technology based Memristive Crossbar Array
(MCA) has emerged as a promising solution to enable low-power acceleration of
neural networks. However, the recent trend to design Deep Neural Networks
(DNNs) for achieving human-like cognitive abilities poses significant
challenges towards the scalable design of neuromorphic systems (due to the
increase in computation/storage demands). Network pruning [7] is a powerful
technique to remove redundant connections for designing optimally connected
(maximally sparse) DNNs. However, such pruning techniques induce irregular
connections that are incoherent to the crossbar structure. Eventually they
produce DNNs with highly inefficient hardware realizations (in terms of area
and energy). In this work, we propose TraNNsformer - an integrated training
framework that transforms DNNs to enable their efficient realization on
MCA-based systems. TraNNsformer first prunes the connectivity matrix while
forming clusters with the remaining connections. Subsequently, it retrains the
network to fine tune the connections and reinforce the clusters. This is done
iteratively to transform the original connectivity into an optimally pruned and
maximally clustered mapping. Without accuracy loss, TraNNsformer reduces the
area (energy) consumption by 28% - 55% (49% - 67%) with respect to the original
network. Compared to network pruning, TraNNsformer achieves 28% - 49% (15% -
29%) area (energy) savings. Furthermore, TraNNsformer is a technology-aware
framework that allows mapping a given DNN to any MCA size permissible by the
memristive technology for reliable operations.
"
946,Information Storage and Retrieval using Macromolecules as Storage Media,"  To store information at extremely high-density and data-rate, we propose to
adapt, integrate, and extend the techniques developed by chemists and molecular
biologists for the purpose of manipulating biological and other macromolecules.
In principle, volumetric densities in excess of 10^21 bits/cm^3 can be achieved
when individual molecules having dimensions below a nanometer or so are used to
encode the 0's and 1's of a binary string of data. In practice, however, given
the limitations of electron-beam lithography, thin film deposition and
patterning technologies, molecular manipulation in submicron dimensions, etc.,
we believe that volumetric storage densities on the order of 10^16 bits/cm^3
(i.e., petabytes per cubic centimeter) should be readily attainable, leaving
plenty of room for future growth. The unique feature of the proposed new
approach is its focus on the feasibility of storing bits of information in
individual molecules, each only a few angstroms in size.
"
947,Biocompatible Writing of Data into DNA,"  A simple DNA-based data storage scheme is demonstrated in which information
is written using ""addressing"" oligonucleotides. In contrast to other methods
that allow arbitrary code to be stored, the resulting DNA is suitable for
downstream enzymatic and biological processing. This capability is crucial for
DNA computers, and may allow for a diverse array of computational operations to
be carried out using this DNA. Although here we use gel-based methods for
information readout, we also propose more advanced methods involving
protein/DNA complexes and atomic force microscopy/nano-pore schemes for data
readout.
"
948,"Relativized Separation of Reversible and Irreversible Space-Time
  Complexity Classes","  Reversible computing can reduce the energy dissipation of computation, which
can improve cost-efficiency in some contexts. But the practical applicability
of this method depends sensitively on the space and time overhead required by
reversible algorithms. Time and space complexity classes for reversible
machines match conventional ones, but we conjecture that the joint space-time
complexity classes are different, and that a particular reduction by Bennett
minimizes the space-time product complexity of general reversible computations.
We provide an oracle-relativized proof of the separation, and of a lower bound
on space for linear-time reversible simulations. A non-oracle proof applies
when a read-only input is omitted from the space accounting. Both constructions
model one-way function iteration, conjectured to be a problem for which
Bennett's algorithm is optimal.
"
949,"A space-time tradeoff for implementing a function with master equation
  dynamics","  Master equations are commonly used to model the dynamics of physical systems,
including systems that implement single-valued functions like a computer's
update step. However, many such functions cannot be implemented by any master
equation, even approximately, which raises the question of how they can occur
in the real world. Here we show how any function over some ""visible"" states can
be implemented with master equation dynamics--if the dynamics exploits
additional, ""hidden"" states at intermediate times. We also show that any master
equation implementing a function can be decomposed into a sequence of ""hidden""
timesteps, demarcated by changes in what state-to-state transitions have
nonzero probability. In many real-world situations there is a cost both for
more hidden states and for more hidden timesteps. Accordingly, we derive a
""space-time"" tradeoff between the number of hidden states and the number of
hidden timesteps needed to implement any given function.
"
950,Instantons in self-organizing logic gates,"  Self-organizing logic is a recently-suggested framework that allows the
solution of Boolean truth tables ""in reverse,"" i.e., it is able to satisfy the
logical proposition of gates regardless to which terminal(s) the truth value is
assigned (""terminal-agnostic logic""). It can be realized if time non-locality
(memory) is present. A practical realization of self-organizing logic gates
(SOLGs) can be done by combining circuit elements with and without memory. By
employing one such realization, we show, numerically, that SOLGs exploit
elementary instantons to reach equilibrium points. Instantons are classical
trajectories of the non-linear equations of motion describing SOLGs, and
connect topologically distinct critical points in the phase space. By linear
analysis at those points, we show that these instantons connect the initial
critical point of the dynamics, with at least one unstable direction, directly
to the final fixed point. We also show that the memory content of these gates
only affects the relaxation time to reach the logically consistent solution.
Finally, we demonstrate, by solving the corresponding stochastic differential
equations, that since instantons connect critical points, noise and
perturbations may change the instanton trajectory in the phase space, but not
the initial and final critical points. Therefore, even for extremely large
noise levels, the gates self-organize to the correct solution. Our work
provides a physical understanding of, and can serve as an inspiration for, new
models of bi-directional logic gates that are emerging as important tools in
physics-inspired, unconventional computing.
"
951,Towards On-Chip Optical FFTs for Convolutional Neural Networks,"  Convolutional neural networks have become an essential element of spatial
deep learning systems. In the prevailing architecture, the convolution
operation is performed with Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT) electronically in
GPUs. The parallelism of GPUs provides an efficiency over CPUs, however both
approaches being electronic are bound by the speed and power limits of the
interconnect delay inside the circuits. Here we present a silicon photonics
based architecture for convolutional neural networks that harnesses the phase
property of light to perform FFTs efficiently. Our all-optical FFT is based on
nested Mach-Zender Interferometers, directional couplers, and phase shifters,
with backend electro-optic modulators for sampling. The FFT delay depends only
on the propagation delay of the optical signal through the silicon photonics
structures. Designing and analyzing the performance of a convolutional neural
network deployed with our on-chip optical FFT, we find dramatic improvements by
up to 10^4 when compared to state-of-the-art GPUs when exploring a compounded
figure-of-merit given by power per convolution over area. At a high level, this
performance is enabled by mapping the desired mathematical function, an FFT,
synergistically onto hardware, in this case optical delay interferometers.
"
952,"Opportunities and challenges for quantum-assisted machine learning in
  near-term quantum computers","  With quantum computing technologies nearing the era of commercialization and
quantum supremacy, machine learning (ML) appears as one of the promising
""killer"" applications. Despite significant effort, there has been a disconnect
between most quantum ML proposals, the needs of ML practitioners, and the
capabilities of near-term quantum devices to demonstrate quantum enhancement in
the near future. In this contribution to the focus collection on ""What would
you do with 1000 qubits?"", we provide concrete examples of intractable ML tasks
that could be enhanced with near-term devices. We argue that to reach this
target, the focus should be on areas where ML researchers are struggling, such
as generative models in unsupervised and semi-supervised learning, instead of
the popular and more tractable supervised learning techniques. We also
highlight the case of classical datasets with potential quantum-like
statistical correlations where quantum models could be more suitable. We focus
on hybrid quantum-classical approaches and illustrate some of the key
challenges we foresee for near-term implementations. Finally, we introduce the
quantum-assisted Helmholtz machine (QAHM), an attempt to use near-term quantum
devices to tackle high-dimensional datasets of continuous variables. Instead of
using quantum computers to assist deep learning, as previous approaches do, the
QAHM uses deep learning to extract a low-dimensional binary representation of
data, suitable for relatively small quantum processors which can assist the
training of an unsupervised generative model. Although we illustrate this
concept on a quantum annealer, other quantum platforms could benefit as well
from this hybrid quantum-classical framework.
"
953,"Quantum-assisted Helmholtz machines: A quantum-classical deep learning
  framework for industrial datasets in near-term devices","  Machine learning has been presented as one of the key applications for
near-term quantum technologies, given its high commercial value and wide range
of applicability. In this work, we introduce the \textit{quantum-assisted
Helmholtz machine:} a hybrid quantum-classical framework with the potential of
tackling high-dimensional real-world machine learning datasets on continuous
variables. Instead of using quantum computers only to assist deep learning, as
previous approaches have suggested, we use deep learning to extract a
low-dimensional binary representation of data, suitable for processing on
relatively small quantum computers. Then, the quantum hardware and deep
learning architecture work together to train an unsupervised generative model.
We demonstrate this concept using 1644 quantum bits of a D-Wave 2000Q quantum
device to model a sub-sampled version of the MNIST handwritten digit dataset
with 16x16 continuous valued pixels. Although we illustrate this concept on a
quantum annealer, adaptations to other quantum platforms, such as ion-trap
technologies or superconducting gate-model architectures, could be explored
within this flexible framework.
"
954,Programmable DNA-mediated decision maker,"  DNA-mediated computing is a novel technology that seeks to capitalize on the
enormous informational capacity of DNA and has tremendous computational ability
to compete with the current silicon-mediated computing, due to massive
parallelism and unique characteristics inherent in DNA interaction. In this
paper, the methodology of DNA-mediated computing is utilized to enrich decision
theory, by demonstrating how a novel programmable DNA-mediated normative
decision-making apparatus is able to capture rational choice under uncertainty.
"
955,"Evaluative Assessment of an X-band Microstrip Patch Antenna for Wireless
  Systems","  Microstrip patch antennas (MPAs) are rapidly gaining more attention due to
the proliferation of communication devices and systems with frequencies
becoming more suitable for the size and performance of this type of antenna.
Due to recent advancements in semiconductor technology, high dielectric
constant materials are used to achieve additional size reduction which has made
MPAs very useful and popular in the design of mobile devices and wireless
systems. However, MPAs suffer from problems associated with narrow bandwidth
and low gain. Techniques employed for improving the performance of MPA hinge on
tweaking features such as the patch size, substrate height, ground plane size
and feeding method. In view of this, this research designs and analyzes the
performance of an X-band MPA for wireless systems using CST Microwave Studio.
Including the ground plane, the proposed design has a low profile structure of
17 mm x 17 mm x 1.6 mm which is suitable for wireless systems. The proposed
design also resonates at a frequency of 10 GHz with an omnidirectional
radiation pattern exhibiting a gain of 7.2 dBi. Return Loss, VSWR, Gain and
Radiation Pattern are the performance indicators employed in this research. The
proposed MPA design demonstrates marked performance improvement when
benchmarked with a similar MPA designed for 5G applications.
"
956,Enhancing TCP End-to-End Performance in Millimeter-Wave Communications,"  Recently, millimeter-wave (mmWave) communications have received great
attention due to the availability of large spectrum resources. Nevertheless,
their impact on TCP performance has been overlooked, which is observed that the
said TCP performance collapse occurs owing to the significant difference in
signal quality between LOS and NLOS links. We propose a novel TCP design for
mmWave communications, a mmWave performance enhancing proxy (mmPEP), enabling
not only to overcome TCP performance collapse but also exploit the properties
of mmWave channels. The base station installs the TCP proxy to operate the two
functionalities called Ack management and batch retransmission. Specifically,
the proxy sends the said early-Ack to the server not to decrease its sending
rate even in the NLOS status. In addition, when a packet-loss is detected, the
proxy retransmits not only lost packets but also the certain number of the
following packets expected to be lost too. It is verified by ns-3 simulation
that compared with benchmark, mmPEP enhances the end-to-end rate and packet
delivery ratio by maintaining high sending rate with decreasing the loss
recovery time.
"
957,"Number of hidden states needed to physically implement a given
  conditional distribution","  We consider the problem of how to construct a physical process over a finite
state space $X$ that applies some desired conditional distribution $P$ to
initial states to produce final states. This problem arises often in the
thermodynamics of computation and nonequilibrium statistical physics more
generally (e.g., when designing processes to implement some desired
computation, feedback controller, or Maxwell demon). It was previously known
that some conditional distributions cannot be implemented using any master
equation that involves just the states in $X$. However, here we show that any
conditional distribution $P$ can in fact be implemented---if additional
""hidden"" states not in $X$ are available. Moreover, we show that it is always
possible to implement $P$ in a thermodynamically reversible manner. We then
investigate a novel cost of the physical resources needed to implement a given
distribution $P$: the minimal number of hidden states needed to do so. We
calculate this cost exactly for the special case where $P$ represents a
single-valued function, and provide an upper bound for the general case, in
terms of the nonnegative rank of $P$. These results show that having access to
one extra binary degree of freedom, thus doubling the total number of states,
is sufficient to implement any $P$ with a master equation in a
thermodynamically reversible way, if there are no constraints on the allowed
form of the master equation. (Such constraints can greatly increase the minimal
needed number of hidden states.) Our results also imply that for certain $P$
that can be implemented without hidden states, having hidden states permits an
implementation that generates less heat.

959,Cost Modeling and Projection for Stacked Nanowire Fabric,"  To continue scaling beyond 2-D CMOS with 3-D integration, any new 3-D IC
technology has to be comparable or better than 2-D CMOS in terms of
scalability, enhanced functionality, density, power, performance, cost, and
reliability. Transistor-level 3-D integration carries the most potential in
this regard. Recently, we proposed a stacked horizontal nanowire based
transistor-level 3-D integration approach, called SN3D [1][2] that solves
scaling challenges and achieves tremendous benefits with respect to 2-D CMOS
while keeping manageable thermal profile. In this paper, we present the cost
analysis of SN3D and show comparison with 2-D CMOS (2D), conventional TSV based
3-D (T3D) and Monolithic 3-D integrations (M3D). In our cost model, we capture
the implications of manufacturing, circuit density, interconnects, bonding and
heat in determining die cost, and evaluate how cost scales as transistor count
increases. Since SN3D is a new 3-D IC fabric, based on our proposed
manufacturing pathway[1] we assumed complexity of fabrication steps as
proportionality constants in our cost estimation model. Our analysis revealed
86%, 72% and 74% reduction in area; 55%, 43% and 43% reduction in interconnects
distribution and total interconnect length for SN3D, which largely contributed
to 70%, 67% and 68% reduction in cost in comparison to 2D, T3D and M3D
respectively.

960,A Neural Network Based on Synchronized Pairs of Nano-Oscillators,"  Artificial neural networks are intensively used to perform cognitive tasks
such as image classification on traditional computers. With the end of CMOS
scaling and increasing demand for efficient neural networks, alternative
architectures implementing neural functions efficiently are being studied. This
study leverages the demonstrated frequency tuning capabilities of compact
nano-oscillators and their synchronization dynamics to implement a neuron using
a pair of synchronized oscillators, and which features an unconventional
response curve. We show that this compact neuron can naturally implement
generic logic gates, including XOR. A simulated oscillator-based neural network
is then shown to achieve results equivalent to standard approaches on two
reference classification tasks. Finally, the performance of the system is
evaluated in the presence of oscillator phase noise, an important issue of
oscillating nanodevices. These results open the way for the design of
alternative architectures adapted to efficient neural network execution.
"
961,"An On-chip Trainable and Clock-less Spiking Neural Network with 1R
  Memristive Synapses","  Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are being explored in an attempt to mimic
brain's capability to learn and recognize at low power. Crossbar architecture
with highly scalable Resistive RAM or RRAM array serving as synaptic weights
and neuronal drivers in the periphery is an attractive option for SNN.
Recognition (akin to reading the synaptic weight) requires small amplitude bias
applied across the RRAM to minimize conductance change. Learning (akin to
writing or updating the synaptic weight) requires large amplitude bias pulses
to produce a conductance change. The contradictory bias amplitude requirement
to perform reading and writing simultaneously and asynchronously, akin to
biology, is a major challenge. Solutions suggested in the literature rely on
time-division-multiplexing of read and write operations based on clocks, or
approximations ignoring the reading when coincidental with writing. In this
work, we overcome this challenge and present a clock-less approach wherein
reading and writing are performed in different frequency domains. This enables
learning and recognition simultaneously on an SNN. We validate our scheme in
SPICE circuit simulator by translating a two-layered feed-forward Iris
classifying SNN to demonstrate software-equivalent performance. The system
performance is not adversely affected by a voltage dependence of conductance in
realistic RRAMs, despite departing from linearity. Overall, our approach
enables direct implementation of biological SNN algorithms in hardware.
"
962,Insertion Sort with Self-reproducing Comparator P System,"  We present in this paper a self-reproducing comparator P~system that
simulates insertion sort. The comparator $\Pi_c$ is a degree-2 membrane and
structured as $\mu = [_{h_0} [_{h_1}]_{h_1} [_{h_2}]_{h_2} ]_{h_0}$. A
maximizing $\Pi_c$ compares two multisets $a$ and $b$ where $\min(|a|,|b|)$ is
stored in compartment $h_1$ while $\max(|a|,|b|)$ is stored in compartment
$h_2$. A conditional reproduction rule triggers $\Pi_c$ to clone itself out via
compartment division followed by endocytosis of the cloned compartment. We
present the process of sorting as a collection of transactions implemented in
hierarchical levels where each level has different concurrent or serialized
steps.

963,"A Straightforward Method to Judge the Completeness of a Polymorphic Gate
  Set","  Polymorphic circuits are a special kind of circuits which possess some
different build-in functions and these functions are activated by environment
parameters, like light and VDD. Some theories have been proposed to guide the
design of polymorphic circuits, including the definition of complete
polymorphic gate sets and algorithms to judge the completeness of a polymorphic
gate set.
  However, the previous algorithms have to enumerate all the polymorphic
signals for judging the completeness of a polymorphic gate set, and it is not
easy to be conducted manually. In this paper, a straightforward method is
proposed to judge the completeness of a polymorphic gate set. And the
correctness of the straightforward method is proved theoretically. Some
examples are given to show that the proposed method could be conducted step by
step. Its actual computing cost is usually low, and it is suitable for manual
operation.

964,A Simplification Method of Polymorphic Boolean Functions,"  Polymorphic circuits are a special kind of circuits which possess multiple

this brief presents a simplification method of the polymorphic Boolean
function.
"
965,"Design Methods for Polymorphic Combinational Logic Circuits based on the
  Bi_Decomposition Approach","  Polymorphic circuits are a special kind of digital logic components, which
possess multiple build-in functions. In different environments, a polymorphic
circuit would perform different functions. Evolutionary Algorithms, Binary
Decision Diagrams (BDD) and the multiplex method have been adopted to design
polymorphic circuits. However, the evolutionary methods face the scalable
problem. The BDD method consumes too much gate resource. The polymorphic
circuit built by the multiplex method rarely contains polymorphic gates. In
this paper, based on the traditional Bi_Decomposition circuit design approach,
two methods, i.e. the Poly_Bi_Decomposition method and the
Transformation&Bi_Decomposition method, are proposed for designing polymorphic
circuits. The Poly_Bi_Decomposition method can design relatively large and
gate-efficient polymorphic circuits with a higher percentage of polymorphic
gates. The Transformation&Bi_Decomposition method can use the traditional
circuit design approaches and tools, e.g. Bi_Decomposition, to design
polymorphic circuits directly. The experimental results show the good
performance of the proposed methods.

feasibility of this concept, we report preliminary results of DNA readout
experiments conducted in miniaturized chambers that are scalable to even
smaller dimensions. We show that translocation of a single-stranded DNA
molecule (consisting of 50 adenosine bases followed by 100 cytosine bases)
through an ion-channel yields a characteristic signal that is attributable to
the 2-segment structure of the molecule. We also examine the dependence of the
translocation rate and speed on the adjustable parameters of the experiment.

968,Multi-level Memristive Memory with Resistive Networks,"  Analog memory is of great importance in neurocomputing technologies field,
but still remains difficult to implement. With emergence of memristors in VLSI
technologies the idea of designing scalable analog data storage elements finds
its second wind. A memristor, known for its history dependent resistance
levels, independently can provide blocks of binary or discrete state data
storage. However, using single memristor to save the analog value is
practically limited due to the device variability and implementation
complexity. In this paper, we present a new design of discrete state memory
cell consisting of subcells constructed from a memristor and its resistive
network. A memristor in the sub-cells provides the storage element, while its
resistive network is used for programming its resistance. Several sub-cells are
then connected in parallel, resembling potential divider configuration. The
output of the memory cell is the voltage resulting from distributing the input
voltage among the sub-cells. Here, proposed design was programmed to obtain 10
and 27 different output levels depending on the configuration of the combined
resistive networks within the sub-cell. Despite the simplicity of the circuit,
this realization of multilevel memory provides increased number of output
levels compared to previous designs of memory technologies based on memristors.
Simulation results of proposed memory are analyzed providing explicit data on
the issues of distinguishing discrete analog output levels and sensitivity of
the cell to oscillations in write signal patterns.

969,"A geographically distributed bio-hybrid neural network with memristive
  plasticity","  Throughout evolution the brain has mastered the art of processing real-world
inputs through networks of interlinked spiking neurons. Synapses have emerged
as key elements that, owing to their plasticity, are merging neuron-to-neuron
signalling with memory storage and computation. Electronics has made important
steps in emulating neurons through neuromorphic circuits and synapses with
nanoscale memristors, yet novel applications that interlink them in
heterogeneous bio-inspired and bio-hybrid architectures are just beginning to
materialise. The use of memristive technologies in brain-inspired architectures
for computing or for sensing spiking activity of biological neurons8 are only
recent examples, however interlinking brain and electronic neurons through
plasticity-driven synaptic elements has remained so far in the realm of the
imagination. Here, we demonstrate a bio-hybrid neural network (bNN) where
memristors work as ""synaptors"" between rat neural circuits and VLSI neurons.
The two fundamental synaptors, from artificial-to-biological (ABsyn) and from
biological-to- artificial (BAsyn), are interconnected over the Internet. The
bNN extends across Europe, collapsing spatial boundaries existing in natural
brain networks and laying the foundations of a new geographically distributed

"
970,Charge-based computing with analogue reconfigurable gates,"  As the world enters the age of ubiquitous computing, the need for
reconfigurable hardware operating close to the fundamental limits of energy
consumption becomes increasingly pressing. Simultaneously, scaling-driven
performance improvements within the framework of traditional analogue and
digital design become progressively more restricted by fundamental physical
constraints. Thus, a true paradigm shift in electronics design is required for
fuelling the next big burst in technology. Here we lay the foundations of a new
design paradigm that fuses analogue and digital thinking by combining digital
electronics with memristive devices for achieving charge-based computation;
information processing where every dissipated charge counts. This is realised
by introducing memristive devices into standard logic gates, thus rendering
them reconfigurable and able to perform analogue computation at a power cost
close to digital. The power of this concept is then showcased by experimentally
demonstrating a hardware data clusterer and a fuzzy NAND gate using this
principle.

971,"Flora robotica -- An Architectural System Combining Living Natural
  Plants and Distributed Robots","  Key to our project flora robotica is the idea of creating a bio-hybrid system
of tightly coupled natural plants and distributed robots to grow architectural
artifacts and spaces. Our motivation with this ground research project is to
lay a principled foundation towards the design and implementation of living
architectural systems that provide functionalities beyond those of orthodox
building practice, such as self-repair, material accumulation and
self-organization. Plants and robots work together to create a living organism
that is inhabited by human beings. User-defined design objectives help to steer
the directional growth of the plants, but also the system's interactions with
its inhabitants determine locations where growth is prohibited or desired
(e.g., partitions, windows, occupiable space). We report our plant species
selection process and aspects of living architecture. A leitmotif of our
project is the rich concept of braiding: braids are produced by robots from
continuous material and serve as both scaffolds and initial architectural
artifacts before plants take over and grow the desired architecture. We use
light and hormones as attraction stimuli and far-red light as repelling
stimulus to influence the plants. Applied sensors range from simple proximity
sensing to detect the presence of plants to sophisticated sensing technology,
such as electrophysiology and measurements of sap flow. We conclude by
discussing our anticipated final demonstrator that integrates key features of
flora robotica, such as the continuous growth process of architectural
artifacts and self-repair of living architecture.

972,"Is Smaller Better: A Proposal To Consider Bacteria For Biologically
  Inspired Modeling","  Bacteria are easily characterizable model organisms with an impressively
complicated set of capabilities. Among their capabilities is quorum sensing, a
detailed cell-cell signaling system that may have a common origin with
eukaryotic cell-cell signaling. Not only are the two phenomena similar, but
quorum sensing, as is the case with any bacterial phenomenon when compared to
eukaryotes, is also easier to study in depth than eukaryotic cell-cell
signaling. This ease of study is a contrast to the only partially understood
cellular dynamics of neurons. Here we review the literature on the strikingly
neuron-like qualities of bacterial colonies and biofilms, including ion-based
and hormonal signaling, and action potential-like behavior. This allows them to
feasibly act as an analog for neurons that could produce more detailed and more
accurate biologically-based computational models. Using bacteria as the basis
for biologically feasible computational models may allow models to better
harness the tremendous ability of biological organisms to make decisions and
process information. Additionally, principles gleaned from bacterial function
have the potential to influence computational efforts divorced from biology,
just as neuronal function has in the abstract influenced countless machine
learning efforts.
"
973,Quantum error correction for non-maximally entangled states,"  Quantum states have high affinity for errors and hence error correction is of
utmost importance to realise a quantum computer. Laflamme showed that 5 qubits
are necessary to correct a single error on a qubit. In a Pauli error model,
four different types of errors can occur on a qubit. Maximally entangled states
are orthogonal to each other and hence can be uniquely distinguished by a
measurement in the Bell basis. Thus a measurement in Bell basis and a unitary
transformation is sufficient to correct error in Bell states. However, such a
measurement is not possible for non-maximally entangled states. In this work we
show that the 16 possible errors for a non-maximally entangled two qubit system
map to only 8 distinct error states. Hence, it is possible to correct the error
without perfect knowledge of the type of error. Furthermore, we show that the
possible errors can be grouped in such a way that all 4 errors can occur on one
qubit, whereas only bit flip error can occur on the second qubit. As a
consequence, instead of 10, only 8 qubits are sufficient to correct a single
error. We propose an 8-qubit error correcting code to correct a single error in
a non-maximally entangled state. We further argue that for an $n$-qubit
non-maximally entangled state of the form $a|0>^{n} + b|1>^{n}$, it is always
possible to correct a single error with fewer than $5n$ qubits, in fact only
$3n+2$ qubits suffice.
"
974,"Power Optimizations in MTJ-based Neural Networks through Stochastic
  Computing","  Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have found widespread applications in tasks
such as pattern recognition and image classification. However, hardware
implementations of ANNs using conventional binary arithmetic units are
computationally expensive, energy-intensive and have large area overheads.
Stochastic Computing (SC) is an emerging paradigm which replaces these
conventional units with simple logic circuits and is particularly suitable for
fault-tolerant applications. Spintronic devices, such as Magnetic Tunnel
Junctions (MTJs), are capable of replacing CMOS in memory and logic circuits.
In this work, we propose an energy-efficient use of MTJs, which exhibit
probabilistic switching behavior, as Stochastic Number Generators (SNGs), which
forms the basis of our NN implementation in the SC domain. Further, error
resilient target applications of NNs allow us to introduce Approximate
Computing, a framework wherein accuracy of computations is traded-off for
substantial reductions in power consumption. We propose approximating the
synaptic weights in our MTJ-based NN implementation, in ways brought about by
properties of our MTJ-SNG, to achieve energy-efficiency. We design an algorithm
that can perform such approximations within a given error tolerance in a
single-layer NN in an optimal way owing to the convexity of the problem
formulation. We then use this algorithm and develop a heuristic approach for
approximating multi-layer NNs. To give a perspective of the effectiveness of
our approach, a 43% reduction in power consumption was obtained with less than
1% accuracy loss on a standard classification problem, with 26% being brought
about by the proposed algorithm.
"
975,"A differential memristive synapse circuit for on-line learning in
  neuromorphic computing systems","  Spike-based learning with memristive devices in neuromorphic computing
architectures typically uses learning circuits that require overlapping pulses
from pre- and post-synaptic nodes. This imposes severe constraints on the
length of the pulses transmitted in the network, and on the network's
throughput. Furthermore, most of these circuits do not decouple the currents
flowing through memristive devices from the one stimulating the target neuron.
This can be a problem when using devices with high conductance values, because
of the resulting large currents. In this paper we propose a novel circuit that
decouples the current produced by the memristive device from the one used to
stimulate the post-synaptic neuron, by using a novel differential scheme based
on the Gilbert normalizer circuit. We show how this circuit is useful for
reducing the effect of variability in the memristive devices, and how it is
ideally suited for spike-based learning mechanisms that do not require
overlapping pre- and post-synaptic pulses. We demonstrate the features of the
proposed synapse circuit with SPICE simulations, and validate its learning
properties with high-level behavioral network simulations which use a
stochastic gradient descent learning rule in two classification tasks.

976,"MOL-Eye: A New Metric for the Performance Evaluation of a Molecular
  Signal","  Inspired by the eye diagram in classical radio frequency (RF) based
communications, the MOL-Eye diagram is proposed for the performance evaluation
of a molecular signal within the context of molecular communication. Utilizing
various features of this diagram, three new metrics for the performance
evaluation of a molecular signal, namely the maximum eye height, standard
deviation of received molecules, and counting SNR (CSNR) are introduced. The
applicability of these performance metrics in this domain is verified by
comparing the performance of binary concentration shift keying (BCSK) and BCSK
with consecutive power adjustment (BCSK-CPA) modulation techniques in a
vessel-like environment with laminar flow. The results show that, in addition
to classical performance metrics such as bit-error rate and channel capacity,
these performance metrics can also be used to show the advantage of an
efficient modulation technique over a simpler one.
"
977,"An Ultralow Leakage Synaptic Scaling Homeostatic Plasticity Circuit With
  Configurable Time Scales up to 100 ks","  Homeostatic plasticity is a stabilizing mechanism commonly observed in real
neural systems that allows neurons to maintain their activity around a
functional operating point. This phenomenon can be used in neuromorphic systems
to compensate for slowly changing conditions or chronic shifts in the system
configuration. However, to avoid interference with other adaptation or learning
processes active in the neuromorphic system, it is important that the
homeostatic plasticity mechanism operates on time scales that are much longer
than conventional synaptic plasticity ones. In this paper we present an
ultra-low leakage circuit, integrated into an automatic gain control scheme,
that can implement the synaptic scaling homeostatic process over extremely long
time scales. Synaptic scaling consists in globally scaling the synaptic weights
of all synapses impinging onto a neuron maintaining their relative differences,
to preserve the effects of learning. The scheme we propose controls the global
gain of analog log-domain synapse circuits to keep the neuron's average firing
rate constant around a set operating point, over extremely long time scales. To
validate the proposed scheme, we implemented the ultra-low leakage synaptic
scaling homeostatic plasticity circuit in a standard 0.18 $\mu$m Complementary
Metal-Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) process, and integrated it in an array of
dynamic synapses connected to an adaptive integrate and fire neuron. The
circuit occupies a silicon area of 84 $\mu$m x 22 $\mu$m and consumes
approximately 10.8 nW with a 1.8 V supply voltage. We present experimental
results from the homeostatic circuit and demonstrate how it can be configured
to exhibit time scales of up to 100 kilo-seconds, thanks to a controllable
leakage current that can be scaled down to 0.45 atto-Amperes (2.8 electrons/s).

analog multipliers. Compared to digital multipliers, CTT-based analog
multiplier shows significant area and power reduction. The proposed computing
engine is composed of a scalable CTT multiplier array and energy efficient
analog-digital interfaces. Through implementing the sequential analog fabric
(SAF), the engine mixed-signal interfaces are simplified and hardware overhead
remains constant regardless of the size of the array. A proof-of-concept 784 by
784 CTT computing engine is implemented using TSMC 28nm CMOS technology and
occupied 0.68mm2. The simulated performance achieves 76.8 TOPS (8-bit) with 500
MHz clock frequency and consumes 14.8 mW. As an example, we utilize this
computing engine to address a classic pattern recognition problem --
classifying handwritten digits on MNIST database and obtained a performance
comparable to state-of-the-art fully connected neural networks using 8-bit
fixed-point resolution.
"
980,"Stochastic Channel Modeling for Diffusive Mobile Molecular Communication
  Systems","  In this paper, we develop a mathematical framework for modeling the
time-variant stochastic channels of diffusive mobile MC systems. In particular,
we consider a diffusive mobile MC system consisting of a pair of transmitter
and receiver nano-machines suspended in a fluid medium with a uniform bulk
flow, where we assume that either the transmitter, or the receiver, or both are
mobile and we model the mobility by Brownian motion. The transmitter and
receiver nano-machines exchange information via diffusive signaling molecules.
Due to the random movements of the transmitter and receiver nano-machines, the
statistics of the channel impulse response (CIR) change over time. We derive
closed-form expressions for the mean, the autocorrelation function (ACF), the
cumulative distribution function (CDF), and the probability density function
(PDF) of the time-variant CIR. Exploiting the ACF, we define the coherence time
of the time-variant MC channel as a metric for characterization of the
variations of the CIR. The derived CDF is employed for calculation of the
outage probability of the system. We also show that under certain conditions,
the PDF of the CIR can be accurately approximated by a Log-normal distribution.
Based on this approximation, we derive a simple model for outdated channel
state information (CSI). Moreover, we derive an analytical expression for
evaluation of the expected error probability of a simple detector for the
considered MC system. In order to investigate the impact of CIR decorrelation
over time, we compare the performances of a detector with perfect CSI knowledge
and a detector with outdated CSI knowledge. The accuracy of the proposed
analytical expressions is verified via particle-based simulation of the
Brownian motion.
"
981,Generic Wave Digital Emulation of Memristive Devices,"  Neuromorphic circuits mimic partial functionalities of brain in a
bio-inspired information processing sense in order to achieve similar
efficiencies as biological systems. While there are common mathematical models
for neurons, which can be realized as nonlinear oscillating circuits, an
electrical representation of the synaptic coupling between those is more
challenging. Since this coupling strength depends on the learning procedure in
the past, it should include a kind of memory. We believe that memristive
devices, which are essentially nonlinear resistors with memory, are potential
candidates for replacing synapses in neuromorphic circuits. Due to a huge
number of synapses in a complex neuromorphic circuit, pre-investigations based
on simulations of such systems can be very inefficient and time-consuming.
Flexible and real-time capable memristive emulators, which can directly be
incorporated into real circuits, can overcome this problem. In our approach, we
introduce a generic memristive emulator based on wave digital principles. The
proposed emulator is flexible, robust, efficient, and it preserves the
passivity of the real device. This, in turn, also makes it reusable independent
of a particular application. In the presented work, the emulation of different
mathematical models as well as of a real device based on physical models are
listed.
"
982,Optical computing by injection-locked lasers,"  A programmable optical computer has remained an elusive concept. To construct
a practical computing primitive equivalent to an electronic Boolean logic, one
should find a nonlinear phenomenon that overcomes weaknesses present in many
optical processing schemes. Ideally, the nonlinearity should provide a
functionally complete set of logic operations, enable ultrafast all-optical
programmability, and allow cascaded operations without a change in the
operating wavelength or in the signal encoding format. Here we demonstrate a
programmable logic gate using an injection-locked Vertical-Cavity
Surface-Emitting Laser (VCSEL). The gate program is switched between the AND
and the OR operations at the rate of 1 GHz with Bit Error Ratio (BER) of 10e-6
without changes in the wavelength or in the signal encoding format. The scheme
is based on nonlinearity of normalization operations, which can be used to
construct any continuous complex function or operation, Boolean or otherwise.
"
983,Thermodynamic Binding Networks,"  Strand displacement and tile assembly systems are designed to follow
prescribed kinetic rules (i.e., exhibit a specific time-evolution). However,
the expected behavior in the limit of infinite time--known as thermodynamic
equilibrium--is often incompatible with the desired computation. Basic physical
chemistry implicates this inconsistency as a source of unavoidable error. Can
the thermodynamic equilibrium be made consistent with the desired computational
pathway? In order to formally study this question, we introduce a new model of
molecular computing in which computation is driven by the thermodynamic driving
forces of enthalpy and entropy. To ensure greatest generality we do not assume
that there are any constraints imposed by geometry and treat monomers as
unstructured collections of binding sites. In this model we design Boolean
AND/OR formulas, as well as a self-assembling binary counter, where the
thermodynamically favored states are exactly the desired final output
configurations. Though inspired by DNA nanotechnology, the model is
sufficiently general to apply to a wide variety of chemical systems.
"
984,Oscillator-based Ising Machine,"  Many combinatorial optimization problems can be mapped to finding the ground
states of the corresponding Ising Hamiltonians. The physical systems that can
solve optimization problems in this way, namely Ising machines, have been
attracting more and more attention recently. Our work shows that Ising machines
can be realized using almost any nonlinear self-sustaining oscillators with
logic values encoded in their phases. Many types of such oscillators are
readily available for large-scale integration, with potentials in high-speed
and low-power operation. In this paper, we describe the operation and mechanism
of oscillator-based Ising machines. The feasibility of our scheme is
demonstrated through several examples in simulation and hardware, among which a
simulation study reports average solutions exceeding those from state-of-art
Ising machines on a benchmark combinatorial optimization problem of size 2000.

985,"On-chip Face Recognition System Design with Memristive Hierarchical
  Temporal Memory","  Hierarchical Temporal Memory is a new machine learning algorithm intended to
mimic the working principle of neocortex, part of the human brain, which is
responsible for learning, classification, and making predictions. Although many
works illustrate its effectiveness as a software algorithm, hardware design for
HTM remains an open research problem. Hence, this work proposes an architecture
for HTM Spatial Pooler and Temporal Memory with learning mechanism, which
creates a single image for each class based on important and unimportant
features of all images in the training set. In turn, the reduction in the
number of templates within database reduces the memory requirements and
increases the processing speed. Moreover, face recognition analysis indicates
that for a large number of training images, the proposed design provides higher
accuracy results (83.5\%) compared to only Spatial Pooler design presented in
the previous works.
"
986,Memristive System Design for Variable Pixel G-Neighbor Denoising Filter,"  Image blurring artifact is the main challenge to any spatial, denoising
filters. This artifact is contributed by the heterogeneous intensities within
the given neighborhood or window of fixed size. Selection of most similar
intensities (G-Neighbors) helps to adapt the window shape which is of
edge-aware nature and subsequently reduce this blurring artifact. The paper
presents a memristive circuit design to implement this variable pixel
G-Neighbor filter. The memristive circuits exhibits parallel processing
capabilities (near real-time) and neuromorphic architectures. The proposed
design is demonstrated as simulations of both algorithm (MATLAB) and circuit
(SPICE). Circuit design is evaluated for various parameters such as processing
time, fabrication area used, and power consumption. Denoising performance is
demonstrated using image quality metrics such as peak signal-to-noise ratio
(PSNR), mean square error (MSE), and structural similarity index measure
(SSIM). Combining adaptive filtering method with mean filter resulted in
average improvement of MSE to about 65\% reduction, increase of PSNR and SSIM
to nearly 18\% and 12\% correspondingly.
"
987,"Computing properties of stable configurations of thermodynamic binding
  networks","  The promise of chemical computation lies in controlling systems incompatible
with traditional electronic micro-controllers, with applications in synthetic
biology and nano-scale manufacturing. Computation is typically embedded in
kinetics---the specific time evolution of a chemical system. However, if the
desired output is not thermodynamically stable, basic physical chemistry
dictates that thermodynamic forces will drive the system toward error
throughout the computation. The thermodynamic binding network (TBN) model was
introduced to formally study how the thermodynamic equilibrium can be made
consistent with the desired computation, and it idealizes tradeoffs between
configurational entropy and binding. Here we prove the computational hardness
of natural questions about TBNs and develop a practical algorithm for verifying
the correctness of constructions by translating the problem into propositional
logic and solving the resulting formula. The TBN model together with automated
verification tools will help inform strategies for error reduction in molecular
computing, including the extensively studied models of strand displacement
cascades and algorithmic tile assembly.

988,On Memory System Design for Stochastic Computing,"  Growing uncertainty in design parameters (and therefore, in design
functionality) renders stochastic computing particularly promising, which
represents and processes data as quantized probabilities. However, due to the
difference in data representation, integrating conventional memory (designed
and optimized for non-stochastic computing) in stochastic computing systems
inevitably incurs a significant data conversion overhead. Barely any stochastic
computing proposal to-date covers the memory impact. In this paper, as the
first study of its kind to the best of our knowledge, we rethink the memory
system design for stochastic computing. The result is a seamless stochastic
system, StochMem, which features analog memory to trade the energy and area
overhead of data conversion for computation accuracy. In this manner StochMem
can reduce the energy (area) overhead by up-to 52.8% (93.7%) at the cost of at
most 0.7% loss in computation accuracy.

989,"Stochastic Spiking Neural Networks Enabled by Magnetic Tunnel Junctions:
  From Nontelegraphic to Telegraphic Switching Regimes","  Stochastic spiking neural networks based on nanoelectronic spin devices can
be a possible pathway to achieving ""brainlike"" compact and energy-effcient
cognitive intelligence. The computational model attempt to exploit the
intrinsic device stochasticity of nanoelectronic synaptic or neural components
to perform learning or inference. However, there has been limited analysis on
the scaling effect of stochastic spin devices and its impact on the operation
of such stochastic networks at the system level. This work attempts to explore
the design space and analyze the performance of nanomagnet-based stochastic
neuromorphic computing architectures for magnets with different barrier
heights. We illustrate how the underlying network architecture must be modified
to account for the random telegraphic switching behavior displayed by magnets
with low barrier heights as they are scaled into the superparamagnetic regime.
We perform a device-to-system-level analysis on a deep neural-network
architecture for a digit-recognition problem on the MNIST data set.
"
990,Reservoir Computing using Stochastic p-Bits,"  We present a general hardware framework for building networks that directly
implement Reservoir Computing, a popular software method for implementing and
training Recurrent Neural Networks and are particularly suited for temporal
inferencing and pattern recognition. We provide a specific example of a
candidate hardware unit based on a combination of soft-magnets, spin-orbit
materials and CMOS transistors that can implement these networks. Efficient non
von-Neumann hardware implementation of reservoir computers can open up a
pathway for integration of temporal Neural Networks in a wide variety of
emerging systems such as Internet of Things (IoTs), industrial controls, bio-
and photo-sensors, and self-driving automotives.
"
991,"Low-Energy Deep Belief Networks using Intrinsic Sigmoidal
  Spintronic-based Probabilistic Neurons","  A low-energy hardware implementation of deep belief network (DBN)
architecture is developed using near-zero energy barrier probabilistic spin
logic devices (p-bits), which are modeled to realize an intrinsic sigmoidal
activation function. A CMOS/spin based weighted array structure is designed to
implement a restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM). Device-level simulations based
on precise physics relations are used to validate the sigmoidal relation
between the output probability of a p-bit and its input currents.
Characteristics of the resistive networks and p-bits are modeled in SPICE to
perform a circuit-level simulation investigating the performance, area, and
power consumption tradeoffs of the weighted array. In the application-level
simulation, a DBN is implemented in MATLAB for digit recognition using the
extracted device and circuit behavioral models. The MNIST data set is used to
assess the accuracy of the DBN using 5,000 training images for five distinct
network topologies. The results indicate that a baseline error rate of 36.8%
for a 784x10 DBN trained by 100 samples can be reduced to only 3.7% using a
784x800x800x10 DBN trained by 5,000 input samples. Finally, Power dissipation
and accuracy tradeoffs for probabilistic computing mechanisms using resistive
devices are identified.
"
992,Achieving Phase-based Logic Bit Storage in Mechanical Metronomes,"  Recently, oscillator-based Boolean computation has been proposed for its
potentials in noise immunity and energy efficiency. In such a system, logic
bits are encoded in the relative phases of oscillating signals and stored in
injection-locked oscillators. To show that the scheme is very general and not
specific to electronic oscillators, in this paper, we report our work on
storing a phase-based logic bit in the relative phase between two mechanical
metronomes. While the synchronization of metronomes is a classic example
showing the effects of injection locking, our work takes it one step further by
demonstrating the bistable phase in sub-harmonically injection-locked
metronomes --- a key mechanism for oscillator-based Boolean computation.
Although we do not expect to make computers with metronomes, our study
demonstrates the generality of this new computation paradigm and may inspire
its practical implementations in various fields, eg, MEMS, silicon photonics,
spintronics, synthetic biology, etc.
"
993,"On Mitigation of Side-Channel Attacks in 3D ICs: Decorrelating Thermal
  Patterns from Power and Activity","  Various side-channel attacks (SCAs) on ICs have been successfully
demonstrated and also mitigated to some degree. In the context of 3D ICs,
however, prior art has mainly focused on efficient implementations of classical
SCA countermeasures. That is, SCAs tailored for up-and-coming 3D ICs have been
overlooked so far. In this paper, we conduct such a novel study and focus on
one of the most accessible and critical side channels: thermal leakage of
activity and power patterns. We address the thermal leakage in 3D ICs early on
during floorplanning, along with tailored extensions for power and thermal
management. Our key idea is to carefully exploit the specifics of material and
structural properties in 3D ICs, thereby decorrelating the thermal behaviour
from underlying power and activity patterns. Most importantly, we discuss
powerful SCAs and demonstrate how our open-source tool helps to mitigate them.
"
994,"Automated optimization of large quantum circuits with continuous
  parameters","  We develop and implement automated methods for optimizing quantum circuits of
the size and type expected in quantum computations that outperform classical
computers. We show how to handle continuous gate parameters and report a
collection of fast algorithms capable of optimizing large-scale quantum
circuits. For the suite of benchmarks considered, we obtain substantial
reductions in gate counts. In particular, we provide better optimization in
significantly less time than previous approaches, while making minimal
structural changes so as to preserve the basic layout of the underlying quantum
algorithms. Our results help bridge the gap between the computations that can
be run on existing hardware and those that are expected to outperform classical
computers.
"
995,"SPICE Simulation of tunnel FET aiming at 32 kHz crystal-oscillator
  operation","  We numerically investigate the possibility of using Tunnel field-effect
transistor (TFET) in a 32 kHz crystal oscillator circuit to reduce power
consumption. A simulation using SPICE (Simulation Program with Integrated
Circuit Emphasis) is carried out based on a conventional CMOS transistor model.
It is shown that the power consumption of TFET is one-tenth that of
conventional low-power CMOS.
"
996,Collaborative Computation in Self-Organizing Particle Systems,"  Many forms of programmable matter have been proposed for various tasks. We
use an abstract model of self-organizing particle systems for programmable
matter which could be used for a variety of applications, including smart paint
and coating materials for engineering or programmable cells for medical uses.
Previous research using this model has focused on shape formation and other
spatial configuration problems (e.g., coating and compression). In this work we
study foundational computational tasks that exceed the capabilities of the
individual constant size memory of a particle, such as implementing a counter
and matrix-vector multiplication. These tasks represent new ways to use these
self-organizing systems, which, in conjunction with previous shape and
configuration work, make the systems useful for a wider variety of tasks. They
can also leverage the distributed and dynamic nature of the self-organizing
system to be more efficient and adaptable than on traditional linear computing
hardware. Finally, we demonstrate applications of similar types of computations
with self-organizing systems to image processing, with implementations of image
color transformation and edge detection algorithms.

997,"A Multi-Bit Neuromorphic Weight Cell using Ferroelectric FETs, suitable
  for SoC Integration","  A multi-bit digital weight cell for high-performance, inference-only
non-GPU-like neuromorphic accelerators is presented. The cell is designed with
simplicity of peripheral circuitry in mind. Non-volatile storage of weights
which eliminates the need for DRAM access is based on FeFETs and is purely
digital. The Multiply-and-Accumulate operation is performed using passive
resistors, gated by FeFETs. The resulting weight cell offers a high degree of
linearity and a large ON/OFF ratio. The key performance tradeoffs are
investigated, and the device requirements are elucidated.
"
998,Detection of Generalized Synchronization using Echo State Networks,"  Generalized synchronization between coupled dynamical systems is a phenomenon
of relevance in applications that range from secure communications to
physiological modelling. Here we test the capabilities of reservoir computing
and, in particular, echo state networks for the detection of generalized
synchronization. A nonlinear dynamical system consisting of two coupled
R\""ossler chaotic attractors is used to generate temporal series consisting of
time-locked generalized synchronized sequences interleaved by unsynchronized
ones. Correctly tuned, echo state networks are able to efficiently discriminate
between unsynchronized and synchronized sequences. Compared to other
state-of-the-art techniques of synchronization detection, the online
capabilities of the proposed ESN based methodology make it a promising choice
for real-time applications aiming to monitor dynamical synchronization changes
in continuous signals.
"
999,A Memristor-Based Optimization Framework for AI Applications,"  Memristors have recently received significant attention as ubiquitous
device-level components for building a novel generation of computing systems.
These devices have many promising features, such as non-volatility, low power
consumption, high density, and excellent scalability. The ability to control
and modify biasing voltages at the two terminals of memristors make them
promising candidates to perform matrix-vector multiplications and solve systems
of linear equations. In this article, we discuss how networks of memristors
arranged in crossbar arrays can be used for efficiently solving optimization
and machine learning problems. We introduce a new memristor-based optimization
framework that combines the computational merit of memristor crossbars with the
advantages of an operator splitting method, alternating direction method of
multipliers (ADMM). Here, ADMM helps in splitting a complex optimization
problem into subproblems that involve the solution of systems of linear
equations. The capability of this framework is shown by applying it to linear
programming, quadratic programming, and sparse optimization. In addition to
ADMM, implementation of a customized power iteration (PI) method for
eigenvalue/eigenvector computation using memristor crossbars is discussed. The
memristor-based PI method can further be applied to principal component
analysis (PCA). The use of memristor crossbars yields a significant speed-up in
computation, and thus, we believe, has the potential to advance optimization
and machine learning research in artificial intelligence (AI).
"
1000,"A Variable Length Coding Framework for Cost Function Reduction in
  Non-Volatile Memory Systems","  Variable length coding for Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) technologies is a
promising method to improve memory capacity and system performance through
compressing memory blocks. However, compression techniques used to improve
capacity or bandwidth utilization do not take into consideration the asymmetric
costs of writing 1's and 0's in NVMs. Taking into account this asymmetry, we
propose a variable length encoding framework that reduces the cost of writing
data into NVM. Our experimental results on 12 workloads of the SPEC CPU2006
benchmark suite show that, when the cost asymmetry is 1:2, the proposed
framework is capable of reducing the NVM programming cost by up to 24% more
than leading compression approaches and by 12.5% more than the flip-and-write
approach which selects between the data and its complement based on the
programming cost.
"
1001,"An Energy-Efficient Mixed-Signal Neuron for Inherently Error-Resilient
  Neuromorphic Systems","  This work presents the design and analysis of a mixed-signal neuron (MS-N)
for convolutional neural networks (CNN) and compares its performance with a
digital neuron (Dig-N) in terms of operating frequency, power and noise. The
circuit-level implementation of the MS-N in 65 nm CMOS technology exhibits 2-3
orders of magnitude better energy-efficiency over Dig-N for neuromorphic
computing applications - especially at low frequencies due to the high leakage
currents from many transistors in Dig-N. The inherent error-resiliency of CNN
is exploited to handle the thermal and flicker noise of MS-N. A system-level
analysis using a cohesive circuit-algorithmic framework on MNIST and CIFAR-10
datasets demonstrate an increase of 3% in worst-case classification error for
MNIST when the integrated noise power in the bandwidth is ~ 1 {\mu}V2.
"
1002,Runtime Fault Detection in Programmed Molecular Systems,"  Watchdog timers are devices that are commonly used to monitor the health of
safety-critical hardware and software systems. Their primary function is to
raise an alarm if the monitored systems fail to emit periodic ""heartbeats"" that
signal their well-being. In this paper we design and verify a molecular
watchdog timer for monitoring the health of programmed molecular nanosystems.
This raises new challenges because our molecular watchdog timer and the system
that it monitors both operate in the probabilistic environment of chemical
kinetics, where many failures are certain to occur and it is especially hard to
detect the absence of a signal.
  Our molecular watchdog timer is the result of an incremental design process
that uses goal-oriented requirements engineering, simulation, stochastic
analysis, and software verification tools. We demonstrate the molecular
watchdog's functionality by having it monitor a molecular oscillator. Both the
molecular watchdog timer and the oscillator are implemented as chemical
reaction networks, which are the current programming language of choice for
many molecular programming applications.
"
1003,"Impact of Random Receiver Orientation on Visible Light Communications
  Channel","  Visible Light Communications (VLC) has been studied thoroughly in recent
years as an alternative or complementary technology to radio frequency
communications. The reliability of VLC channels highly depends on the
availability and alignment of line of sight links. In this work, we study the
effect of random receiver orientation for mobile users over VLC downlink
channels, which affects the existence of line of sight links and the receiver
field of view. Based on the statistics of vertical receiver orientation and
user mobility, we develop a unified analytical framework to characterize the
statistical distribution of VLC downlink channels, which is then utilized to
obtain the outage probability and the bit error rate. Our analysis is
generalized for arbitrary distributions of receiver orientation/location for a
single transmitter, and extended to multiple transmitter case for certain
scenarios. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations show a perfect match between the
analytical and the simulation data in terms of both the statistical channel
distribution and the resulting bit error rate. Our results also characterize
the channel attenuation due to random receiver orientation/location for various
scenarios of interest.
"
1004,Diffusive Molecular Communications with Reactive Signaling,"  This paper focuses on molecular communication (MC) systems where the
signaling molecules may participate in a reversible bimolecular reaction in the
channel. The motivation for studying these MC systems is that they can realize
the concept of constructive and destructive signal superposition, which leads
to favorable properties such as inter-symbol interference (ISI) reduction and
avoiding environmental contamination due to continuous release of molecules
into the channel. This work first derives the maximum likelihood (ML) detector
for a binary MC system with reactive signaling molecules under the assumption
that the detector has perfect knowledge of the ISI. The performance of this
genie-aided ML detector yields an upper bound on the performance of any
practical detector. In addition, two suboptimal detectors of different
complexity are proposed. The proposed ML detector as well as one of the
suboptimal detectors require the channel response (CR) of the considered MC
system. Moreover, the CR is needed for the performance evaluation of all
proposed detectors. However, analyzing MC with reactive signaling is
challenging since the underlying partial differential equations that describe
the reaction-diffusion mechanism are coupled and non-linear. Therefore, an
algorithm is developed in this paper for efficient computation of the CR to any
arbitrary transmit symbol sequence. The accuracy of this algorithm is validated
via particle-based simulation. Simulation results using the developed CR
algorithm show that the performance of the proposed suboptimal detectors can
approach that of the genie- aided ML detector. Moreover, these results show
that MC systems with reactive signaling have superior performance relative to
those with non-reactive signaling due to the reduction of ISI enabled by the
chemical reactions.

1005,"Towards Hardware Implementation of Double-Layer Perceptron Based on
  Metal-Oxide Memristive Nanostructures","  Construction and training principles have been proposed and tested for an
artificial neural network based on metal-oxide thin-film nanostructures
possessing bipolar resistive switching (memristive) effect. Experimental
electronic circuit of neural network is implemented as a double-layer
perceptron with a weight matrix composed of 32 memristive devices. The network
training algorithm takes into account technological variations of the
parameters of memristive nanostructures. Despite the limited size of weight
matrix the developed neural network model is well scalable and capable of
solving nonlinear classification problems.
"
1006,"Spintronics based Stochastic Computing for Efficient Bayesian Inference
  System","  Bayesian inference is an effective approach for solving statistical learning
problems especially with uncertainty and incompleteness. However, inference
efficiencies are physically limited by the bottlenecks of conventional
computing platforms. In this paper, an emerging Bayesian inference system is
proposed by exploiting spintronics based stochastic computing. A stochastic
bitstream generator is realized as the kernel components by leveraging the
inherent randomness of spintronics devices. The proposed system is evaluated by
typical applications of data fusion and Bayesian belief networks. Simulation
results indicate that the proposed approach could achieve significant
improvement on inference efficiencies in terms of power consumption and
inference speed.
"
1007,Modeling Duct Flow for Molecular Communication,"  Active transport such as fluid flow is sought in molecular communication to
extend coverage, improve reliability, and mitigate interference. Flow models
are often over-simplified, assuming one-dimensional diffusion with constant
drift. However, diffusion and flow are usually encountered in three-dimensional
bounded environments where the flow is highly non-uniform such as in blood
vessels or microfluidic channels. For a qualitative understanding of the
relevant physical effects inherent to these channels, based on the Peclet
number and the transmitter-receiver distance, we study when simplified models
of uniform flow and advection-only transport are applicable. For these two
regimes, analytical expressions for the channel impulse response are derived
and validated by particle-based simulation. Furthermore, as advection-only
transport is typically overlooked and hence not analyzed in the molecular
communication literature, we evaluate the symbol error rate for exemplary
on-off keying as performance metric.
"
1008,"Encoding Neural and Synaptic Functionalities in Electron Spin: A Pathway
  to Efficient Neuromorphic Computing","  Present day computers expend orders of magnitude more computational resources
to perform various cognitive and perception related tasks that humans routinely
perform everyday. This has recently resulted in a seismic shift in the field of
computation where research efforts are being directed to develop a
neurocomputer that attempts to mimic the human brain by nanoelectronic
components and thereby harness its efficiency in recognition problems. Bridging
the gap between neuroscience and nanoelectronics, this paper attempts to
provide a review of the recent developments in the field of spintronic device
based neuromorphic computing. Description of various spin-transfer torque
mechanisms that can be potentially utilized for realizing device structures
mimicking neural and synaptic functionalities is provided. A cross-layer
perspective extending from the device to the circuit and system level is
presented to envision the design of an All-Spin neuromorphic processor enabled
with on-chip learning functionalities. Device-circuit-algorithm co-simulation
framework calibrated to experimental results suggest that such All-Spin
neuromorphic systems can potentially achieve almost two orders of magnitude
energy improvement in comparison to state-of-the-art CMOS implementations.

1009,"Beyond-CMOS Device Benchmarking for Boolean and Non-Boolean Logic
  Applications","  The latest results of benchmarking research are presented for a variety of
beyond-CMOS charge- and spin-based devices. In addition to improving the
device-level models, several new device proposals and a few majorly modified
devices are investigated. Deep pipelining circuits are employed to boost the
throughput of low-power devices. Furthermore, the benchmarking methodology is
extended to interconnect-centric analyses and non-Boolean logic applications.
In contrast to Boolean circuits, non-Boolean circuits based on the cellular
neural network demonstrate that spintronic devices can potentially outperform
conventional CMOS devices.
"
1010,Neuromorphic computing with multi-memristive synapses,"  Neuromorphic computing has emerged as a promising avenue towards building the
next generation of intelligent computing systems. It has been proposed that
memristive devices, which exhibit history-dependent conductivity modulation,
could efficiently represent the synaptic weights in artificial neural networks.
However, precise modulation of the device conductance over a wide dynamic
range, necessary to maintain high network accuracy, is proving to be
challenging. To address this, we present a multi-memristive synaptic
architecture with an efficient global counter-based arbitration scheme. We
focus on phase change memory devices, develop a comprehensive model and
demonstrate via simulations the effectiveness of the concept for both spiking
and non-spiking neural networks. Moreover, we present experimental results
involving over a million phase change memory devices for unsupervised learning
of temporal correlations using a spiking neural network. The work presents a
significant step towards the realization of large-scale and energy-efficient
neuromorphic computing systems.
"
1011,A Compact CMOS Memristor Emulator Circuit and its Applications,"  Conceptual memristors have recently gathered wider interest due to their
diverse application in non-von Neumann computing, machine learning,
neuromorphic computing, and chaotic circuits. We introduce a compact CMOS
circuit that emulates idealized memristor characteristics and can bridge the
gap between concepts to chip-scale realization by transcending device
challenges. The CMOS memristor circuit embodies a two-terminal variable
resistor whose resistance is controlled by the voltage applied across its
terminals. The memristor 'state' is held in a capacitor that controls the
resistor value. This work presents the design and simulation of the memristor
emulation circuit, and applies it to a memcomputing application of maze solving
using analog parallelism. Furthermore, the memristor emulator circuit can be
designed and fabricated using standard commercial CMOS technologies and opens
doors to interesting applications in neuromorphic and machine learning
circuits.
"
1012,"SPARE: Spiking Networks Acceleration Using CMOS ROM-Embedded RAM as an
  In-Memory-Computation Primitive","  Despite huge success of artificial intelligence, hardware systems running
these algorithms consume orders of magnitude higher energy compared to the
human brain, mainly due to heavy data movements between the memory unit and the
computation cores. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) built using bio-plausible
neuron and synaptic models have emerged as the power-efficient choice for
designing cognitive applications. These algorithms involve several lookup-table
(LUT) based function evaluations such as high-order polynomials and
transcendental functions for solving complex neuro-synaptic models, that
typically require additional storage. To that effect, we propose `SPARE' - an
in-memory, distributed processing architecture built on ROM-embedded RAM
technology, for accelerating SNNs. ROM-embedded RAMs allow storage of LUTs,
embedded within a typical memory array, without additional area overhead. Our
proposed architecture consists of a 2-D array of Processing Elements (PEs).
Since most of the computations are done locally within each PE, unnecessary
data transfers are restricted, thereby alleviating the von-Neumann bottleneck.
We evaluate SPARE for two different ROM-Embedded RAM structures - CMOS based
ROM-Embedded SRAMs (R-SRAMs) and STT-MRAM based ROM-Embedded MRAMs (R-MRAMs).
Moreover, we analyze trade-offs in terms of energy, area and performance, for
using the two technologies on a range of image classification benchmarks.
Furthermore, we leverage the additional storage density to implement complex
neuro-synaptic functionalities. This enhances the utility of the proposed
architecture by provisioning implementation of any neuron/synaptic behavior as
necessitated by the application. Our results show up-to 1.75x, 1.95x and 1.95x
improvement in energy, iso-storage area, and iso-area performance,
respectively, by using neural network accelerators built on ROM-embedded RAM
primitives.
"
1013,On the Geometry of Stabilizer States,"  Large-scale quantum computation is likely to require massive quantum error
correction (QEC). QEC codes and circuits are described via the stabilizer
formalism, which represents stabilizer states by keeping track of the operators
that preserve them. Such states are obtained by stabilizer circuits (consisting
of CNOT, Hadamard and Phase gates) and can be represented compactly on
conventional computers using $O(n^2)$ bits, where $n$ is the number of qubits.
As an additional application, the work by Aaronson and Gottesman suggests the
use of superpositions of stabilizer states to represent arbitrary quantum
states. To aid in such applications and improve our understanding of stabilizer
states, we characterize and count nearest-neighbor stabilizer states, quantify
the distribution of angles between pairs of stabilizer states, study succinct
stabilizer superpositions and stabilizer bivectors, explore the approximation
of non-stabilizer states by single stabilizer states and short linear
combinations of stabilizer states, develop an improved inner-product
computation for stabilizer states via synthesis of compact canonical stabilizer
circuits, propose an orthogonalization procedure for stabilizer states, and
evaluate several of these algorithms empirically.

use of Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations of biological systems. The MD
methodology has allowed to explain and discover molecular mechanisms in a wide
range of natural processes. There is an impending need to readily share the
ever-increasing amount of MD data, which has been hindered by the lack of
specialized tools in the past. To solve this problem, we present HTMoL, a

1016,"Clocked Magnetostriction-Assisted Spintronic Device Design and
  Simulation","  We propose a heterostructure device comprised of magnets and piezoelectrics
that significantly improves the delay and the energy dissipation of an all-spin
logic (ASL) device. This paper studies and models the physics of the device,
illustrates its operation, and benchmarks its performance using SPICE
simulations. We show that the proposed device maintains low voltage operation,
non-reciprocity, non-volatility, cascadability, and thermal reliability of the
original ASL device. Moreover, by utilizing the deterministic switching of a
magnet from the saddle point of the energy profile, the device is more
efficient in terms of energy and delay and is robust to thermal fluctuations.
The results of simulations show that compared to ASL devices, the proposed
device achieves 21x shorter delay and 27x lower energy dissipation per bit for
a 32-bit arithmetic-logic unit (ALU).

1017,"Technology Aware Training in Memristive Neuromorphic Systems based on
  non-ideal Synaptic Crossbars","  The advances in the field of machine learning using neuromorphic systems have
paved the pathway for extensive research on possibilities of hardware
implementations of neural networks. Various memristive technologies such as
oxide-based devices, spintronics and phase change materials have been explored
to implement the core functional units of neuromorphic systems, namely the
synaptic network, and the neuronal functionality, in a fast and energy
efficient manner. However, various non-idealities in the crossbar
implementations of the synaptic arrays can significantly degrade performance of
neural networks and hence, impose restrictions on feasible crossbar sizes. In
this work, we build mathematical models of various non-idealities that occur in
crossbar implementations such as source resistance, neuron resistance and
chip-to-chip device variations and analyze their impact on the classification
accuracy of a fully connected network (FCN) and convolutional neural network
(CNN) trained with standard training algorithm. We show that a network trained
under ideal conditions can suffer accuracy degradation as large as 59.84% for
FCNs and 62.4% for CNNs when implemented on non-ideal crossbars for relevant
non-ideality ranges. This severely constrains the sizes for crossbars. As a
solution, we propose a technology aware training algorithm which incorporates
the mathematical models of the non-idealities in the standard training
algorithm. We demonstrate that our proposed methodology achieves significant
recovery of testing accuracy within 1.9% of the ideal accuracy for FCNs and
1.5% for CNNs. We further show that our proposed training algorithm can
potentially allow the use of significantly larger crossbar arrays of sizes
784$\times$500 for FCNs and 4096$\times$512 for CNNs with a minor or no
trade-off in accuracy

1018,A Fowler-Nordheim Integrator can Track the Density of Prime Numbers,"  ""Does there exist a naturally occurring counting device that might elucidate
the hidden structure of prime numbers ?"" is a question that has fascinated
computer scientists and mathematical physicists for decades. While most recent
research in this area have explored the role of the Riemann zeta-function in
different formulations of statistical mechanics, condensed matter physics and
quantum chaotic systems, the resulting devices (quantum or classical) have only
existed in theory or the fabrication of the device has been found to be not
scalable to large prime numbers. Here we report for the first time that any
hypothetical prime number generator, to our knowledge, has to be a special case
of a dynamical system that is governed by the physics of Fowler-Nordheim (FN)
quantum-tunneling. In this paper we report how such a dynamical system can be
implemented using a counting process that naturally arises from sequential FN
tunneling and integration of electrons on a floating-gate (FG) device. The
self-compensating physics of the FG device makes the operation reliable and
repeatable even when tunneling-currents approach levels below 1 attoamperes. We
report measured results from different variants of fabricated prototypes, each
of which shows an excellent match with the asymptotic prime number statistics.
We also report similarities between the spectral signatures produced by the FN
device and the spectral statistics of a hypothetical prime number sequence
generator. We believe that the proposed floating-gate device could have future
implications in understanding the process that generates prime numbers with
applications in security and authentication.

1019,"Integrated Nanophotonics Architecture for Residue Number System
  Arithmetic","  Residue number system (RNS) enables dimensionality reduction of an arithmetic
problem by representing a large number as a set of smaller integers, where the
number is decomposed by prime number factorization using the moduli as basic
functions. These reduced problem sets can then be processed independently and
in parallel, thus improving computational efficiency and speed. Here we show an
optical RNS hardware representation based on integrated nanophotonics. The
digit-wise shifting in RNS arithmetic is expressed as spatial routing of an
optical signal in 2x2 hybrid photonic-plasmonic switches. Here the residue is
represented by spatially shifting the input waveguides relative to the routers
outputs, where the moduli are represented by the number of waveguides. By
cascading the photonic 2x2 switches, we design a photonic RNS adder and a
multiplier forming an all-to-all sparse directional network. The advantage of
this photonic arithmetic processor is the short (10's ps) computational
execution time given by the optical propagation delay through the integrated
nanophotonic router. Furthermore, we show how photonic processing
in-the-network leverages the natural parallelism of optics such as
wavelength-division-multiplexing or optical angular momentum in this RNS
processor. A key application for photonic RNS is the functional analysis
convolution with widespread usage in numerical linear algebra, computer vision,
language- image- and signal processing, and neural networks.

own true cognition, just automated biochemical mechanisms. To ""rehabilitate""
the slime mould from the rank of a purely living electronics element to a
""creature of thoughts"" we are analyzing the cognitive potential of P.
polycephalum. We base our theory of minimal cognition of the slime mould on a
bottom-up approach, from the biological and biophysical nature of the slime
mould and its regulatory systems using frameworks suh as Lyon's biogenic
cognition, Muller, di Primio-Lengeler\'s modifiable pathways, Bateson's
""patterns that connect"" framework, Maturana's autopoetic network, or
proto-consciousness and Morgan's Canon.

1021,"Mixed-precision training of deep neural networks using computational
  memory","  Deep neural networks have revolutionized the field of machine learning by
providing unprecedented human-like performance in solving many real-world
problems such as image and speech recognition. Training of large DNNs, however,
is a computationally intensive task, and this necessitates the development of
novel computing architectures targeting this application. A computational
memory unit where resistive memory devices are organized in crossbar arrays can
be used to locally store the synaptic weights in their conductance states. The
expensive multiply accumulate operations can be performed in place using
Kirchhoff's circuit laws in a non-von Neumann manner. However, a key challenge
remains the inability to alter the conductance states of the devices in a
reliable manner during the weight update process. We propose a mixed-precision
architecture that combines a computational memory unit storing the synaptic
weights with a digital processing unit and an additional memory unit
accumulating weight updates in high precision. The new architecture delivers
classification accuracies comparable to those of floating-point implementations
without being constrained by challenges associated with the non-ideal weight
update characteristics of emerging resistive memories. A two layer neural
network in which the computational memory unit is realized using non-linear
stochastic models of phase-change memory devices achieves a test accuracy of
97.40% on the MNIST handwritten digit classification problem.
"
1022,"Particle Computation: Complexity, Algorithms, and Logic","  We investigate algorithmic control of a large swarm of mobile particles (such
as robots, sensors, or building material) that move in a 2D workspace using a
global input signal (such as gravity or a magnetic field). We show that a maze
of obstacles to the environment can be used to create complex systems. We
provide a wide range of results for a wide range of questions. These can be
subdivided into external algorithmic problems, in which particle configurations
serve as input for computations that are performed elsewhere, and internal
logic problems, in which the particle configurations themselves are used for
carrying out computations. For external algorithms, we give both negative and
positive results. If we are given a set of stationary obstacles, we prove that
it is NP-hard to decide whether a given initial configuration of unit-sized
particles can be transformed into a desired target configuration. Moreover, we
show that finding a control sequence of minimum length is PSPACE-complete. We
also work on the inverse problem, providing constructive algorithms to design
workspaces that efficiently implement arbitrary permutations between different
configurations. For internal logic, we investigate how arbitrary computations
can be implemented. We demonstrate how to encode dual-rail logic to build a
universal logic gate that concurrently evaluates and, nand, nor, and or
operations. Using many of these gates and appropriate interconnects, we can
evaluate any logical expression. However, we establish that simulating the full
range of complex interactions present in arbitrary digital circuits encounters
a fundamental difficulty: a fan-out gate cannot be generated. We resolve this
missing component with the help of 2x1 particles, which can create fan-out
gates that produce multiple copies of the inputs. Using these gates we provide
rules for replicating arbitrary digital circuits.
"
1023,"Implementation of Multilayer Perceptron Network with Highly Uniform
  Passive Memristive Crossbar Circuits","  The progress in the field of neural computation hinges on the use of hardware
more efficient than the conventional microprocessors. Recent works have shown
that mixed-signal integrated memristive circuits, especially their passive
('0T1R') variety, may increase the neuromorphic network performance
dramatically, leaving far behind their digital counterparts. The major
obstacle, however, is relatively immature memristor technology so that only
limited functionality has been demonstrated to date. Here we experimentally
demonstrate operation of one-hidden layer perceptron classifier entirely in the
mixed-signal integrated hardware, comprised of two passive 20x20 metal-oxide
memristive crossbar arrays, board-integrated with discrete CMOS components. The
demonstrated multilayer perceptron network, whose complexity is almost 10x
higher as compared to previously reported functional neuromorphic classifiers
based on passive memristive circuits, achieves classification fidelity within 3
percent of that obtained in simulations, when using ex-situ training approach.
The successful demonstration was facilitated by improvements in fabrication
technology of memristors, specifically by lowering variations in their I-V
characteristics.
"
1024,Quantum Accelerators for High-Performance Computing Systems,"  We define some of the programming and system-level challenges facing the
application of quantum processing to high-performance computing. Alongside
barriers to physical integration, prominent differences in the execution of
quantum and conventional programs challenges the intersection of these
computational models. Following a brief overview of the state of the art, we
discuss recent advances in programming and execution models for hybrid
quantum-classical computing. We discuss a novel quantum-accelerator framework
that uses specialized kernels to offload select workloads while integrating
with existing computing infrastructure. We elaborate on the role of the host
operating system to manage these unique accelerator resources, the prospects
for deploying quantum modules, and the requirements placed on the language
hierarchy connecting these different system components. We draw on recent
advances in the modeling and simulation of quantum computing systems with the
development of architectures for hybrid high-performance computing systems and
the realization of software stacks for controlling quantum devices. Finally, we
present simulation results that describe the expected system-level behavior of
high-performance computing systems composed from compute nodes with quantum
processing units. We describe performance for these hybrid systems in terms of
time-to-solution, accuracy, and energy consumption, and we use simple
application examples to estimate the performance advantage of quantum
acceleration.
"
1025,"An All-Memristor Deep Spiking Neural Computing System: A Step Towards
  Realizing the Low Power,Stochastic Brain","  Deep 'Analog Artificial Neural Networks' (ANNs) perform complex
classification problems with remarkably high accuracy. However, they rely on
humongous amount of power to perform the calculations, veiling the accuracy
benefits. The biological brain on the other hand is significantly more powerful
than such networks and consumes orders of magnitude less power, indicating us
about some conceptual mismatch. Given that the biological neurons communicate
using energy efficient trains of spikes, and the behavior is non-deterministic,
incorporating these effects in Deep Artificial Neural Networks may drive us few
steps towards a more realistic neuron. In this work, we propose how the
inherent stochasticity of nano-scale resistive devices can be harnessed to
emulate the functionality of a spiking neuron that can be incorporated in deep
stochastic Spiking Neural Networks (SNN). At the algorithmic level, we propose
how the training can be modified to convert an ANN to an SNN while supporting
the stochastic activation function offered by these devices. We devise circuit
architectures to incorporate stochastic memristive neurons along with
memristive crossbars which perform the functionality of the synaptic weights.
We tested the proposed All Memristor deep stochastic SNN for image
classification and observed only about 1% degradation in accuracy with the ANN
baseline after incorporating the circuit and device related non-idealities. We
witnessed that the network is robust to certain variations and consumes ~ 6.4x
less energy than its CMOS counterpart.
"
1026,Applications of Biological Cell Models in Robotics,"  In this paper I present some of the most representative biological models
applied to robotics. In particular, this work represents a survey of some
models inspired, or making use of concepts, by gene regulatory networks (GRNs):
these networks describe the complex interactions that affect gene expression
and, consequently, cell behaviour.
"
1027,Design of Efficient Reversible Logic Based Binary and BCD Adder Circuits,"  In this work, we present a class of new designs for reversible binary and BCD
adder circuits. The proposed designs are primarily optimized for the number of
ancilla inputs and the number of garbage outputs and are designed for possible
best values for the quantum cost and delay. First, we propose two new designs
for the reversible ripple carry adder: (i) one with no input carry $c_0$ and no
ancilla input bits, and (ii) one with input carry $c_0$ and no ancilla input
bits. The proposed reversible ripple carry adder designs with no ancilla input
bits have less quantum cost and logic depth (delay) compared to their existing
counterparts in the literature. In these designs, the quantum cost and delay
are reduced by deriving designs based on the reversible Peres gate and the TR
gate. Next, four new designs for the reversible BCD adder are presented based
on the following two approaches: (i) the addition is performed in binary mode
and correction is applied to convert to BCD when required through detection and
correction, and (ii) the addition is performed in binary mode and the result is
always converted using a binary to BCD converter. The proposed reversible
binary and BCD adders can be applied in a wide variety of digital signal
processing applications and constitute important design components of
reversible computing.
"
1028,Physarum-inspired Network Optimization: A Review,"  The popular Physarum-inspired Algorithms (PAs) have the potential to solve
challenging network optimization problems. However, the existing researches on
PAs are still immature and far from being fully recognized. A major reason is
that these researches have not been well organized so far. In this paper, we
aim to address this issue. First, we introduce Physarum and its intelligence
from the biological perspective. Then, we summarize and group four types of
Physarum-inspired networking models. After that, we analyze the network
optimization problems and applications that have been challenged by PAs based
on these models. Ultimately, we discuss the existing researches on PAs and
identify two fundamental questions: 1) What are the characteristics of Physarum
networks? 2) Why can Physarum solve some network optimization problems?
Answering these two questions is essential to the future development of
Physarum-inspired network optimization.
"
1029,"When the path is never shortest: a reality check on shortest path
  biocomputation","  Shortest path problems are a touchstone for evaluating the computing
performance and functional range of novel computing substrates. Much has been
published in recent years regarding the use of biocomputers to solve minimal
path problems such as route optimisation and labyrinth navigation, but their
outputs are typically difficult to reproduce and somewhat abstract in nature,
suggesting that both experimental design and analysis in the field require
standardising. This chapter details laboratory experimental data which probe
the path finding process in two single-celled protistic model organisms,
Physarum polycephalum and Paramecium caudatum, comprising a shortest path
problem and labyrinth navigation, respectively. The results presented
illustrate several of the key difficulties that are encountered in categorising
biological behaviours in the language of computing, including biological
variability, non-halting operations and adverse reactions to experimental
stimuli. It is concluded that neither organism examined are able to efficiently
or reproducibly solve shortest path problems in the specific experimental
conditions that were tested. Data presented are contextualised with biological
theory and design principles for maximising the usefulness of experimental
biocomputer prototypes.
"
1030,Weighted p-bits for FPGA implementation of probabilistic circuits,"  Probabilistic spin logic (PSL) is a recently proposed computing paradigm
based on unstable stochastic units called probabilistic bits (p-bits) that can
be correlated to form probabilistic circuits (p-circuits). These p-circuits can
be used to solve problems of optimization, inference and also to implement
precise Boolean functions in an ""inverted"" mode, where a given Boolean circuit
can operate in reverse to find the input combinations that are consistent with
a given output. In this paper we present a scalable FPGA implementation of such
invertible p-circuits. We implement a ""weighted"" p-bit that combines stochastic
units with localized memory structures. We also present a generalized tile of
weighted p-bits to which a large class of problems beyond invertible Boolean
logic can be mapped, and how invertibility can be applied to interesting
problems such as the NP-complete Subset Sum Problem by solving a small instance
of this problem in hardware.
"
1031,Maze solvers demystified and some other thoughts,"  There is a growing interest towards implementation of maze solving in
spatially-extended physical, chemical and living systems. Several reports of
prototypes attracted great publicity, e.g. maze solving with slime mould and
epithelial cells, maze navigating droplets. We show that most prototypes
utilise one of two phenomena: a shortest path in a maze is a path of the least
resistance for fluid and current flow, and a shortest path is a path of the
steepest gradient of chemoattractants. We discuss that substrates with
so-called maze-solving capabilities simply trace flow currents or chemical
diffusion gradients. We illustrate our thoughts with a model of flow and
experiments with slime mould. The chapter ends with a discussion of experiments
on maze solving with plant roots and leeches which show limitations of the
chemical diffusion maze-solving approach.
"
1032,"X-SRAM: Enabling In-Memory Boolean Computations in CMOS Static Random
  Access Memories","  Silicon-based Static Random Access Memories (SRAM) and digital Boolean logic
have been the workhorse of the state-of-art computing platforms. Despite
tremendous strides in scaling the ubiquitous metal-oxide-semiconductor
transistor, the underlying \textit{von-Neumann} computing architecture has
remained unchanged. The limited throughput and energy-efficiency of the
state-of-art computing systems, to a large extent, results from the well-known
\textit{von-Neumann bottleneck}. The energy and throughput inefficiency of the
von-Neumann machines have been accentuated in recent times due to the present
emphasis on data-intensive applications like artificial intelligence, machine
learning \textit{etc}. A possible approach towards mitigating the overhead
associated with the von-Neumann bottleneck is to enable \textit{in-memory}
Boolean computations. In this manuscript, we present an augmented version of
the conventional SRAM bit-cells, called \textit{the X-SRAM}, with the ability
to perform in-memory, vector Boolean computations, in addition to the usual
memory storage operations. We propose at least six different schemes for
enabling in-memory vector computations including NAND, NOR, IMP (implication),
XOR logic gates with respect to different bit-cell topologies $-$ the 8T cell
and the 8$^+$T Differential cell. In addition, we also present a novel
\textit{`read-compute-store'} scheme, wherein the computed Boolean function can
be directly stored in the memory without the need of latching the data and
carrying out a subsequent write operation. The feasibility of the proposed
schemes has been verified using predictive transistor models and Monte-Carlo
variation analysis.
"
1033,Design of Quantum Annealing Machine for Prime Factoring,"  We propose a prime factoring machine operated in a frame work of quantum
annealing (QA). The idea is inverse operation of a quantum-mechanically
reversible multiplier implemented with QA-based Boolean logic circuits. We
designed the QA machine on an application-specific-annealing-computing
architecture which efficiently increases available hardware budgets at the cost
of restricted functionality. The circuits are to be implemented and fabricated
by using superconducting integrated circuit technology. We propose a
three-dimensional packaging scheme of a qubit-chip / interposer /
package-substrate structure for realizing practically-large scale QA systems.
"
1034,"Mitigating Asymmetric Nonlinear Weight Update Effects in Hardware Neural
  Network based on Analog Resistive Synapse","  Asymmetric nonlinear weight update is considered as one of the major
obstacles for realizing hardware neural networks based on analog resistive
synapses because it significantly compromises the online training capability.
This paper provides new solutions to this critical issue through
co-optimization with the hardware-applicable deep-learning algorithms. New
insights on engineering activation functions and a threshold weight update
scheme effectively suppress the undesirable training noise induced by
inaccurate weight update. We successfully trained a two-layer perceptron
network online and improved the classification accuracy of MNIST handwritten
digit dataset to 87.8/94.8% by using 6-bit/8-bit analog synapses, respectively,
with extremely high asymmetric nonlinearity.
"
1035,Asymptotic behavior of memristive circuits,"  The interest in memristors has risen due to their possible application both
as memory units and as computational devices in combination with CMOS. This is
in part due to their nonlinear dynamics, and a strong dependence on the circuit
topology. We provide evidence that also purely memristive circuits can be
employed for computational purposes. In the present paper we show that a
polynomial Lyapunov function in the memory parameters exists for the case of DC
controlled memristors. Such Lyapunov function can be asymptotically
approximated with binary variables, and mapped to quadratic combinatorial
optimization problems. This also shows a direct parallel between memristive
circuits and the Hopfield-Little model. In the case of Erdos-Renyi random
circuits, we show numerically that the distribution of the matrix elements of
the projectors can be roughly approximated with a Gaussian distribution, and
that it scales with the inverse square root of the number of elements. This
provides an approximated but direct connection with the physics of disordered
system and, in particular, of mean field spin glasses. Using this and the fact
that the interaction is controlled by a projector operator on the loop space of
the circuit. We estimate the number of stationary points of the approximate
Lyapunov function and provide a scaling formula as an upper bound in terms of
the circuit topology only.
"
1036,"Energy-efficient Hybrid CMOS-NEMS LIF Neuron Circuit in 28 nm CMOS
  Process","  Designing analog sub-threshold neuromorphic circuits in deep sub-micron
technologies e.g. 28 nm can be a daunting task due to the problem of excessive
leakage current. We propose novel energy-efficient hybrid CMOS-nano
electro-mechanical switches (NEMS) Leaky Integrate and Fire (LIF) neuron and
synapse circuits and investigate the impact of NEM switches on the leakage
power and overall energy consumption. We analyze the performance of
biologically-inspired neuron circuit in terms of leakage power consumption and
present new energy-efficient neural circuits that operate with biologically
plausible firing rates. Our results show the proposed CMOS-NEMS neuron circuit
is, on average, 35% more energy-efficient than its CMOS counterpart with same
complexity in 28 nm process. Moreover, we discuss how NEM switches can be
utilized to further improve the scalability of mixed-signal neuromorphic
circuits.
"
1037,"Molecular Signal Modeling of a Partially Counting Absorbing Spherical
  Receiver","  To communicate at the nanoscale, researchers have proposed molecular
communication as an energy-efficient solution. The drawback to this solution is
that the histogram of the molecules' hitting times, which constitute the
molecular signal at the receiver, has a heavy tail. Reducing the effects of
this heavy tail, inter-symbol interference (ISI), has been the focus of most
prior research. In this paper, a novel way of decreasing the ISI by defining a
counting region on the spherical receiver's surface facing towards the
transmitter node is proposed. The beneficial effect comes from the fact that
the molecules received from the back lobe of the receiver are more likely to be
coming through longer paths that contribute to ISI. In order to justify this
idea, the joint distribution of the arrival molecules with respect to angle and
time is derived. Using this distribution, the channel model function is
approximated for the proposed system, i.e., the partially counting absorbing
spherical receiver. After validating the channel model function, the
characteristics of the molecular signal are investigated and improved
performance is presented. Moreover, the optimal counting region in terms of bit
error rate is found analytically.
"
1038,"T-count and Qubit Optimized Quantum Circuit Design of the Non-Restoring
  Square Root Algorithm","  Quantum circuits for basic mathematical functions such as the square root are
required to implement scientific computing algorithms on quantum computers.
Quantum circuits that are based on Clifford+T gates can easily be made fault
tolerant but the T gate is very costly to implement. As a result, reducing
T-count has become an important optimization goal. Further, quantum circuits
with many qubits are difficult to realize, making designs that save qubits and
produce no garbage outputs desirable. In this work, we present a T-count
optimized quantum square root circuit with only $2 \cdot n +1$ qubits and no
garbage output. To make a fair comparison against existing work, the Bennett's
garbage removal scheme is used to remove garbage output from existing works. We
determined that our proposed design achieves an average T-count savings of
$43.44 \%$, $98.95 \%$, $41.06 \%$ and $20.28 \%$ as well as qubit savings of
$85.46 \%$, $95.16 \%$, $90.59 \%$ and $86.77 \%$ compared to existing works.
"
1039,On the Universality of Memcomputing Machines,"  Universal memcomputing machines (UMMs) [IEEE Trans. Neural Netw. Learn. Syst.
26, 2702 (2015)] represent a novel computational model in which memory (time
non-locality) accomplishes both tasks of storing and processing of information.
UMMs have been shown to be Turing-complete, namely they can simulate any Turing
machine. In this paper, using set theory and cardinality arguments, we compare
them with liquid-state machines (or ""reservoir computing"") and quantum machines
(""quantum computing""). We show that UMMs can simulate both types of machines,
hence they are both ""liquid-"" or ""reservoir-complete"" and ""quantum-complete"".
Of course, these statements pertain only to the type of problems these machines
can solve, and not to the amount of resources required for such simulations.
Nonetheless, the method presented here provides a general framework in which to
describe the relation between UMMs and any other type of computational model.
"
1040,"Stable Self-Assembled Atomic-Switch Networks for Neuromorphic
  Applications","  Nature inspired neuromorphic architectures are being explored as an
alternative to imminent limitations of conventional complementary metal-oxide
semiconductor (CMOS) architectures. Utilization of such architectures for
practical applications like advanced pattern recognition tasks will require
synaptic connections that are both reconfigurable and stable. Here, we report
realization of stable atomic-switch networks (ASN), with inherent complex
connectivity, self-assembled from percolating metal nanoparticles (NPs). The
device conductance reflects the configuration of synapses which can be
modulated via voltage stimulus. By controlling Relative Humidity (RH) and
oxygen partial-pressure during NP deposition we obtain stochastic conductance
switching that is stable over several months. Detailed characterization reveals
signatures of electric-field induced atomic-wire formation within the
tunnel-gaps of the oxidized percolating network. Finally we show that the
synaptic structure can be reconfigured by stimulating at different repetition
rates, which can be utilized as short-term to long-term memory conversion. This
demonstration of stable stochastic switching in ASNs provides a promising route
to hardware implementation of biological neuronal models and, as an example, we
highlight possible applications in Reservoir Computing (RC).
"
1041,Principles of Neuromorphic Photonics,"  In an age overrun with information, the ability to process reams of data has
become crucial. The demand for data will continue to grow as smart gadgets
multiply and become increasingly integrated into our daily lives.
Next-generation industries in artificial intelligence services and
high-performance computing are so far supported by microelectronic platforms.
These data-intensive enterprises rely on continual improvements in hardware.
Their prospects are running up against a stark reality: conventional
one-size-fits-all solutions offered by digital electronics can no longer
satisfy this need, as Moore's law (exponential hardware scaling),
interconnection density, and the von Neumann architecture reach their limits.
  With its superior speed and reconfigurability, analog photonics can provide
some relief to these problems; however, complex applications of analog
photonics have remained largely unexplored due to the absence of a robust
photonic integration industry. Recently, the landscape for
commercially-manufacturable photonic chips has been changing rapidly and now
promises to achieve economies of scale previously enjoyed solely by
microelectronics.
  The scientific community has set out to build bridges between the domains of
photonic device physics and neural networks, giving rise to the field of
\emph{neuromorphic photonics}. This article reviews the recent progress in
integrated neuromorphic photonics. We provide an overview of neuromorphic
computing, discuss the associated technology (microelectronic and photonic)
platforms and compare their metric performance. We discuss photonic neural
network approaches and challenges for integrated neuromorphic photonic
processors while providing an in-depth description of photonic neurons and a
candidate interconnection architecture. We conclude with a future outlook of
neuro-inspired photonic processing.
"
1042,Level-Shifted Neural Encoded Analog-to-Digital Converter,"  This paper presents the new approach in implementation of analog-to-digital
converter (ADC) that is based on Hopfield neural-network architecture. Hopfield
neural ADC (NADC) is a type of recurrent neural network that is effective in
solving simple optimization problems, such as analog-to-digital conversion. The
main idea behind the proposed design is to use multiple 2-bit Hopfield NADCs
operating as quantizers in parallel, where analog input signal to each
successive 2-bit Hopfield ADC block is passed through a voltage level shifter.
This is followed by a neural network encoder to remove the quantization errors.
In traditional Hopfield NADC based designs, increasing the number of bits could
require proper scaling of the network parameters, in particular digital output
operating region. Furthermore, the resolution improvement of traditional
Hopfield NADC creates digital error that increases with the increasing number
of bits. The proposed design is scalable in number of bits and number of
quantization levels, and can maintain the magnitude of digital output code
within a manageable operating voltage range.
"
1043,Implementing Bayesian Networks with Embedded Stochastic MRAM,"  Magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJ's) with low barrier magnets have been used to
implement random number generators (RNG's) and it has recently been shown that
such an MTJ connected to the drain of a conventional transistor provides a
three-terminal tunable RNG or a $p$-bit. In this letter we show how this
$p$-bit can be used to build a $p$-circuit that emulates a Bayesian network
(BN), such that the correlations in real world variables can be obtained from
electrical measurements on the corresponding circuit nodes. The $p$-circuit
design proceeds in two steps: the BN is first translated into a behavioral
model, called Probabilistic Spin Logic (PSL), defined by dimensionless biasing
(h) and interconnection (J) coefficients, which are then translated into
electronic circuit elements. As a benchmark example, we mimic a family tree of
three generations and show that the genetic relatedness calculated from a
SPICE-compatible circuit simulator matches well-known results.
"
1044,Accelerating Deep Learning with Memcomputing,"  Restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) and their extensions, called
'deep-belief networks', are powerful neural networks that have found
applications in the fields of machine learning and artificial intelligence. The
standard way to training these models resorts to an iterative unsupervised
procedure based on Gibbs sampling, called 'contrastive divergence' (CD), and
additional supervised tuning via back-propagation. However, this procedure has
been shown not to follow any gradient and can lead to suboptimal solutions. In
this paper, we show an efficient alternative to CD by means of simulations of
digital memcomputing machines (DMMs). We test our approach on pattern
recognition using a modified version of the MNIST data set. DMMs sample
effectively the vast phase space given by the model distribution of the RBM,
and provide a very good approximation close to the optimum. This efficient
search significantly reduces the number of pretraining iterations necessary to
achieve a given level of accuracy, as well as a total performance gain over CD.
In fact, the acceleration of pretraining achieved by simulating DMMs is
comparable to, in number of iterations, the recently reported hardware
application of the quantum annealing method on the same network and data set.
Notably, however, DMMs perform far better than the reported quantum annealing
results in terms of quality of the training. We also compare our method to
advances in supervised training, like batch-normalization and rectifiers, that
work to reduce the advantage of pretraining. We find that the memcomputing
method still maintains a quality advantage ($>1\%$ in accuracy, and a $20\%$
reduction in error rate) over these approaches. Furthermore, our method is
agnostic about the connectivity of the network. Therefore, it can be extended
to train full Boltzmann machines, and even deep networks at once.
"
1045,"Charge-based superconducting digital logic family using quantum
  phase-slip junctions","  Superconducting digital computing systems, primarily involving Josephson
junctions are actively being pursued as high performance and low energy
dissipating alternatives to CMOS-based technologies for petascale and exascale
computers, although several challenges still exist in overcoming barriers to
practically implement these technologies. In this paper, we present an
alternative superconducting logic structure: quantized charge-based logic
circuits using quantum phase-slip junctions, which have been identified as dual
devices to Josephson junctions. Basic principles of logic implementation using
quantum phase-slips are presented in simulations with the help of a SPICE model
that has been developed for the quantum phase-slip structures. Circuit elements
that form the building blocks for complex logic circuit design are introduced.
Two different logic gate designs: OR gate and XOR gate are presented to
demonstrate the usage of the building blocks introduced.
"
1046,"Bridging the Gap Between Neural Networks and Neuromorphic Hardware with
  A Neural Network Compiler","  Different from developing neural networks (NNs) for general-purpose
processors, the development for NN chips usually faces with some
hardware-specific restrictions, such as limited precision of network signals
and parameters, constrained computation scale, and limited types of non-linear
functions.
  This paper proposes a general methodology to address the challenges. We
decouple the NN applications from the target hardware by introducing a compiler
that can transform an existing trained, unrestricted NN into an equivalent
network that meets the given hardware's constraints. We propose multiple
techniques to make the transformation adaptable to different kinds of NN chips,
and reliable for restrict hardware constraints.
  We have built such a software tool that supports both spiking neural networks
(SNNs) and traditional artificial neural networks (ANNs). We have demonstrated
its effectiveness with a fabricated neuromorphic chip and a
processing-in-memory (PIM) design. Tests show that the inference error caused
by this solution is insignificant and the transformation time is much shorter
than the retraining time. Also, we have studied the parameter-sensitivity
evaluations to explore the tradeoffs between network error and resource
utilization for different transformation strategies, which could provide
insights for co-design optimization of neuromorphic hardware and software.
"
1047,High Performance Quantum Modular Multipliers,"  We present a novel set of reversible modular multipliers applicable to
quantum computing, derived from three classical techniques: 1) traditional
integer division, 2) Montgomery residue arithmetic, and 3) Barrett reduction.
Each multiplier computes an exact result for all binary input values, while
maintaining the asymptotic resource complexity of a single (non-modular)
integer multiplier. We additionally conduct an empirical resource analysis of
our designs in order to determine the total gate count and circuit depth of
each fully constructed circuit, with inputs as large as 2048 bits. Our
comparative analysis considers both circuit implementations which allow for
arbitrary (controlled) rotation gates, as well as those restricted to a typical
fault-tolerant gate set.
"
1048,Design Exploration of Hybrid CMOS-OxRAM Deep Generative Architectures,"  Deep Learning and its applications have gained tremendous interest recently
in both academia and industry. Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) offer a key
methodology to implement deep learning paradigms. This paper presents a novel
approach for realizing hybrid CMOS-OxRAM based deep generative models (DGM). In
our proposed hybrid DGM architectures, HfOx based (filamentary-type switching)
OxRAM devices are extensively used for realizing multiple computational and
non-computational functions such as: (i) Synapses (weights), (ii) internal
neuron-state storage, (iii) stochastic neuron activation and (iv) programmable
signal normalization. To validate the proposed scheme we have simulated two
different architectures: (i) Deep Belief Network (DBN) and (ii) Stacked
Denoising Autoencoder for classification and reconstruction of hand-written
digits from a reduced MNIST dataset of 6000 images. Contrastive-divergence (CD)
specially optimized for OxRAM devices was used to drive the synaptic weight
update mechanism of each layer in the network. Overall learning rule was based
on greedy-layer wise learning with no back propagation which allows the network
to be trained to a good pre-training stage. Performance of the simulated hybrid
CMOS-RRAM DGM model matches closely with software based model for a 2-layers
deep network. Top-3 test accuracy achieved by the DBN was 95.5%. MSE of the SDA
network was 0.003, lower than software based approach. Endurance analysis of
the simulated architectures show that for 200 epochs of training (single RBM
layer), maximum switching events/per OxRAM device was ~ 7000 cycles.
"
1049,Spiking memristor logic gates are a type of time-variant perceptron,"  Memristors are low-power memory-holding resistors thought to be useful for
neuromophic computing, which can compute via spike-interactions mediated
through the device's short-term memory. Using interacting spikes, it is
possible to build an AND gate that computes OR at the same time, similarly a
full adder can be built that computes the arithmetical sum of its inputs. Here
we show how these gates can be understood by modelling the memristors as a
novel type of perceptron: one which is sensitive to input order. The
memristor's memory can change the input weights for later inputs, and thus the
memristor gates cannot be accurately described by a single perceptron,
requiring either a network of time-invarient perceptrons or a complex
time-varying self-reprogrammable perceptron. This work demonstrates the high
functionality of memristor logic gates, and also that the addition of
theasholding could enable the creation of a standard perceptron in hardware,
which may have use in building neural net chips.

1050,"Dendritic-Inspired Processing Enables Bio-Plausible STDP in Compound
  Binary Synapses","  Brain-inspired learning mechanisms, e.g. spike timing dependent plasticity
(STDP), enable agile and fast on-the-fly adaptation capability in a spiking
neural network. When incorporating emerging nanoscale resistive non-volatile
memory (NVM) devices, with ultra-low power consumption and high-density
integration capability, a spiking neural network hardware would result in
several orders of magnitude reduction in energy consumption at a very small
form factor and potentially herald autonomous learning machines. However,
actual memory devices have shown to be intrinsically binary with stochastic
switching, and thus impede the realization of ideal STDP with continuous analog
values. In this work, a dendritic-inspired processing architecture is proposed
in addition to novel CMOS neuron circuits. The utilization of spike
attenuations and delays transforms the traditionally undesired stochastic
behavior of binary NVMs into a useful leverage that enables
biologically-plausible STDP learning. As a result, this work paves a pathway to
adopt practical binary emerging NVM devices in brain-inspired neuromorphic
computing.
"
1051,Mechanical Computing Systems Using Only Links and Rotary Joints,"  A new model for mechanical computing is demonstrated that requires only two
basic parts: links and rotary joints. These basic parts are combined into two
main higher level structures: locks and balances, which suffice to create all
necessary combinatorial and sequential logic required for a Turing-complete
computational system. While working systems have yet to be implemented using
this new approach, the mechanical simplicity of the systems described may lend
themselves better to, e.g., microfabrication, than previous mechanical
computing designs. Additionally, simulations indicate that if molecular-scale
implementations could be realized, they would be far more energy-efficient than
conventional electronic computers.
"
1052,"Computing and Communications for the Software-Defined Metamaterial
  Paradigm: A Context Analysis","  Metamaterials are artificial structures which have recently enabled the
realization of novel electromagnetic components with engineered and even
unnatural functionalities. Existing metamaterials are specifically designed for
a single application working under preset conditions (e.g. electromagnetic
cloaking for a fixed angle of incidence) and cannot be reused. Software-Defined
Metamaterials (SDMs) are a much sought-after paradigm shift, exhibiting
electromagnetic properties that can be reconfigured at runtime using a set of
software primitives. To enable this new technology, SDMs require the
integration of a network of controllers within the structure of the
metamaterial, where each controller interacts locally and communicates globally
to obtain the programmed behavior. The design approach for such controllers and
the interconnection network, however, remains unclear due to the unique
combination of constraints and requirements of the scenario. To bridge this
gap, this paper aims to provide a context analysis from the computation and
communication perspectives. Then, analogies are drawn between the SDM scenario
and other applications both at the micro and nano scales, identifying possible
candidates for the implementation of the controllers and the intra-SDM network.
Finally, the main challenges of SDMs related to computing and communications
are outlined.

1053,Graphene-Based terahertz antennas for area-constrained applications,"  Terahertz technology has made significant advances in the fields of
spectroscopy, imaging and, more recently, wireless communications. In the
latter, the use of this frequency band between 0.1 and 10 THz becomes extremely
attractive due to the abundance of bandwidth and the potential for low area and
power footprints, yet challenging given the large propagation losses and the
lack of mature devices and circuits for terahertz operation. Maturity issues
aside, this combination of features renders terahertz wireless communications
desirable for highly integrated applications where area may be a decisive
metric.
"
1054,"A Software-defined SoC Memory Bus Bridge Architecture for Disaggregated
  Computing","  Disaggregation and rack-scale systems have the potential of drastically
decreasing TCO and increasing utilization of cloud datacenters, while
maintaining performance. While the concept of organising resources in separate
pools and interconnecting them together on demand is straightforward, its
materialisation can be radically different in terms of performance and scale
potential.
  In this paper, we present a memory bus bridge architecture which enables
communication between 100s of masters and slaves in todays complex
multiprocessor SoCs, that are physically intregrated in different chips and
even different mainboards. The bridge tightly couples serial transceivers and a
circuit network for chip-to-chip transfers. A key property of the proposed
bridge architecture is that it is software-defined and thus can be configured
at runtime, via a software control plane, to prepare and steer memory access
transactions to remote slaves. This is particularly important because it
enables datacenter orchestration tools to manage the disaggregated resource
allocation. Moreover, we evaluate a bridge prototype we have build for ARM AXI4
memory bus interconnect and we discuss application-level observed performance.
"
1055,"Terahertz Dielectric Resonator Antenna Coupled to Graphene Plasmonic
  Dipole","  This paper presents an efficient approach for exciting a dielectric resonator
antenna (DRA) in the terahertz frequencies by means of a graphene plasmonic
dipole. Design and analysis are performed in two steps. First, the propagation
properties of hybrid plasmonic onedimensional and two-dimensional structures
are obtained by using transfer matrix theory and the finite-element method. The
coupling amount between the plasmonic graphene mode and the dielectric wave
mode is explored based on different parameters. These results, together with
DRA and plasmonic antenna theory, are then used to design a DRA antenna that
supports the $TE_{y}^{112}$ mode at 2.4 THz and achieves a gain (IEEE) of up to
7 dBi and a radiation efficiency of up 70%. This gain is 6.5 dB higher than
that of the graphene dipole alone and achieved with a moderate area overhead,
demonstrating the value of the proposed structure.
"
1056,"MAC-Oriented Programmable Terahertz PHY via Graphene-based Yagi-Uda
  Antennas","  Graphene is enabling a plethora of applications in a wide range of fields due
to its unique electrical, mechanical, and optical properties. In the realm of
wireless communications, graphene shows great promise for the implementation of
miniaturized and tunable antennas in the terahertz band. These unique
advantages open the door to new reconfigurable antenna structures which, in
turn, enable novel communication protocols at different levels of the stack.
This paper explores both aspects by, first, presenting a terahertz
Yagi-Uda-like antenna concept that achieves reconfiguration both in frequency
and beam direction simultaneously. Then, a programmable antenna controller
design is proposed to expose the reconfigurability to the PHY and MAC layers,
and several examples of its applicability are given. The performance and cost
of the proposed scheme is evaluated through full-wave simulations and
comparative analysis, demonstrating reconfigurability at nanosecond granularity
with overheads below 0.02 mm$^{2}$ and 0.2 mW.
"
1057,"Full Wafer Redistribution and Wafer Embedding as Key Technologies for a
  Multi-Scale Neuromorphic Hardware Cluster","  Together with the Kirchhoff-Institute for Physics(KIP) the Fraunhofer IZM has
developed a full wafer redistribution and embedding technology as base for a
large-scale neuromorphic hardware system. The paper will give an overview of
the neuromorphic computing platform at the KIP and the associated hardware
requirements which drove the described technological developments. In the first
phase of the project standard redistribution technologies from wafer level
packaging were adapted to enable a high density reticle-to-reticle routing on
200mm CMOS wafers. Neighboring reticles were interconnected across the scribe
lines with an 8{\mu}m pitch routing based on semi-additive copper
metallization. Passivation by photo sensitive benzocyclobutene was used to
enable a second intra-reticle routing layer. Final IO pads with flash gold were
generated on top of each reticle. With that concept neuromorphic systems based
on full wafers could be assembled and tested. The fabricated high density
inter-reticle routing revealed a very high yield of larger than 99.9%. In order
to allow an upscaling of the system size to a large number of wafers with
feasible effort a full wafer embedding concept for printed circuit boards was
developed and proven in the second phase of the project. The wafers were
thinned to 250{\mu}m and laminated with additional prepreg layers and copper
foils into a core material. After lamination of the PCB panel the reticle IOs
of the embedded wafer were accessed by micro via drilling, copper
electroplating, lithography and subtractive etching of the PCB wiring
structure. The created wiring with 50um line width enabled an access of the
reticle IOs on the embedded wafer as well as a board level routing. The panels
with the embedded wafers were subsequently stressed with up to 1000 thermal
cycles between 0C and 100C and have shown no severe failure formation over the
cycle time.

1058,"DNA Molecular Storage System: Transferring Digitally Encoded Information
  through Bacterial Nanonetworks","  Since the birth of computer and networks, fuelled by pervasive computing and
ubiquitous connectivity, the amount of data stored and transmitted has
exponentially grown through the years. Due to this demand, new solutions for
storing data are needed, and one promising media is the DNA. This storage
solution provides numerous advantages, which includes the ability to store
dense information while achieving long-term stability. However, the question as
how the data can be retrieved from a DNA-based archive, still remains. In this
paper, we aim to address this question by proposing a new storage solution that
relies upon molecular communication, and in particular bacterial nanonetworks.
Our solution allows digitally encoded information to be stored into non-motile
bacteria, which compose an archival architecture of clusters, and to be later
retrieved by engineered motile bacteria, whenever reading operations are
needed. We conducted extensive simulations, in order to determine the
reliability of data retrieval from non-motile storage clusters, placed at
different locations. Aiming to assess the feasibility of our solution, we have
also conducted wet lab experiments that show how bacteria nanonetworks can
effectively retrieve a simple message, such as ""Hello World"", by conjugation
with non-motile bacteria, and finally mobilize towards a final point.

function will be presented in this paper. It is applied to samples returned
from the D-Wave for various example cases. This method, multi-qubit correction
(MQC), creates a sample with an equal-to or less-than energy than any of the
D-wave samples used to create it. The method will be detailed and the results
of 3 uses cases will be given to demonstrate its merit.

1060,A Novel Protocol for Network-Controlled Metasurfaces,"  A recently proposed class of materials, called software-defined
metamaterials, can change their electromagnetic behavior on demand, utilizing a
nanonetwork embedded in their structure. The present work focuses on 2D
metamaterials, known as metasurfaces, and their electromagnetically
programmable counterparts, the HyperSurfaces. The particular focus of the study
is to propose a nanonetworking protocol that can support the intended
macroscopic functionality of a HyperSurface, such as sensing and reacting to
impinging waves in a customizable manner. The novel protocol is derived
analytically, using the Lyapunov drift minimization approach, taking into
account nano-node energy, communication latency and complexity concerns. The
proposed scheme is evaluated via simulations, covering both the macroscopic
HyperSurface functionality and the microscopic, nanonetwork behavior.
"
1061,In-memory computing on a photonic platform,"  Collocated data processing and storage are the norm in biological systems.
Indeed, the von Neumann computing architecture, that physically and temporally
separates processing and memory, was born more of pragmatism based on available
technology. As our ability to create better hardware improves, new
computational paradigms are being explored. Integrated photonic circuits are
regarded as an attractive solution for on-chip computing using only light,
leveraging the increased speed and bandwidth potential of working in the
optical domain, and importantly, removing the need for time and energy sapping
electro-optical conversions. Here we show that we can combine the emerging area
of integrated optics with collocated data storage and processing to enable
all-photonic in-memory computations. By employing non-volatile photonic
elements based on the phase-change material, Ge2Sb2Te5, we are able to achieve
direct scalar multiplication on single devices. Featuring a novel single-shot
Write/Erase and a drift-free process, such elements can multiply two scalar
numbers by mapping their values to the energy of an input pulse and to the
transmittance of the device, codified in the crystallographic state of the
element. The output pulse, carrying the information of the light-matter
interaction, is the result of the computation. Our all-optical approach is
novel, easy to fabricate and operate, and sets the stage for development of
entirely photonic computers.
"
1062,Received Signal Strength for Randomly Distributed Molecular Nanonodes,"  We consider nanonodes randomly distributed in a circular area and
characterize the received signal strength when a pair of these nodes employ
molecular communication. Two communication methods are investigated, namely
free diffusion and diffusion with drift. Since the nodes are randomly
distributed, the distance between them can be represented as a random variable,
which results in a stochastic process representation of the received signal
strength. We derive the probability density function of this process for both
molecular communication methods. Specifically for the case of free diffusion we
also derive the cumulative distribution function, which can be used to derive
transmission success probabilities. The presented work constitutes a first step
towards the characterization of the signal to noise ratio in the considered
setting for a number of molecular communication methods.
"
1063,Voltage-driven Building Block for Hardware Belief Networks,"  Probabilistic spin logic (PSL), based on networks of binary stochastic
neurons (or p-bits), has been shown to provide a viable framework for many
functionalities including Ising computing, Bayesian inference, invertible
Boolean logic and image recognition. This paper presents a hardware building
block for the PSL architecture, consisting of an embedded MTJ and a capacitive
voltage adder of the type used in neuMOS. We use SPICE simulations to show how
identical copies of these building blocks (or weighted p-bits) can be
interconnected with wires to design and solve a small instance of the
NP-complete Subset Sum Problem fully in hardware.

1064,A QCA Layout Design Methodology. Part I,"  Quantum-dot Cellular Automata (QCA) as a nanoscale transistor-less device
technology offers distinguishing advantages over the limitations of CMOS
circuits. While more than 2 decades of design progress have been achieved with
QCA, a comprehensive composition approach for the layout design in this
technology is needed. In this study, the Priority-Phased Decomposition-Driven
(PPDD) QCA logic design methodology is proposed. In this methodology, after
partitioning combinational and sequential circuits into primary-level priority
blocks including 2:1 MUX and XOR gates, and secondary-level priority blocks
comprising multi-input majority gates, there are three streamlined approaches
which are developed to compose the desired QCA circuit using blocks from each
priority level.

1065,"Energy-efficient Deployment of Relay Nodes in Wireless Sensor Networks
  using Evolutionary Techniques","  Random deployment of sensor nodes is susceptible to initial communication
hole, even when the network is densely populated. However, eliminating holes
using structural deployment poses its difficulties. In either case, the
resulting coverage holes can degrade overall network performance and lifetime.
Many solutions utilizing Relay Nodes (RNs) have been proposed to alleviate this
problem. In this regard, one of the recent solutions proposed using Artificial
Bee Colony (ABC) to deploy RNs. This paper proposes RN deployment using two
other evolutionary techniques - Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA) and
Differential Evolution (DE) and compares them with existing solution that uses
ABC. These popular optimization tools are deployed to optimize the positions of
relay nodes for lifetime maximization. Proposed algorithms guarantee
satisfactory RNs utilization while maintaining desired connectivity level. It
is shown that DE-based deployment improves the network lifetime better than
other optimization heuristics considered.

1067,Leveraging Adiabatic Quantum Computation for Election Forecasting,"  Accurate, reliable sampling from fully-connected graphs with arbitrary
correlations is a difficult problem. Such sampling requires knowledge of the
probabilities of observing every possible state of a graph. As graph size
grows, the number of model states becomes intractably large and efficient
computation requires full sampling be replaced with heuristics and algorithms
that are only approximations of full sampling. This work investigates the
potential impact of adiabatic quantum computation for sampling purposes,
building on recent successes training Boltzmann machines using a quantum
device. We investigate the use case of quantum computation to train Boltzmann
machines for predicting the 2016 Presidential election.

1068,"Algorithm-Hardware Co-Optimization of the Memristor-Based Framework for
  Solving SOCP and Homogeneous QCQP Problems","  A memristor crossbar, which is constructed with memristor devices, has the
unique ability to change and memorize the state of each of its memristor
elements. It also has other highly desirable features such as high density, low
power operation and excellent scalability. Hence the memristor crossbar
technology can potentially be utilized for developing low-complexity and
high-scalability solution frameworks for solving a large class of convex
optimization problems, which involve extensive matrix operations and have
critical applications in multiple disciplines. This paper, as the first attempt
towards this direction, proposes a novel memristor crossbar-based framework for
solving two important convex optimization problems, i.e., second-order cone
programming (SOCP) and homogeneous quadratically constrained quadratic
programming (QCQP) problems. In this paper, the alternating direction method of
multipliers (ADMM) is adopted. It splits the SOCP and homogeneous QCQP problems
into sub-problems that involve the solution of linear systems, which could be
effectively solved using the memristor crossbar in O(1) time complexity. The
proposed algorithm is an iterative procedure that iterates a constant number of
times. Therefore, algorithms to solve SOCP and homogeneous QCQP problems have
pseudo-O(N) complexity, which is a significant reduction compared to the
state-of-the-art software solvers (O(N^3.5) - O(N^4)).
"
1069,"Channel Model of Molecular Communication via Diffusion in a Vessel-like
  Environment Considering a Partially Covering Receiver","  By considering potential health problems that a fully covering receiver may
cause in vessel-like environments, the implementation of a partially covering
receiver is needed. To this end, distribution of hitting location of messenger
molecules (MM) is analyzed within the context of molecular communication via
diffusion with the aim of channel modeling. The distribution of these MMs for a
fully covering receiver is analyzed in two parts: angular and radial
dimensions. For the angular distribution analysis, the receiver is divided into
180 slices to analyze the mean, standard deviation, and coefficient of
variation of these slices. For the axial distance distribution analysis,
Kolmogorov- Smirnov test is applied for different significance levels. Also,
two different implementations of the reflection from the vessel surface (i.e.,
rollback and elastic reflection) are compared and mathematical representation
of elastic reflection is given. The results show that MMs have tendency to
spread uniformly beyond a certain ratio of the distance to the vessel radius.
By utilizing the uniformity, we propose a channel model for the partially
covering receiver in vessel-like environments and validate the proposed model
by simulations.

"
1071,Thermodynamically Favorable Computation via Tile Self-assembly,"  The recently introduced Thermodynamic Binding Networks (TBN) model was
developed with the purpose of studying self-assembling systems by focusing on
their thermodynamically favorable final states, and ignoring the kinetic
pathways through which they evolve. The model was intentionally developed to
abstract away not only the notion of time, but also the constraints of
geometry. Collections of monomers with binding domains which allow them to form
polymers via complementary bonds are analyzed to determine their final, stable
configurations, which are those which maximize the number of bonds formed (i.e.
enthalpy) and the number of independent components (i.e. entropy). In this
paper, we first develop a definition of what it means for a TBN to perform a
computation, and then present a set of constructions which are capable of
performing computations by simulating the behaviors of space-bounded Turing
machines and boolean circuits. In contrast to previous TBN results, these
constructions are robust to great variability in the counts of monomers
existing in the systems and the numbers of polymers that form in parallel.
Although the Turing machine simulating TBNs are inefficient in terms of the
numbers of unique monomer types required, as compared to algorithmic
self-assembling systems in the abstract Tile Assembly Model (aTAM), we then
show that a general strategy of porting those aTAM system designs to TBNs
produces TBNs which incorrectly simulate computations. Finally, we present a
refinement of the TBN model which we call the Geometric Thermodynamic Binding
Networks (GTBN) model in which monomers are defined with rigid geometries and
form rigid bonds. Utilizing the constraints imposed by geometry, we then
provide a GTBN construction capable of simulating Turing machines as
efficiently as in the aTAM.

1072,"Exploiting Spin-Orbit Torque Devices as Reconfigurable Logic for Circuit
  Obfuscation","  Circuit obfuscation is a frequently used approach to conceal logic
functionalities in order to prevent reverse engineering attacks on fabricated
chips. Efficient obfuscation implementations are expected with lower design
complexity and overhead but higher attack difficulties. In this paper, an
emerging obfuscation approach is proposed by leveraging spinorbit torque (SOT)
devices based look-up-tables (LUTs) as reconfigurable logic to replace the
carefully selected gates. It is essentially impossible to identify the
obfuscated gate with SOTs inside according to the physical geometry
characteristics because the configured functionalities are represented by
magnetization states. Such an obfuscation approach makes the circuit security
further improved with high exponential attack complexities. Experiments on MCNC
and ISCAS 85/89 benchmark suits show that the proposed approach could reduce
the area overheads due to obfuscation by 10% averagely.

1074,A first look at the usability of bitcoin key management,"  Bitcoin users are directly or indirectly forced to deal with public key
cryptography, which has a number of security and usability challenges that
differ from the password-based authentication underlying most online banking
services. Users must ensure that keys are simultaneously accessible, resistant
to digital theft and resilient to loss. In this paper, we contribute an
evaluation framework for comparing Bitcoin key management approaches, and
conduct a broad usability evaluation of six representative Bitcoin clients. We
find that Bitcoin shares many of the fundamental challenges of key management
known from other domains, but that Bitcoin may present a unique opportunity to
rethink key management for end users.

1075,"DataBright: Towards a Global Exchange for Decentralized Data Ownership
  and Trusted Computation","  It is safe to assume that, for the foreseeable future, machine learning,
especially deep learning will remain both data- and computation-hungry. In this
paper, we ask: Can we build a global exchange where everyone can contribute
computation and data to train the next generation of machine learning
applications?
  We present an early, but running prototype of DataBright, a system that turns
the creation of training examples and the sharing of computation into an
investment mechanism. Unlike most crowdsourcing platforms, where the
contributor gets paid when they submit their data, DataBright pays dividends
whenever a contributor's data or hardware is used by someone to train a machine
learning model. The contributor becomes a shareholder in the dataset they
created. To enable the measurement of usage, a computation platform that
contributors can trust is also necessary. DataBright thus merges both a data
market and a trusted computation market.
  We illustrate that trusted computation can enable the creation of an AI
market, where each data point has an exact value that should be paid to its
creator. DataBright allows data creators to retain ownership of their
contribution and attaches to it a measurable value. The value of the data is
given by its utility in subsequent distributed computation done on the
DataBright computation market. The computation market allocates tasks and
subsequent payments to pooled hardware. This leads to the creation of a
decentralized AI cloud. Our experiments show that trusted hardware such as
Intel SGX can be added to the usual ML pipeline with no additional costs. We
use this setting to orchestrate distributed computation that enables the
creation of a computation market. DataBright is available for download at

1076,On the Feasibility of Decentralized Derivatives Markets,"  In this paper, we present Velocity, a decentralized market deployed on
Ethereum for trading a custom type of derivative option. To enable the smart
contract to work, we also implement a price fetching tool called PriceGeth. We
present this as a case study, noting challenges in development of the system
that might be of independent interest to whose working on smart contract
implementations. We also apply recent academic results on the security of the
Solidity smart contract language in validating our codes security. Finally, we
discuss more generally the use of smart contracts in modelling financial
derivatives.
"
1077,Internet Location Verification: Challenges and Solutions,"  This thesis addresses the problem of verifying the geographic locations of
Internet clients. First, we demonstrate how current state-of-the-art
delay-based geolocation techniques are susceptible to evasion through delay
manipulations, which involve both increasing and decreasing the Internet delays
that are observed between a client and a remote measuring party. We then
propose Client Presence Verification (CPV) as a delay-based technique to verify
an assertion about a client's physical presence in a prescribed geographic
region. Three verifiers geographically encapsulating a client's asserted
location are used to corroborate that assertion by measuring the delays between
themselves and the client. CPV infers geographic distances from these delays
and thus, using the smaller of the forward and reverse one-way delay between
each verifier and the client is expected to result in a more accurate distance
inference than using the conventional round-trip times. Accordingly, we devise
a novel protocol for accurate one-way delay measurements between the client and
the three verifiers to be used by CPV, taking into account that the client
could manipulate the measurements to defeat the verification process. We
evaluate CPV through extensive real-world experiments with legitimate clients
(those truly present at where they asserted to be) modeled to use both wired
and wireless access networks. Wired evaluation is done using the PlanetLab
testbed, during which we examine various factors affecting CPV's efficacy, such
as the client's geographical nearness to the verifiers. For wireless
evaluation, we leverage the Internet delay information collected for wired
clients from PlanetLab, and model additional delays representing the last-mile
wireless link. Finally, we reinforce CPV against a (hypothetical) middlebox
that an adversary specifically customizes to defeat CPV.
"
1078,Molecular Computing for Markov Chains,"  In this paper, it is presented a methodology for implementing arbitrarily
constructed time-homogenous Markov chains with biochemical systems. Not only
discrete but also continuous-time Markov chains are allowed to be computed. By
employing chemical reaction networks (CRNs) as a programmable language,
molecular concentrations serve to denote both input and output values. One
reaction network is elaborately designed for each chain. The evolution of
species' concentrations over time well matches the transient solutions of the
target continuous-time Markov chain, while equilibrium concentrations can
indicate the steady state probabilities. Additionally, second-order Markov
chains are considered for implementation, with bimolecular reactions rather
that unary ones. An original scheme is put forward to compile unimolecular
systems to DNA strand displacement reactions for the sake of future physical
implementations. Deterministic, stochastic and DNA simulations are provided to
enhance correctness, validity and feasibility.

1079,"Enabling Interactive Mobile Simulations Through Distributed Reduced
  Models","  Currently, various hardware and software companies are developing augmented
reality devices, most prominently Microsoft with its Hololens. Besides gaming,
such devices can be used for serious pervasive applications, like interactive
mobile simulations to support engineers in the field. Interactive simulations
have high demands on resources, which the mobile device alone is unable to
satisfy. Therefore, we propose a framework to support mobile simulations by
distributing the computation between the mobile device and a remote server
based on the reduced basis method. Evaluations show that we can speed-up the
numerical computation by over 131 times while using 73 times less energy.
"
1080,Memcomputing: Leveraging memory and physics to compute efficiently,"  It is well known that physical phenomena may be of great help in computing
some difficult problems efficiently. A typical example is prime factorization
that may be solved in polynomial time by exploiting quantum entanglement on a
quantum computer. There are, however, other types of (non-quantum) physical
properties that one may leverage to compute efficiently a wide range of hard
problems. In this perspective we discuss how to employ one such property,
memory (time non-locality), in a novel physics-based approach to computation:
Memcomputing. In particular, we focus on digital memcomputing machines (DMMs)
that are scalable. DMMs can be realized with non-linear dynamical systems with
memory. The latter property allows the realization of a new type of Boolean
logic, one that is self-organizing. Self-organizing logic gates are
""terminal-agnostic"", namely they do not distinguish between input and output
terminals. When appropriately assembled to represent a given
combinatorial/optimization problem, the corresponding self-organizing circuit
converges to the equilibrium points that express the solutions of the problem
at hand. In doing so, DMMs take advantage of the long-range order that develops
during the transient dynamics. This collective dynamical behavior, reminiscent
of a phase transition, or even the ""edge of chaos"", is mediated by families of
classical trajectories (instantons) that connect critical points of increasing
stability in the system's phase space. The topological character of the
solution search renders DMMs robust against noise and structural disorder.
Since DMMs are non-quantum systems described by ordinary differential
equations, not only can they be built in hardware with available technology,
they can also be simulated efficiently on modern classical computers. As an
example, we will show the polynomial-time solution of the subset-sum problem
for the worst...

1081,"8T SRAM Cell as a Multi-bit Dot Product Engine for Beyond von-Neumann
  Computing","  Large scale digital computing almost exclusively relies on the von-Neumann
architecture which comprises of separate units for storage and computations.
The energy expensive transfer of data from the memory units to the computing
cores results in the well-known von-Neumann bottleneck. Various approaches
aimed towards bypassing the von-Neumann bottleneck are being extensively
explored in the literature. Emerging non-volatile memristive technologies have
been shown to be very efficient in computing analog dot products in an in-situ
fashion. The memristive analog computation of the dot product results in much
faster operation as opposed to digital vector in-memory bit-wise Boolean
computations. However, challenges with respect to large scale manufacturing
coupled with the limited endurance of memristors have hindered rapid
commercialization of memristive based computing solutions. In this work, we
show that the standard 8 transistor (8T) digital SRAM array can be configured
as an analog-like in-memory multi-bit dot product engine. By applying
appropriate analog voltages to the read-ports of the 8T SRAM array, and sensing
the output current, an approximate analog-digital dot-product engine can be
implemented. We present two different configurations for enabling multi-bit dot
product computations in the 8T SRAM cell array, without modifying the standard
bit-cell structure. Since our proposal preserves the standard 8T-SRAM array
structure, it can be used as a storage element with standard read-write
instructions, and also as an on-demand analog-like dot product accelerator.

1082,"Enabling Multiple Access for Non-Line-of-Sight Light-to-Camera
  Communications","  Light-to-Camera Communications (LCC) have emerged as a new wireless
communication technology with great potential to benefit a broad range of
applications. However, the existing LCC systems either require cameras directly
facing to the lights or can only communicate over a single link, resulting in
low throughputs and being fragile to ambient illuminant interference. We
present HYCACO, a novel LCC system, which enables multiple light emitting
diodes (LEDs) with an unaltered camera to communicate via the non-line-of-sight
(NLoS) links. Different from other NLoS LCC systems, the proposed scheme is
resilient to the complex indoor luminous environment. HYCACO can decode the
messages by exploring the mixed reflected optical signals transmitted from
multiple LEDs. By further exploiting the rolling shutter mechanism, we present
the optimal optical frequencies and camera exposure duration selection strategy
to achieve the best performance. We built a hardware prototype to demonstrate
the efficiency of the proposed scheme under different application scenarios.
The experimental results show that the system throughput reaches 4.5 kbps on
iPhone 6s with three transmitters. With the robustness, improved system
throughput and ease of use, HYCACO has great potentials to be used in a wide
range of applications such as advertising, tagging objects, and device
certifications.
"
1083,"Dual polarization nonlinear Fourier transform-based optical
  communication system","  New services and applications are causing an exponential increase in internet
traffic. In a few years, current fiber optic communication system
infrastructure will not be able to meet this demand because fiber nonlinearity
dramatically limits the information transmission rate. Eigenvalue communication
could potentially overcome these limitations. It relies on a mathematical
technique called ""nonlinear Fourier transform (NFT)"" to exploit the ""hidden""
linearity of the nonlinear Schr\""odinger equation as the master model for
signal propagation in an optical fiber. We present here the theoretical tools
describing the NFT for the Manakov system and report on experimental
transmission results for dual polarization in fiber optic eigenvalue
communications. A transmission of up to 373.5 km with bit error rate less than
the hard-decision forward error correction threshold has been achieved. Our
results demonstrate that dual-polarization NFT can work in practice and enable
an increased spectral efficiency in NFT-based communication systems, which are
currently based on single polarization channels.
"
1084,"Capacitively Driven Global Interconnect with Magnetoelectric Switching
  Based Receiver for Higher Energy Efficiency","  We propose capacitively driven low-swing global interconnect circuit using a
receiver that utilizes magnetoelectric (ME) effect induced magnetization
switching to reduce the energy consumption. Capacitively driven wire has
recently been shown to be effective in improving the performance of global
interconnects. Such techniques can reduce the signal swing in the interconnect
by using a capacitive divider network and does not require an additional
voltage supply. However, the large reduction in signal swing makes it necessary
to use differential signaling and amplification for successful regeneration at
the receiver, which add area and static power. ME effect induced magnetization
reversal has recently been proposed which shows the possibility of using a low
voltage to switch a nanomagnet adjacent to a multi-ferroic oxide. Here, we
propose an ME effect based receiver that uses the low voltage at the receiving
end of the global wire to switch a nanomagnet. The nanomagnet is also used as
the free layer of a magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ), the resistance of which is
tuned through the ME effect. This change in MTJ resistance is converted to full
swing binary signals by using simple digital components. This process allows
capacitive low swing interconnection without differential signaling or
amplification, which leads to significant energy efficiency. Our simulation
results indicate that for 5-10 mm long global wires in IBM 45 nm technology,
capacitive ME design consumes 3x lower energy compared to full-swing CMOS
design and 2x lower energy compared to differential amplifier based low-swing
capacitive CMOS design.
"
1085,"Q#: Enabling scalable quantum computing and development with a
  high-level domain-specific language","  Quantum computing exploits quantum phenomena such as superposition and
entanglement to realize a form of parallelism that is not available to
traditional computing. It offers the potential of significant computational
speed-ups in quantum chemistry, materials science, cryptography, and machine
learning. The dominant approach to programming quantum computers is to provide
an existing high-level language with libraries that allow for the expression of
quantum programs. This approach can permit computations that are meaningless in
a quantum context; prohibits succinct expression of interaction between
classical and quantum logic; and does not provide important constructs that are
required for quantum programming. We present Q#, a quantum-focused
domain-specific language explicitly designed to correctly, clearly and
completely express quantum algorithms. Q# provides a type system, a tightly
constrained environment to safely interleave classical and quantum
computations; specialized syntax, symbolic code manipulation to automatically
generate correct transformations of quantum operations, and powerful functional
constructs which aid composition.
"
1086,QWIRE Practice: Formal Verification of Quantum Circuits in Coq,"  We describe an embedding of the QWIRE quantum circuit language in the Coq
proof assistant. This allows programmers to write quantum circuits using
high-level abstractions and to prove properties of those circuits using Coq's
theorem proving features. The implementation uses higher-order abstract syntax
to represent variable binding and provides a type-checking algorithm for linear
wire types, ensuring that quantum circuits are well-formed. We formalize a
denotational semantics that interprets QWIRE circuits as superoperators on
density matrices, and prove the correctness of some simple quantum programs.
"
1087,Programming Quantum Computers Using Design Automation,"  Recent developments in quantum hardware indicate that systems featuring more
than 50 physical qubits are within reach. At this scale, classical simulation
will no longer be feasible and there is a possibility that such quantum devices
may outperform even classical supercomputers at certain tasks. With the rapid
growth of qubit numbers and coherence times comes the increasingly difficult
challenge of quantum program compilation. This entails the translation of a
high-level description of a quantum algorithm to hardware-specific low-level
operations which can be carried out by the quantum device. Some parts of the
calculation may still be performed manually due to the lack of efficient
methods. This, in turn, may lead to a design gap, which will prevent the
programming of a quantum computer. In this paper, we discuss the challenges in
fully-automatic quantum compilation. We motivate directions for future research
to tackle these challenges. Yet, with the algorithms and approaches that exist
today, we demonstrate how to automatically perform the quantum programming flow
from algorithm to a physical quantum computer for a simple algorithmic
benchmark, namely the hidden shift problem. We present and use two tool flows
which invoke RevKit. One which is based on ProjectQ and which targets the IBM
Quantum Experience or a local simulator, and one which is based on Microsoft's
quantum programming language Q$\#$.
"
1088,"Design of a Low Voltage Analog-to-Digital Converter using Voltage
  Controlled Stochastic Switching of Low Barrier Nanomagnets","  The inherent stochasticity in many nano-scale devices makes them prospective
candidates for low-power computations. Such devices have been demonstrated to
exhibit probabilistic switching between two stable states to achieve stochastic
behavior. Recently, superparamagnetic nanomagnets (having low energy barrier EB
$\sim$ 1kT) have shown promise of achieving stochastic switching at GHz rates,
with very low currents. On the other hand, voltage-controlled switching of
nanomagnets through the Magneto-electric (ME) effect has shown further
improvements in energy efficiency. In this simulation paper, we first analyze
the stochastic switching characteristics of such super-paramagnetic nanomagnets
in a voltage-controlled spintronic device. We study the influence of external
bias on the switching behavior. Subsequently, we show that our proposed device
leverages the voltage controlled stochasticity in performing low-voltage 8-bit
analog to digital conversions. This eliminates the need for comparators, unlike
the Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS)-based flash
Analog-to-Digital converters (ADC). This device allows for a simple and compact
design which can potentially be applied in implementing sensors which desire
low voltage conversions.
"
1089,Excitable London: Street map analysis with Oregonator model,"  We explore geometry of London's streets using computational mode of an
excitable chemical system, Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) medium. We virtually fill
in the streets with a BZ medium and study propagation of excitation waves for a
range of excitability parameters, gradual transition from excitable to
sub-excitable to non-excitable. We demonstrate a pruning strategy adopted by
the medium with decreasing excitability when wider and ballistically
appropriate streets are selected. We explain mechanics of streets selection and
pruning. The results of the paper will be used in future studies of studying
dynamics of cities with living excitable substrates.
"
1090,Back to the Future: The Case for Reversible Computing,"  There is one, and only one way, consistent with fundamental physics, that the
efficiency of general digital computation can continue increasing indefinitely,
and that is to apply the principles of reversible computing. We need to begin
intensive development work on this technology soon if we want to maintain
advances in computing and the attendant economic growth.
  NOTE: This paper is an extended author's preprint of the feature article
titled ""Throwing Computing Into Reverse"" (print) or ""The Future of Computing
Depends on Making it Reversible"" (online), published by IEEE Spectrum in

1091,A Characterization of the DNA Data Storage Channel,"  Owing to its longevity and enormous information density, DNA, the molecule
encoding biological information, has emerged as a promising archival storage
medium. However, due to technological constraints, data can only be written
onto many short DNA molecules that are stored in an unordered way, and can only
be read by sampling from this DNA pool. Moreover, imperfections in writing
(synthesis), reading (sequencing), storage, and handling of the DNA, in
particular amplification via PCR, lead to a loss of DNA molecules and induce
errors within the molecules. In order to design DNA storage systems, a
qualitative and quantitative understanding of the errors and the loss of
molecules is crucial. In this paper, we characterize those error probabilities
by analyzing data from our own experiments as well as from experiments of two
different groups. We find that errors within molecules are mainly due to
synthesis and sequencing, while imperfections in handling and storage lead to a
significant loss of sequences. The aim of our study is to help guide the design
of future DNA data storage systems by providing a quantitative and qualitative
understanding of the DNA data storage channel.
"
1092,Thermal Management in Fine-Grained 3-D Integrated Circuits,"  For beyond 2-D CMOS logic, various 3-D integration approaches specially
transistor based 3-D integrations such as monolithic 3-D [1], Skybridge [2],
SN3D [3] holds most promise. However, such 3D architectures within small form
factor increase hotspots and demand careful consideration of thermal management
at all levels of integration [4] as stacked transistors are detached from the
substrate (i.e., heat sink). Traditional system level approaches such as liquid
cooling [5], heat spreader [6], etc. are inadequate for transistor level 3-D
integration and have huge cost overhead [7]. In this paper, we investigate the
thermal profile for transistor level 3-D integration approaches through finite
element based modeling. Additionally, we propose generic physical level heat
management features for such transistor level 3-D integration and show their
application through detailed thermal modeling and simulations. These features
include a thermal junction and heat conducting nano pillar. The heat junction
is a specialized junction to extract heat from a selected region in 3-D; it
allows heat conduction without interference with the electrical activities of
the circuit. In conjunction with the junction, our proposed thermal pillars
enable heat dissipation through the substrate; these pillars are analogous to
TSVs/Vias, but carry only heat. Such structures are generic and is applicable
to any transistor level 3-D integration approaches. We perform 3-D finite
element based analysis to capture both static and transient thermal behaviors
of 3-D circuits, and show the effectiveness of heat management features. Our
simulation results show that without any heat extraction feature, temperature
for 3-D integrated circuits increased by almost 100K-200K. However, proposed
heat extraction feature is very effective in heat management, reducing
temperature from heated area by up to 53%.
"
1093,"A New Simulation Algorithm for Absorbing Receiver in Molecular
  Communication","  The simulation of diffusion-based molecular communication systems with
absorbing receivers often requires a high computational complexity to produce
accurate results. In this work, a new a priori Monte Carlo (APMC) algorithm is
proposed to precisely simulate the molecules absorbed at a spherical receiver
when the simulation time step length is relatively large. This algorithm
addresses the limitations of the current refined Monte Carlo (RMC) algorithm,
since the RMC algorithm provides accurate simulation only for a relatively
small time step length. The APMC algorithm is demonstrated to achieve a higher
simulation efficiency than the existing algorithms by finding that the APMC
algorithm, for a relatively large time step length, absorbs the fraction of
molecules expected by analysis, while other algorithms do not.
"
1094,"A case for multiple and parallel RRAMs as synaptic model for training
  SNNs","  To enable a dense integration of model synapses in a spiking neural networks
hardware, various nano-scale devices are being considered. Such a device,
besides exhibiting spike-time dependent plasticity (STDP), needs to be highly
scalable, have a large endurance and require low energy for transitioning
between states. In this work, we first introduce and empirically determine two
new specifications for an synapse in SNNs: number of conductance levels per
synapse and maximum learning-rate. To the best of our knowledge, there are no
RRAMs that meet the latter specification. As a solution, we propose the use of
multiple PCMO-RRAMs in parallel within a synapse. While synaptic reading, all
PCMO-RRAMs are simultaneously read and for each synaptic conductance-change
event, the mechanism for conductance STDP is initiated for only one RRAM,
randomly picked from the set. Second, to validate our solution, we
experimentally demonstrate STDP of conductance of a PCMO-RRAM and then show
that due to a large learning-rate, a single PCMO-RRAM fails to model a synapse
in the training of an SNN. As anticipated, network training improves as more
PCMO-RRAMs are added to the synapse. Fourth, we discuss the
circuit-requirements for implementing such a scheme, to conclude that the
requirements are within bounds. Thus, our work presents specifications for
synaptic devices in trainable SNNs, indicates the shortcomings of state-of-art
synaptic contenders, and provides a solution to extrinsically meet the
specifications and discusses the peripheral circuitry that implements the
solution.
"
1095,Approximate Quantum Fourier Transform with $O(n \log(n))$ T gates,"  The ability to implement the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) efficiently on a
quantum computer facilitates the advantages offered by a variety of fundamental
quantum algorithms, such as those for integer factoring, computing discrete
logarithm over Abelian groups, solving systems of linear equations, and phase
estimation, to name a few. The standard fault-tolerant implementation of an
$n$-qubit unitary QFT approximates the desired transformation by removing
small-angle controlled rotations and synthesizing the remaining ones into
Clifford+T gates, incurring the T-count complexity of $O(n \log^2(n))$. In this
paper, we show how to obtain approximate QFT with the T-count of $O(n
\log(n))$. Our approach relies on quantum circuits with measurements and
feedforward, and on reusing a special quantum state that induces the phase
gradient transformation. We report asymptotic analysis as well as concrete
circuits, demonstrating significant advantages in both theory and practice.
"
1096,"Feature extraction without learning in an analog Spatial Pooler
  memristive-CMOS circuit design of Hierarchical Temporal Memory","  Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) is a neuromorphic algorithm that emulates
sparsity, hierarchy and modularity resembling the working principles of
neocortex. Feature encoding is an important step to create sparse binary
patterns. This sparsity is introduced by the binary weights and random weight
assignment in the initialization stage of the HTM. We propose the alternative
deterministic method for the HTM initialization stage, which connects the HTM
weights to the input data and preserves natural sparsity of the input
information. Further, we introduce the hardware implementation of the
deterministic approach and compare it to the traditional HTM and existing
hardware implementation. We test the proposed approach on the face recognition
problem and show that it outperforms the conventional HTM approach.
"
1097,Neuron inspired data encoding memristive multi-level memory cell,"  Mapping neuro-inspired algorithms to sensor backplanes of on-chip hardware
require shifting the signal processing from digital to the analog domain,
demanding memory technologies beyond conventional CMOS binary storage units.
Using memristors for building analog data storage is one of the promising
approaches amongst emerging non-volatile memory technologies. Recently, a
memristive multi-level memory (MLM) cell for storing discrete analog values has
been developed in which memory system is implemented combining memristors in
voltage divider configuration. In given example, the memory cell of 3 sub-cells
with a memristor in each was programmed to store ternary bits which overall
achieved 10 and 27 discrete voltage levels. However, for further use of
proposed memory cell in analog signal processing circuits data encoder is
required to generate control voltages for programming memristors to store
discrete analog values. In this paper, we present the design and performance
analysis of data encoder that generates write pattern signals for 10 level
memristive memory.
"
1098,Logical Gates via Gliders Collisions,"  An elementary cellular automaton with memory is a chain of finite state
machines (cells) updating their state simultaneously and by the same rule. Each
cell updates its current state depending on current states of its immediate
neighbours and a certain number of its own past states. Some cell-state
transition rules support gliders, compact patterns of non-quiescent states
translating along the chain. We present designs of logical gates, including
reversible Fredkin gate and controlled NOT gate, implemented via collisions
between gliders.
"
1099,Using StackOverflow content to assist in code review,"  An important goal for programmers is to minimize cost of identifying and
correcting defects in source code. Code review is commonly used for identifying
programming defects. However, manual code review has some shortcomings: a) it
is time consuming, b) outcomes are subjective and depend on the skills of
reviewers. An automated approach for assisting in code reviews is thus highly
desirable. We present a tool for assisting in code review and results from our
experiments evaluating the tool in different scenarios. The tool leveraged
content available from professional programmer support forums (e.g.
StackOverflow.com) to determine potential defectiveness of a given piece of
source code. The defectiveness is expressed on the scale of {Likely defective,
Neutral, Unlikely to be defective}. Basic idea employed in the tool is to: a)
Identify a set P of discussion posts on StackOverflow such that each p in P
contains source code fragment(s) which sufficiently resemble the input code C
being reviewed. b) Determine the likelihood of C being defective by considering
all p in P . A novel aspect of our approach is to use document fingerprinting
for comparing two pieces of source code. Our choice of document fingerprinting
technique is inspired by source code plagiarism detection tools where it has
proven to be very successful. In the experiments that we performed to verify
effectiveness of our approach source code samples from more than 300 GitHub
open source repositories were taken as input. A precision of more than 90% in
identifying correct/relevant results has been achieved.
"
1100,"Analog simulator of integro-differential equations with classical
  memristors","  An analog computer makes use of continuously changeable quantities of a
system, such as its electrical, mechanical, or hydraulic properties, to solve a
given problem. While these devices are usually computationally more powerful
than their digital counterparts, they suffer from analog noise which does not
allow for error control. We will focus on analog computers based on active
electrical networks comprised of resistors, capacitors, and operational
amplifiers which are capable of simulating any linear ordinary differential
equation. However, the class of nonlinear dynamics they can solve is limited.
In this work, by adding memristors to the electrical network, we show that the
analog computer can simulate a large variety of linear and nonlinear
integro-differential equations by carefully choosing the conductance and the
dynamics of the memristor state variable. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first time that circuits based on memristors are proposed for simulations.
We study the performance of these analog computers by simulating
integro-differential models related to fluid dynamics, nonlinear Volterra
equations for population growth, and quantum models describing non-Markovian
memory effects, among others. Finally, we perform stability tests by
considering imperfect analog components, obtaining robust solutions with up to
$13\%$ relative error for relevant timescales.
"
1101,Comparative Study of Approximate Multipliers,"  Approximate multipliers are widely being advocated for energy-efficient
computing in applications that exhibit an inherent tolerance to inaccuracy.
However, the inclusion of accuracy as a key design parameter, besides the
performance, area and power, makes the identification of the most suitable
approximate multiplier quite challenging. In this paper, we identify three
major decision making factors for the selection of an approximate multipliers
circuit: (1) the type of approximate full adder (FA) used to construct the
multiplier, (2) the architecture, i.e., array or tree, of the multiplier and
(3) the placement of sub-modules of approximate and exact multipliers in the
main multiplier module. Based on these factors, we explored the design space
for circuit level implementations of approximate multipliers. We used circuit
level implementations of some of the most widely used approximate full adders,
i.e., approximate mirror adders, XOR/XNOR based approximate full adders and
Inexact adder cell. These FA cells are then used to develop circuits for the
approximate high order compressors as building blocks for 8x8 array and tree
multipliers. We then develop various implementations of higher bit multipliers
by using a combination of exact and inaccurate 8x8 multiplier cells. All these
implementations have been done using the Cadence's Spectre tool with the
TSMC65nm technology. The design space of these multipliers is explored based on
their power, area, delay and error and the best approximate multiplier designs
are identified. The report also presents the validation of our results using an
image blending application. An open source library of implemented cells and
multiplier circuits are available online.
"
1102,"Comparing and Integrating Constraint Programming and Temporal Planning
  for Quantum Circuit Compilation","  Recently, the makespan-minimization problem of compiling a general class of
quantum algorithms into near-term quantum processors has been introduced to the
AI community. The research demonstrated that temporal planning is a strong
approach for a class of quantum circuit compilation (QCC) problems. In this
paper, we explore the use of constraint programming (CP) as an alternative and
complementary approach to temporal planning. We extend previous work by
introducing two new problem variations that incorporate important
characteristics identified by the quantum computing community. We apply
temporal planning and CP to the baseline and extended QCC problems as both
stand-alone and hybrid approaches. Our hybrid methods use solutions found by
temporal planning to warm start CP, leveraging the ability of the former to
find satisficing solutions to problems with a high degree of task optionality,
an area that CP typically struggles with. The CP model, benefiting from
inferred bounds on planning horizon length and task counts provided by the warm
start, is then used to find higher quality solutions. Our empirical evaluation
indicates that while stand-alone CP is only competitive for the smallest
problems, CP in our hybridization with temporal planning out-performs
stand-alone temporal planning in the majority of problem classes.
"
1103,"Experimental Molecular Communication Testbed Based on Magnetic
  Nanoparticles in Duct Flow","  Simple and easy to implement testbeds are needed to further advance molecular
communication research. To this end, this paper presents an in-vessel molecular
communication testbed using magnetic nanoparticles dispersed in an aqueous
suspension as they are also used for drug targeting in biotechnology. The
transmitter is realized by an electronic pump for injection via a Y-connector.
A second pump provides a background flow for signal propagation. For signal
reception, we employ a susceptometer, an electronic device including a coil,
where the magnetic particles move through and generate an electrical signal. We
present experimental results for the transmission of a binary sequence and the
system response following a single injection. For this flow-driven particle
transport, we propose a simple parameterized mathematical model for evaluating
the system response.

1104,High Speed and Low Power Sensing Schemes for STT-MRAM with IPMTJs,"  STT-MRAM with interfacial-anisotropy-type perpendicular MTJ (IPMTJ) is a
powerful candidate for the low switching energy design of STT-MRAM. In the
literature, the reading operation of STT-MRAM structured with IPMTJs have been
not studied until this time, in our knowledge. We investigated the reading
operation of STT-MRAM structured with IPMTJs. To enumerate the read operations
of the NVSenseAmp have successfully been performed a 2.5X reduction in average
low power and a 13X increase in average high speed compared with the previous
works.
"
1105,Quality Attributes on Quantum Computing Platforms,"  As the practical Quantum Computing Platforms (QCPs) rapidly become a reality,
it is desirable to harness their true potential in software applications. Thus
it becomes important to determine the implications of QCPs for software
architecture. In this paper we present the in-depth examination of
state-of-the-art QCPs for identifying all such characteristics of a QCP that
are relevant from software architecture perspective. Lack of a native quantum
operating system, a hard dependency on quantum algorithms, the lower level of
programming abstractions are few, out of many, examples of QCP characteristics
which may affect architecture of quantum software applications. Key
contributions of this paper include identifying: i) The general architecture of
a QCP, ii) The programming model which is typically used when developing
software for a QCP, iii) Architecturally significant characteristics of QCPs
and iv) The impact of these characteristics on various Quality Attributes
(QAs). We show that except performance and scalability, most of the other QAs
(e.g. maintainability, testability, reliability etc.) are adversely affected by
different characteristics of a QCP.
"
1106,"A Novel Approach for Fast and Accurate Mean Error Distance Computation
  in Approximate Adders","  In error-tolerant applications, approximate adders have been exploited
extensively to achieve energy efficient system designs. Mean error distance is
one of the important error metrics used as a performance measure of approximate
adders. In this work, a fast and efficient methodology is proposed to determine
the exact mean error distance in approximate lower significant bit adders. A
detailed description of the proposed algorithm along with an example has been
demonstrated in this paper. Experimental analysis shows that the proposed
method performs better than existing Monte Carlo simulation approach both in
terms of accuracy and execution time.
"
1107,Visible Light Communication for Wearable Computing,"  Visible Light Communication (VLC) is emerging as a means to network computing
devices that ameliorates many hurdles of radio-frequency (RF) communications,
for example, the limited available spectrum. Enabling VLC in wearable
computing, however, is challenging because mobility induces unpredictable
drastic changes in light conditions, for example, due to reflective surfaces
and obstacles casting shadows. We experimentally demonstrate that such changes
are so extreme that no single design of a VLC receiver can provide efficient
performance across the board. The diversity found in current wearable devices
complicates matters. Based on these observations, we present three different
designs of VLC receivers that i) are individually orders of magnitude more
efficient than the state-of-the-art in a subset of the possible conditions, and
i) can be combined in a single unit that dynamically switches to the best
performing receiver based on the light conditions. Our evaluation indicates
that dynamic switching incurs minimal overhead, that we can obtain throughput
in the order of MBit/s, and at energy costs lower than many RF devices.
"
1108,"Hardware based Spatio-Temporal Neural Processing Backend for Imaging
  Sensors: Towards a Smart Camera","  In this work we show how we can build a technology platform for cognitive
imaging sensors using recent advances in recurrent neural network architectures
and training methods inspired from biology. We demonstrate learning and
processing tasks specific to imaging sensors, including enhancement of
sensitivity and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) purely through neural filtering
beyond the fundamental limits sensor materials, and inferencing and
spatio-temporal pattern recognition capabilities of these networks with
applications in object detection, motion tracking and prediction. We then show
designs of unit hardware cells built using complementary metal-oxide
semiconductor (CMOS) and emerging materials technologies for ultra-compact and
energy-efficient embedded neural processors for smart cameras.
"
1109,"Scalable photonic reinforcement learning by time-division multiplexing
  of laser chaos","  Reinforcement learning involves decision making in dynamic and uncertain
environments and constitutes a crucial element of artificial intelligence. In
our previous work, we experimentally demonstrated that the ultrafast chaotic
oscillatory dynamics of lasers can be used to solve the two-armed bandit
problem efficiently, which requires decision making concerning a class of
difficult trade-offs called the exploration-exploitation dilemma. However, only
two selections were employed in that research; thus, the scalability of the
laser-chaos-based reinforcement learning should be clarified. In this study, we
demonstrated a scalable, pipelined principle of resolving the multi-armed
bandit problem by introducing time-division multiplexing of chaotically
oscillated ultrafast time-series. The experimental demonstrations in which
bandit problems with up to 64 arms were successfully solved are presented in
this report. Detailed analyses are also provided that include performance
comparisons among laser chaos signals generated in different physical
conditions, which coincide with the diffusivity inherent in the time series.
This study paves the way for ultrafast reinforcement learning by taking
advantage of the ultrahigh bandwidths of light wave and practical enabling
technologies.
"
1110,Noise-based logic gates by operations on the reference system,"  We propose a new, low-complexity solution to realize multi-input-bit gates
acting on exponentially large superpositions in noise-based logic processors.
Two examples are shown, the NOT gate and the CNOT gate. The operations can be
executed and repeated with polynomial time and hardware complexity. The lack of
a solution of this problem had been one of the major issues prohibiting the
efficient realization of Shor's algorithm by Instantaneous Noise-Based Logic,
which runs on a classical Turing computer with a true random number generator.
With the method described in this paper, we are one step closer to this goal.
"
1111,Real-Time Computability of Real Numbers by Chemical Reaction Networks,"  We explore the class of real numbers that are computed in real time by
deterministic chemical reaction networks that are integral in the sense that
all their reaction rate constants are positive integers. We say that such a
reaction network computes a real number $\alpha$ in real time if it has a
designated species $X$ such that, when all species concentrations are set to
zero at time $t = 0$, the concentration $x(t)$ of $X$ is within $2^{-t}$ of
$|{\alpha}|$ at all times $t \ge 1$, and the concentrations of all other
species are bounded. We show that every algebraic number and some
transcendental numbers are real time computable by chemical reaction networks
in this sense. We discuss possible implications of this for the 1965
Hartmanis-Stearns conjecture, which says that no irrational algebraic number is
real time computable by a Turing machine.
"
1112,"New Symmetric and Planar Designs of Reversible Full-Adders/Subtractors
  in Quantum-Dot Cellular Automata","  Quantum-dot Cellular Automata (QCA) is one of the emerging nanotechnologies,
promising alternative to CMOS technology due to faster speed, smaller size,
lower power consumption, higher scale integration and higher switching
frequency. Also, power dissipation is the main limitation of all the nano
electronics design techniques including the QCA. Researchers have proposed the
various mechanisms to limit this problem. Among them, reversible computing is
considered as the reliable solution to lower the power dissipation. On the
other hand, adders are fundamental circuits for most digital systems. In this
paper, Innovation is divided to three sections. In the first section, a method
for converting irreversible functions to a reversible one is presented. This
method has advantages such as: converting of irreversible functions to
reversible one directly and as optimal. So, in this method, sub-optimal methods
of using of conventional reversible blocks such as Toffoli and Fredkin are not
used, having of minimum number of garbage outputs and so on. Then, Using the
method, two new symmetric and planar designs of reversible full-adders are
presented. In the second section, a new symmetric, planar and fault tolerant
five-input majority gate is proposed. Based on the designed gate, a reversible
full-adder are presented. Also, for this gate, a fault-tolerant analysis is
proposed. And in the third section, three new 8-bit reversible
full-adder/subtractors are designed based on full-adders/subtractors proposed
in the second section. The results are indicative of the outperformance of the
proposed designs in comparison to the best available ones in terms of area,
complexity, delay, reversible/irreversible layout, and also in logic level in
terms of garbage outputs, control inputs, number of majority and NOT gates.

1113,"Reversible Gates in Emerging Quantum-dot Cellular Automata Technology:
  An Innovative Approach to Design and Simulation","  Power dissipation is known as the most notable limiting factor in all
nano-electronic design techniques including Quantum-dot Cellular Automata
(QCA). The familiar reversible computing approach is used as a reasonably
reliable solution, mitigating power dissipation. This study presents, a
comprehensive multi-objective method for designing R-Fs in emerging QCA
technology. The results are investigated in both logical and layout levels, in
detail. The results verify that the approach offered in this study has
advantage over the most efficient approaches available in the literature by
far. This comparison can be made on various parameters ranging from area,
complexity (cell amount), delay (clocking zones), and to even logical levels
including levels, Control inputs, the number of majority and NOT gates.

1114,"Hardware design of LIF with Latency neuron model with memristive STDP
  synapses","  In this paper, the hardware implementation of a neuromorphic system is
presented. This system is composed of a Leaky Integrate-and-Fire with Latency
(LIFL) neuron and a Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP) synapse. LIFL
neuron model allows to encode more information than the common
Integrate-and-Fire models, typically considered for neuromorphic
implementations. In our system LIFL neuron is implemented using CMOS circuits
while memristor is used for the implementation of the STDP synapse. A
description of the entire circuit is provided. Finally, the capabilities of the
proposed architecture have been evaluated by simulating a motif composed of
three neurons and two synapses. The simulation results confirm the validity of
the proposed system and its suitability for the design of more complex spiking
neural networks
"
1115,"Toward Fast Neural Computing using All-Photonic Phase Change Spiking
  Neurons","  The rapid growth of brain-inspired computing coupled with the inefficiencies
in the CMOS implementations of neuromrphic systems has led to intense
exploration of efficient hardware implementations of the functional units of
the brain, namely, neurons and synapses. However, efforts have largely been
invested in implementations in the electrical domain with potential limitations
of switching speed, packing density of large integrated systems and
interconnect losses. As an alternative, neuromorphic engineering in the
photonic domain has recently gained attention. In this work, we demonstrate a
purely photonic operation of an Integrate-and-Fire Spiking neuron, based on the
phase change dynamics of Ge$_2$Sb$_2$Te$_5$ (GST) embedded on top of a
microring resonator, which alleviates the energy constraints of PCMs in
electrical domain. We also show that such a neuron can be potentially
integrated with on-chip synapses into an all-Photonic Spiking Neural network
inferencing framework which promises to be ultrafast and can potentially offer
a large operating bandwidth.
"
1116,"Reactive NaN Repair for Applying Approximate Memory to Numerical
  Applications","  Applications in the AI and HPC fields require much memory capacity, and the
amount of energy consumed by main memory of server machines is ever increasing.
Energy consumption of main memory can be greatly reduced by applying
approximate computing in exchange for increased bit error rates. AI and HPC
applications are to some extent robust to bit errors because small numerical
errors are amortized by their iterative nature. However, a single occurrence of
a NaN due to bit-flips corrupts the whole calculation result. The issue is that
fixing every bit-flip using ECC incurs too much overhead because the bit error
rate is much higher than in normal environments. We propose a low-overhead
method to fix NaNs when approximate computing is applied to main memory. The
main idea is to reactively repair NaNs while leaving other non-fatal numerical
errors as-is to reduce the overhead. We implemented a prototype by leveraging
floating-point exceptions of x86 CPUs, and the preliminary evaluations showed
that our method incurs negligible overhead.
"
1117,MASTISK,"  In this paper, we present MASTISK (MAchine-learning and Synaptic-plasticity
Technology Integrated Simulation frameworK). MASTISK is an open-source
versatile and flexible tool developed in MATLAB for design exploration of
dedicated neuromorphic hardware using nanodevices and hybrid CMOS-nanodevice
circuits. MASTISK has a hierarchical organization capturing details at the
level of devices, circuits (i.e. neurons or activation functions, synapses or
weights) and architectures (i.e. topology, learning-rules, algorithms). In the
current version, MASTISK provides user-friendly interface for design and
simulation of spiking neural networks (SNN) powered by spatio-temporal learning
rules such as Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP). Users may provide
network definition as a simple input parameter file and the framework is
capable of performing automated learning/inference simulations. Validation
case-studies of the proposed open source simulator will be published in the
proceedings of IJCNN 2018. The proposed framework offers new functionalities,
compared to similar simulation tools in literature, such as: (i) arbitrary
synaptic circuit modeling capability with both identical and non-identical
stimuli, (ii) arbitrary spike modeling, and (iii) nanodevice based neuron
emulation. The code of MASTISK is available on request at:

1118,A Mixed-Signal Structured AdEx Neuron for Accelerated Neuromorphic Cores,"  Here we describe a multi-compartment neuron circuit based on the
Adaptive-Exponential I&F (AdEx) model, developed for the second-generation
BrainScaleS hardware. Based on an existing modular Leaky Integrate-and-Fire
(LIF) architecture designed in 65 nm CMOS, the circuit features exponential
spike generation, neuronal adaptation, inter-compartmental connections as well
as a conductance-based reset. The design reproduces a diverse set of firing
patterns observed in cortical pyramidal neurons. Further, it enables the
emulation of sodium and calcium spikes, as well as N-Methyl-D-Aspartate (NMDA)
plateau potentials known from apical and thin dendrites. We characterize the
AdEx circuit extensions and exemplify how the interplay between passive and
non-linear active signal processing enhances the computational capabilities of
single (but structured) on-chip neurons.
"
1119,"An Accelerated LIF Neuronal Network Array for a Large Scale Mixed-Signal
  Neuromorphic Architecture","  We present an array of leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron circuits
designed for the second-generation BrainScaleS mixed-signal 65-nm CMOS
neuromorphic hardware. The neuronal array is embedded in the analog network
core of a scaled-down prototype HICANN-DLS chip. Designed as continuous-time
circuits, the neurons are highly tunable and reconfigurable elements with
accelerated dynamics. Each neuron integrates input current from a multitude of
incoming synapses and evokes a digital spike event output. The circuit offers a
wide tuning range for synaptic and membrane time constants, as well as for
refractory periods to cover a number of computational models. We elucidate our
design methodology, underlying circuit design, calibration and measurement
results from individual sub-circuits across multiple dies. The circuit dynamics
match with the behavior of the LIF mathematical model. We further demonstrate a
winner-take-all network on the prototype chip as a typical element of cortical
processing.
"
1120,"Probabilistic Value-Deviation-Bounded Integer Codes for Approximate
  Communication","  When computing systems can tolerate the effects of errors or erasures in
their communicated data values, they can trade this tolerance for improved
resource efficiency. One method for enabling this tradeoff in the I/O
subsystems of computing systems, is to use channel codes that reduce the power
needed to send bits on a channel in exchange for bounded errors and erasures on
numeric program values---value-deviation-bounded (VDB) codes. Unlike rate
distortion codes, which guarantee a bound on the expected value of channel
distortion, the probabilistic VDB codes we present guarantee any desired tail
distribution on integer distances of words transmitted over a channel. We
extend prior work to present tighter upper bounds on the efficiency for VDB
codes. We present a new probabilistic VDB encoder that lowers power dissipation
in exchange for bounded channel integer distortions. The code we present takes
the peculiar approach of changing the channel bit error rate across the ordinal
bit positions in a word to reduce power dissipation. We implement the code
table generator in a software tool built on the dReal SMT solver and we
validate the generated codes using Monte Carlo simulation. We present one
realization of hardware to implement the technique, requiring 2 mm$^2$ of
circuit board area and dissipating less than 0.5 $\mu$W.
"
1121,Energy-Quality Scaling in Analog Mesh Computers,"  The recent push for post-Moore computer architectures has introduced a wide
variety of application-specific accelerators. One particular accelerator, the
resistance network analogue, has been well received due to its ability to
efficiently solve partial differential equations by eliminating the iterative
stages required by today's numerical solvers. However, in the ago of
programmable integrated circuits, the static nature of the resistance network
analogue, and other analog mesh computers like it, has relegated it to an
academic curiosity. Recent developments in materials, such as the memristor,
have made the resistance network analogue viable for inclusion in future
heterogeneous computer architectures. However, selection of an appropriate
sized mesh to be incorporated into a computer system requires that
energy-quality trade-offs are made regarding the problem size and required
resolution of the solution. This paper provides an in-depth study of the
scaling of analog mesh computer hardware, from the perspective of energy per
bit and required resolution, introduces a metric to aid in quantifying analog
mesh computers with different parameters, and introduces a method of
virtualization which enables an analog mesh computer of a fixed size to
approximate the calculations of a larger-sized mesh.

1122,"Module-less Synthesis on Cyberphysical Digital Microfluidic Biochip
  Ensuring Error Detection and Routing Performance Optimization","  Digital Microfluidic Biochips consist of Two Dimensional microarrays that are
integrated with different healthcare related cyberphysical systems and expected
to be used extensively in near future. Thus, faster and error-free synthesis
techniques need to be implemented on such chips. Various Bio protocols are
performed based on different mixing modules present on the chip until now. In
this work, the concept of such dedicated virtual modules has been eliminated
and a novel Module Less Synthesis method is proposed for accomplishing
bioassays for cyberphysical DMFBs. However, path congestion problem and
operational errors are inevitable in MLS approach.
"
1123,Data Driven Optimizations for MTJ based Stochastic Computing,"  Stochastic computing, a form of computation with probabilities, presents an
alternative to conventional arithmetic units. Magnetic Tunnel Junctions (MTJs),
which exhibit probabilistic switching, have been explored as Stochastic Number
Generators (SNGs). We provide a perspective of the energy requirements of such
an application and design an energy-efficient and data-sensitive MTJ-based SNG.
We discuss its benefits when used for stochastic computations, illustrating
with the help of a multiplier circuit, in terms of energy savings when compared
to computing with the baseline MTJ-SNG.
"
1124,"Impulse Response of the Channel with a Spherical Absorbing Receiver and
  a Spherical Reflecting Boundary","  In this letter, we derive the impulse response of the channel with a
spherical absorbing receiver, a spherical reflecting boundary, and a point
transmitter in molecular communication domain. By exploring the channel
characteristics and drawing comparisons with the unbounded case, we show the
consequences of having the boundary on channel properties such as peak time,
peak amplitude, and total fraction of molecules to hit the receiver. Finally,
we calculate the bit error rate for both bounded and unbounded channels and
emphasize the significance of incorporating the boundary on understanding the
realistic behavior of a channel.
"
1125,"Towards Training Probabilistic Topic Models on Neuromorphic Multi-chip
  Systems","  Probabilistic topic models are popular unsupervised learning methods,
including probabilistic latent semantic indexing (pLSI) and latent Dirichlet
allocation (LDA). By now, their training is implemented on general purpose
computers (GPCs), which are flexible in programming but energy-consuming.
Towards low-energy implementations, this paper investigates their training on
an emerging hardware technology called the neuromorphic multi-chip systems
(NMSs). NMSs are very effective for a family of algorithms called spiking
neural networks (SNNs). We present three SNNs to train topic models. The first
SNN is a batch algorithm combining the conventional collapsed Gibbs sampling
(CGS) algorithm and an inference SNN to train LDA. The other two SNNs are
online algorithms targeting at both energy- and storage-limited environments.
The two online algorithms are equivalent with training LDA by using
maximum-a-posterior estimation and maximizing the semi-collapsed likelihood,
respectively. They use novel, tailored ordinary differential equations for
stochastic optimization. We simulate the new algorithms and show that they are
comparable with the GPC algorithms, while being suitable for NMS
implementation. We also propose an extension to train pLSI and a method to
prune the network to obey the limited fan-in of some NMSs.
"
1126,Quantum Algorithm Implementations for Beginners,"  As quantum computers become available to the general public, the need has
arisen to train a cohort of quantum programmers, many of whom have been
developing classical computer programs for most of their careers. While
currently available quantum computers have less than 100 qubits, quantum
computing hardware is widely expected to grow in terms of qubit count, quality,
and connectivity. This review aims to explain the principles of quantum
programming, which are quite different from classical programming, with
straightforward algebra that makes understanding of the underlying fascinating
quantum mechanical principles optional. We give an introduction to quantum
computing algorithms and their implementation on real quantum hardware. We
survey 20 different quantum algorithms, attempting to describe each in a
succinct and self-contained fashion. We show how these algorithms can be
implemented on IBM's quantum computer, and in each case, we discuss the results
of the implementation with respect to differences between the simulator and the
actual hardware runs. This article introduces computer scientists, physicists,
and engineers to quantum algorithms and provides a blueprint for their
implementations.
"
1127,"Biological Optical-to-Chemical Signal Conversion Interface: A
  Small-scale Modulator for Molecular Communications","  Although many exciting applications of molecular communication (MC) systems
are envisioned to be at microscale, the available MC testbeds reported in the
literature so far are mostly at macroscale. This may partially be due to the
fact that controlling an MC system at microscale is quite challenging. To link
the macroworld to the microworld, we propose a biological signal conversion
interface that can also be seen as a microscale modulator. This interface
translates an optical signal, which can be easily controlled using a
light-emitting diode (LED), into a chemical signal by changing the pH of the
environment. The modulator is realized using \textit{Escherichia coli} bacteria
that express the light-driven proton pump gloeorhodopsin from
\textit{Gloeobacter violaceus}. Upon inducing external light stimuli, these
bacteria can locally change their surrounding pH level by exporting protons
into the environment. Based on measurement data from a testbed, we develop an
analytical model for the induced chemical signal as a function of the applied
optical signal. Finally, using a pH sensor as detector, we show for an example
scenario that the proposed setup is able to successfully convert an optical
signal representing a sequence of binary symbols into a chemical signal with a
bit rate of $1$~bit/min.
"
1128,"Synchronization for Diffusion-based Molecular Communication Systems via
  Faster Molecules","  In this paper, we address the symbol synchronization issue in molecular
communication via diffusion (MCvD). Symbol synchronization among chemical
sensors and nanomachines is one of the critical challenges to manage complex
tasks in the nanonetworks with molecular communication (MC). As in
diffusion-based MC, most of the molecules arrive at the receptor closer to the
start of the symbol duration, the wrong estimation of the start of the symbol
interval leads to a high symbol detection error. By utilizing two types of
molecules with different diffusion coefficients we propose a synchronization
technique for MCvD. Moreover, we evaluate the symbol-error-rate performance
under the proposed symbol synchronization scheme for equal and non-equal symbol
duration in MCvD systems.

1129,"A 0.086-mm$^2$ 12.7-pJ/SOP 64k-Synapse 256-Neuron Online-Learning
  Digital Spiking Neuromorphic Processor in 28nm CMOS","  Shifting computing architectures from von Neumann to event-based spiking
neural networks (SNNs) uncovers new opportunities for low-power processing of
sensory data in applications such as vision or sensorimotor control. Exploring
roads toward cognitive SNNs requires the design of compact, low-power and
versatile experimentation platforms with the key requirement of online learning
in order to adapt and learn new features in uncontrolled environments. However,
embedding online learning in SNNs is currently hindered by high incurred
complexity and area overheads. In this work, we present ODIN, a 0.086-mm$^2$
64k-synapse 256-neuron online-learning digital spiking neuromorphic processor
in 28nm FDSOI CMOS achieving a minimum energy per synaptic operation (SOP) of
12.7pJ. It leverages an efficient implementation of the spike-driven synaptic
plasticity (SDSP) learning rule for high-density embedded online learning with
only 0.68$\mu$m$^2$ per 4-bit synapse. Neurons can be independently configured
as a standard leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) model or as a custom
phenomenological model that emulates the 20 Izhikevich behaviors found in
biological spiking neurons. Using a single presentation of 6k 16$\times$16
MNIST training images to a single-layer fully-connected 10-neuron network with
on-chip SDSP-based learning, ODIN achieves a classification accuracy of 84.5%
while consuming only 15nJ/inference at 0.55V using rank order coding. ODIN thus
enables further developments toward cognitive neuromorphic devices for
low-power, adaptive and low-cost processing.
"
1130,A reaction network scheme which implements the EM algorithm,"  A detailed algorithmic explanation is required for how a network of chemical
reactions can generate the sophisticated behavior displayed by living cells.
Though several previous works have shown that reaction networks are
computationally universal and can in principle implement any algorithm, there
is scope for constructions that map well onto biological reality, make
efficient use of the computational potential of the native dynamics of reaction
networks, and make contact with statistical mechanics. We describe a new
reaction network scheme for solving a large class of statistical problems
including the problem of how a cell would infer its environment from
receptor-ligand bindings. Specifically we show how reaction networks can
implement information projection, and consequently a generalized
Expectation-Maximization algorithm, to solve maximum likelihood estimation
problems in partially-observed exponential families on categorical data. Our
scheme can be thought of as an algorithmic interpretation of E. T. Jaynes's
vision of statistical mechanics as statistical inference.

1131,"A Hardware Platform for Efficient Multi-Modal Sensing with Adaptive
  Approximation","  We present Warp, a hardware platform to support research in approximate
computing, sensor energy optimization, and energy-scavenged systems. Warp
incorporates 11 state-of-the-art sensor integrated circuits, computation, and
an energy-scavenged power supply, all within a miniature system that is just
3.6 cm x 3.3 cm x 0.5 cm. Warp's sensor integrated circuits together contain a
total of 21 sensors with a range of precisions and accuracies for measuring
eight sensing modalities of acceleration, angular rate, magnetic flux density
(compass heading), humidity, atmospheric pressure (elevation), infrared
radiation, ambient temperature, and color. Warp uses a combination of analog
circuits and digital control to facilitate further tradeoffs between sensor and
communication accuracy, energy efficiency, and performance. This article
presents the design of Warp and presents an evaluation of our hardware
implementation. The results show how Warp's design enables performance and
energy efficiency versus ac- curacy tradeoffs.

1132,"Memristor Crossbars with 4.5 Terabits-per-Inch-Square Density and Two
  Nanometer Dimension","  Memristor is a promising building block for the next generation nonvolatile
random access memory and bio-inspired computing systems. Organizing memristors
into high density crossbar arrays, although challenging, is critical to meet
the ever-growing high capacity and low energy demands of these applications
especially in the big data era. Here, we construct memristor crossbars with a
single-layer density up to 4.5 terabits per inch square, an order of magnitude
denser than the state- of-the-art 64-layer triple level cell NAND flash
technology. The memristors in the crossbars are 2 $\times$ 2 nm$^2$ in size,
capable of switching with tens of nano ampere electric current. The densely
packed memristor crossbars of extremely small working devices provides a
power-efficient solution for high density information storage and processing.
"
1133,"Analysis of Service-oriented Modeling Approaches for Viewpoint-specific
  Model-driven Development of Microservice Architecture","  Microservice Architecture (MSA) is a novel service-based architectural style
for distributed software systems. Compared to Service-oriented Architecture
(SOA), MSA puts a stronger focus on self-containment of services. Each
microservice is responsible for realizing exactly one business or technological
capability that is distinct from other services' capabilities. Additionally, on
the implementation and operation level, microservices are self-contained in
that they are developed, tested, deployed and operated independently from each
other. Next to these characteristics that distinguish MSA from SOA, both
architectural styles rely on services as building blocks of distributed
software architecture and hence face similar challenges regarding, e.g.,
service identification, composition and provisioning. However, in contrast to
MSA, SOA may rely on an extensive body of knowledge to tackle these challenges.
Thus, due to both architectural styles being service-based, the question arises
to what degree MSA might draw on existing findings of SOA research and
practice. In this paper we address this question in the field of Model-driven
Development (MDD) for design and operation of service-based architectures.
Therefore, we present an analysis of existing MDD approaches to SOA, which
comprises the identification and semantic clustering of modeling concepts for
SOA design and operation. For each concept cluster, the analysis assesses its
applicability to MDD of MSA (MSA-MDD) and assigns it to a specific modeling
viewpoint. The goal of the presented analysis is to provide a conceptual
foundation for an MSA-MDD metamodel.
"
1134,"A General Analytical Approximation to Impulse Response of 3-D
  Microfluidic Channels in Molecular Communication","  In this paper, the impulse response for a 3-D microfluidic channel in the
presence of Poiseuille flow is obtained by solving the diffusion equation in
radial coordinates. Using the radial distribution, the axial distribution is
then approximated accordingly. Since Poiseuille flow velocity changes with
radial position, molecules have different axial properties for different radial
distributions. We, therefore, present a piecewise function for the axial
distribution of the molecules in the channel considering this radial
distribution. Finally, we lay evidence for our theoretical derivations for
impulse response of the microfluidic channel and radial distribution of
molecules through comparing them using various Monte Carlo simulations.
"
1135,Spiking Neural Algorithms for Markov Process Random Walk,"  The random walk is a fundamental stochastic process that underlies many
numerical tasks in scientific computing applications. We consider here two
neural algorithms that can be used to efficiently implement random walks on
spiking neuromorphic hardware. The first method tracks the positions of
individual walkers independently by using a modular code inspired by the grid
cell spatial representation in the brain. The second method tracks the
densities of random walkers at each spatial location directly. We analyze the
scaling complexity of each of these methods and illustrate their ability to
model random walkers under different probabilistic conditions.
"
1136,Advanced Target Detection via Molecular Communication,"  In this paper, we consider target detection in suspicious tissue via
diffusive molecular communications (MCs). If a target is present, it
continuously and with a constant rate secretes molecules of a specific type,
so-called biomarkers, into the medium, which are symptomatic for the presence
of the target. Detection of these biomarkers is challenging since due to the
diffusion and degradation, the biomarkers are only detectable in the vicinity
of the target. In addition, the exact location of the target within the tissue
is not known. In this paper, we propose to distribute several reactive
nanosensors (NSs) across the tissue such that at least some of them are
expected to come in contact with biomarkers, which cause them to become
activated. Upon activation, an NS releases a certain number of molecules of a
secondary type into the medium to alert a fusion center (FC), where the final
decision regarding the presence of the target is made. In particular, we
consider a composite hypothesis testing framework where it is assumed that the
location of the target and the biomarker secretion rate are unknown, whereas
the locations of the NSs are known. We derive the uniformly most powerful (UMP)
test for the detection at the NSs. For the final decision at the FC, we show
that the UMP test does not exist. Hence, we derive a genie-aided detector as an
upper bound on performance. We then propose two sub-optimal detectors and
evaluate their performance via simulations
"
1137,Superconducting Optoelectronic Neurons I: General Principles,"  The design of neural hardware is informed by the prominence of differentiated
processing and information integration in cognitive systems. The central role
of communication leads to the principal assumption of the hardware platform:
signals between neurons should be optical to enable fanout and communication
with minimal delay. The requirement of energy efficiency leads to the
utilization of superconducting detectors to receive single-photon signals. We
discuss the potential of superconducting optoelectronic hardware to achieve the
spatial and temporal information integration advantageous for cognitive
processing, and we consider physical scaling limits based on light-speed
communication. We introduce the superconducting optoelectronic neurons and
networks that are the subject of the subsequent papers in this series.
"
1138,Superconducting Optoelectronic Neurons III: Synaptic Plasticity,"  As a means of dynamically reconfiguring the synaptic weight of a
superconducting optoelectronic loop neuron, a superconducting flux storage loop
is inductively coupled to the synaptic current bias of the neuron. A standard
flux memory cell is used to achieve a binary synapse, and loops capable of
storing many flux quanta are used to enact multi-stable synapses. Circuits are
designed to implement supervised learning wherein current pulses add or remove
flux from the loop to strengthen or weaken the synaptic weight. Designs are
presented for circuits with hundreds of intermediate synaptic weights between
minimum and maximum strengths. Circuits for implementing unsupervised learning
are modeled using two photons to strengthen and two photons to weaken the
synaptic weight via Hebbian and anti-Hebbian learning rules, and techniques are
proposed to control the learning rate. Implementation of short-term plasticity,
homeostatic plasticity, and metaplasticity in loop neurons is discussed.
"
1139,Superconducting Optoelectronic Neurons IV: Transmitter Circuits,"  A superconducting optoelectronic neuron will produce a small current pulse
upon reaching threshold. We present an amplifier chain that converts this small
current pulse to a voltage pulse sufficient to produce light from a
semiconductor diode. This light is the signal used to communicate between
neurons in the network. The amplifier chain comprises a thresholding Josephson
junction, a relaxation oscillator Josephson junction, a superconducting
thin-film current-gated current amplifier, and a superconducting thin-film
current-gated voltage amplifier. We analyze the performance of the elements in
the amplifier chain in the time domain to calculate the energy consumption per
photon created for several values of light-emitting diode capacitance and
efficiency. The speed of the amplification sequence allows neuronal firing up
to at least 20\,MHz with power density low enough to be cooled easily with
standard $^4$He cryogenic systems operating at 4.2\,K.
"
1140,Superconducting Optoelectronic Neurons V: Networks and Scaling,"  Networks of superconducting optoelectronic neurons are investigated for their
near-term technological potential and long-term physical limitations. Networks
with short average path length, high clustering coefficient, and power-law
degree distribution are designed using a growth model that assigns connections
between new and existing nodes based on spatial distance as well as degree of
existing nodes. The network construction algorithm is scalable to arbitrary
levels of network hierarchy and achieves systems with fractal spatial
properties and efficient wiring. By modeling the physical size of
superconducting optoelectronic neurons, we calculate the area of these
networks. A system with 8100 neurons and 330,430 total synapses will fit on a
1\,cm $\times$ 1\,cm die. Systems of millions of neurons with hundreds of
millions of synapses will fit on a 300\,mm wafer. For multi-wafer assemblies,
communication at light speed enables a neuronal pool the size of a large data
center comprising 100 trillion neurons with coherent oscillations at 1\,MHz.
Assuming a power law frequency distribution, as is necessary for self-organized
criticality, we calculate the power consumption of the networks. We find the
use of single photons for communication and superconducting circuits for
computation leads to power density low enough to be cooled by liquid $^4$He for
networks of any scale.
"
1141,Circuit designs for superconducting optoelectronic loop neurons,"  Optical communication achieves high fanout and short delay advantageous for
information integration in neural systems. Superconducting detectors enable
signaling with single photons for maximal energy efficiency. We present designs
of superconducting optoelectronic neurons based on superconducting
single-photon detectors, Josephson junctions, semiconductor light sources, and
multi-planar dielectric waveguides. These circuits achieve complex synaptic and
neuronal functions with high energy efficiency, leveraging the strengths of
light for communication and superconducting electronics for computation. The
neurons send few-photon signals to synaptic connections. These signals
communicate neuronal firing events as well as update synaptic weights.
Spike-timing-dependent plasticity is implemented with a single photon
triggering each step of the process. Microscale light-emitting diodes and
waveguide networks enable connectivity from a neuron to thousands of synaptic
connections, and the use of light for communication enables synchronization of
neurons across an area limited only by the distance light can travel within the
period of a network oscillation. Experimentally, each of the requisite circuit
elements has been demonstrated, yet a hardware platform combining them all has
not been attempted. Compared to digital logic or quantum computing, device
tolerances are relaxed. For this neural application, optical sources providing
incoherent pulses with 10,000 photons produced with efficiency of 10$^{-3}$
operating at 20\,MHz at 4.2\,K are sufficient to enable a massively scalable
neural computing platform with connectivity comparable to the brain and thirty
thousand times higher speed.
"
1142,Quantum Circuits for Toom-Cook Multiplication,"  In this paper, we report efficient quantum circuits for integer
multiplication using Toom-Cook algorithm. By analysing the recursive tree
structure of the algorithm, we obtained a bound on the count of Toffoli gates
and qubits. These bounds are further improved by employing reversible pebble
games through uncomputing the intermediate results. The asymptotic bounds for
different performance metrics of the proposed quantum circuit are superior to
the prior implementations of multiplier circuits using schoolbook and Karatsuba
algorithms.
"
1143,Superconducting Optoelectronic Neurons II: Receiver Circuits,"  Circuits using superconducting single-photon detectors and Josephson
junctions to perform signal reception, synaptic weighting, and integration are
investigated. The circuits convert photon-detection events into flux quanta,
the number of which is determined by the synaptic weight. The current from many
synaptic connections is inductively coupled to a superconducting loop that
implements the neuronal threshold operation. Designs are presented for synapses
and neurons that perform integration as well as detect coincidence events for
temporal coding. Both excitatory and inhibitory connections are demonstrated.
It is shown that a neuron with a single integration loop can receive input from
1000 such synaptic connections, and neurons of similar design could employ many
loops for dendritic processing.
"
1144,Hierarchical Temporal Memory using Memristor Networks: A Survey,"  This paper presents a survey of the currently available hardware designs for
implementation of the human cortex inspired algorithm, Hierarchical Temporal
Memory (HTM). In this review, we focus on the state of the art advances of
memristive HTM implementation and related HTM applications. With the advent of
edge computing, HTM can be a potential algorithm to implement on-chip near
sensor data processing. The comparison of analog memristive circuit
implementations with the digital and mixed-signal solutions are provided. The
advantages of memristive HTM over digital implementations against performance
metrics such as processing speed, reduced on-chip area and power dissipation
are discussed. The limitations and open problems concerning the memristive HTM,
such as the design scalability, sneak currents, leakage, parasitic effects,
lack of the analog learning circuits implementations and unreliability of the
memristive devices integrated with CMOS circuits are also discussed.
"
1145,Efficient Design of Hardware-Enabled Reservoir Computing in FPGAs,"  In this work, we propose a new approach towards the efficient optimization
and implementation of reservoir computing hardware reducing the required domain
expert knowledge and optimization effort. First, we adapt the reservoir input
mask to the structure of the data via linear autoencoders. We therefore
incorporate the advantages of dimensionality reduction and dimensionality
expansion achieved by conventional algorithmically efficient linear algebra
procedures of principal component analysis. Second, we employ
evolutionary-inspired genetic algorithm techniques resulting in a highly
efficient optimization of reservoir dynamics with dramatically reduced number
of evaluations comparing to exhaustive search. We illustrate the method on the
so-called single-node reservoir computing architecture, especially suitable for
implementation in ultrahigh-speed hardware. The combination of both methods and
the resulting reduction of time required for performance optimization of a
hardware system establish a strategy towards machine learning hardware capable
of self-adaption to optimally solve specific problems. We confirm the validity
of those principles building reservoir computing hardware based on a
field-programmable gate array.

1146,Pushing the limits of optical information storage using deep learning,"  Diffraction drastically limits the bit density in optical data storage. To
increase the storage density, alternative strategies involving supplementary
recording dimensions and robust read-out schemes must be explored. Here, we
propose to encode multiple bits of information in the geometry of subwavelength
dielectric nanostructures. A crucial problem in high-density information
storage concepts is the robustness of the information readout with respect to
fabrication errors and experimental noise. Using a machine-learning based
approach in which the scattering spectra are analyzed by an artificial neural
network, we achieve quasi error free read-out of sequences of up to 9 bit,
encoded in top-down fabricated silicon nanostructures. We demonstrate that
probing few wavelengths instead of the entire spectrum is sufficient for robust
information retrieval and that the readout can be further simplified,
exploiting the RGB values from microscopy images. Our work paves the way
towards high-density optical information storage using planar silicon
nanostructures, compatible with mass-production ready CMOS technology.

1147,"Electric-field Inputs for Molecular Quantum-dot Cellular Automata
  Circuits","  Quantum-dot cellular automata (QCA) is a low-power, non-von-Neumann,
general-purpose paradigm for classical computing using transistor-free logic.
An elementary QCA device called a ""cell"" is made from a system of coupled
quantum dots with a few mobile charges. The cell's charge configuration encodes
a bit, and quantum charge tunneling within a cell enables device switching.
Arrays of cells networked locally via the electrostatic field form QCA
circuits, which mix logic, memory and interconnect. A molecular QCA
implementation promises ultra-high device densities, high switching speeds, and
room-temperature operation. We propose a novel approach to the technical
challenge of transducing bits from larger conventional devices to nanoscale QCA
molecules. This signal transduction begins with lithographically-formed
electrodes placed on the device plane. A voltage applied across these
electrodes establishes an in-plane electric field, which selects a bit packet
on a large QCA input circuit. A typical QCA binary wire may be used to transmit
a smaller bit packet of a size more suitable for processing from this input to
other QCA circuitry. In contrast to previous concepts for bit inputs to
molecular QCA, this approach requires neither special QCA cells with fixed
states nor nanoelectrodes which establish fields with single-electron
specificity. A brief overview of the QCA paradigm is given. Proof-of-principle
simulation results are shown, demonstrating the input concept in circuits made
from two-dot QCA cells. Importantly, this concept for bit inputs to molecular
QCA may enable solutions to or provide insights into other challenges to the
realization of molecular QCA, such as the demonstration of molecular device
switching, the read-out of molecular QCA states, and the layout of molecular
QCA circuits.

1148,Hybrid CMOS-CNFET based NP dynamic Carry Look Ahead Adder,"  Advanced electronic device technologies require a faster operation and
smaller average power consumption, which are the most important parameters in
very large scale integrated circuit design. The conventional Complementary
Metal-Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) technology is limited by the threshold voltage
and subthreshold leakage problems in scaling of devices. This leads to failure
in adapting it to sub-micron and nanotechnologies. The carbon nanotube (CNT)
technology overcomes the threshold voltage and subthreshold leakage problems
despite reduction in size. The CNT based technology develops the most promising
devices among emerging technologies because it has most of the desired
features. Carbon Nanotube Field Effect Transistors (CNFETs) are the novel
devices that are expected to sustain the transistor scalability while
increasing its performance. Recently, there have been tremendous advances in
CNT technology for nanoelectronics applications. CNFETs avoid most of the
fundamental limitations and offer several advantages compared to silicon-based
technology. Though CNT evolves as a better option to overcome some of the bulk
CMOS problems, the CNT itself still immersed with setbacks. The fabrication of
carbon nanotube at very large digital circuits on a single substrate is
difficult to achieve. Therefore, a hybrid NP dynamic Carry Look Ahead Adder
(CLA) is designed using p-CNFET and n-MOS transistors. Here, the performance of
CLA is evaluated in 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit and 64-bit stages with the following
four different implementations: silicon MOSFET (Si-MOSFET) domino logic,
Si-MOSFET NP dynamic CMOS, carbon nanotube MOSFET (CN-MOSFET) domino logic, and
CN-MOSFET NP dynamic CMOS. Finally, a Hybrid CMOS-CNFET based 64-bit NP dynamic
CLA is evaluated based on HSPICE simulation in 32nm technology, which
effectively suppresses power dissipation without an increase in propagation
delay.

1149,"Towards Budget-Driven Hardware Optimization for Deep Convolutional
  Neural Networks using Stochastic Computing","  Recently, Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) has achieved tremendous
success in many machine learning applications. Nevertheless, the deep structure
has brought significant increases in computation complexity. Largescale deep
learning systems mainly operate in high-performance server clusters, thus
restricting the application extensions to personal or mobile devices. Previous
works on GPU and/or FPGA acceleration for DCNNs show increasing speedup, but
ignore other constraints, such as area, power, and energy. Stochastic Computing
(SC), as a unique data representation and processing technique, has the
potential to enable the design of fully parallel and scalable hardware
implementations of large-scale deep learning systems. This paper proposed an
automatic design allocation algorithm driven by budget requirement considering
overall accuracy performance. This systematic method enables the automatic
design of a DCNN where all design parameters are jointly optimized.
Experimental results demonstrate that proposed algorithm can achieve a joint
optimization of all design parameters given the comprehensive budget of a DCNN.
"
1150,Achieving Super-Resolution with Redundant Sensing,"  Analog-to-digital (quantization) and digital-to-analog (de-quantization)
conversion are fundamental operations of many information processing systems.
In practice, the precision of these operations is always bounded, first by the
random mismatch error (ME) occurred during system implementation, and
subsequently by the intrinsic quantization error (QE) determined by the system
architecture itself. In this manuscript, we present a new mathematical
interpretation of the previously proposed redundant sensing (RS) architecture
that not only suppresses ME but also allows achieving an effective resolution
exceeding the system's intrinsic resolution, i.e. super-resolution (SR). SR is
enabled by an endogenous property of redundant structures regarded as ""code
diffusion"" where the references' value spreads into the neighbor sample space
as a result of ME. The proposed concept opens the possibility for a wide range
of applications in low-power fully-integrated sensors and devices where the
cost-accuracy trade-off is inevitable.
"
1151,"A Local Stochastic Algorithm for Separation in Heterogeneous
  Self-Organizing Particle Systems","  We present and rigorously analyze the behavior of a distributed, stochastic
algorithm for separation and integration in self-organizing particle systems,
an abstraction of programmable matter. Such systems are composed of individual
computational particles with limited memory, strictly local communication
abilities, and modest computational power. We consider heterogeneous particle
systems of two different colors and prove that these systems can collectively
separate into different color classes or integrate, indifferent to color. We
accomplish both behaviors with the same fully distributed, local, stochastic
algorithm. Achieving separation or integration depends only on a single global
parameter determining whether particles prefer to be next to other particles of
the same color or not; this parameter is meant to represent external,
environmental influences on the particle system. The algorithm is a
generalization of a previous distributed, stochastic algorithm for compression
(PODC '16), which can be viewed as a special case of separation where all
particles have the same color. It is significantly more challenging to prove
that the desired behavior is achieved in the heterogeneous setting, however,
even in the bichromatic case we focus on. This requires combining several new
techniques, including the cluster expansion from statistical physics, a new
variant of the bridging argument of Miracle, Pascoe and Randall (RANDOM '11),
the high-temperature expansion of the Ising model, and careful probabilistic
arguments.
"
1152,"Low cost quantum circuits for classically intractable instances of the
  Hamiltonian dynamics simulation problem","  We develop circuit implementations for digital-level quantum Hamiltonian
dynamics simulation algorithms suitable for implementation on a reconfigurable
quantum computer, such as trapped ions. Our focus is on the co-design of a
problem, its solution, and quantum hardware capable of executing the solution
at the minimal cost expressed in terms of the quantum computing resources used
while demonstrating the solution of an instance of a scientifically interesting
problem that is intractable classically. The choice for Hamiltonian dynamics
simulation is due to the combination of its usefulness in the study of
equilibrium in closed quantum mechanical systems, a low cost in the
implementation by quantum algorithms, and the difficulty of classical
simulation. By targeting a specific type of quantum computer and tailoring the
problem instance and solution to suit physical constraints imposed by the
hardware, we are able to reduce the resource counts by a factor of $10$ in a
physical-level implementation and a factor of $30$ to $60$ in a fault-tolerant
implementation over state of the art.

1153,Scene-Aware Audio for 360\textdegree{} Videos,"  Although 360\textdegree{} cameras ease the capture of panoramic footage, it
remains challenging to add realistic 360\textdegree{} audio that blends into
the captured scene and is synchronized with the camera motion. We present a
method for adding scene-aware spatial audio to 360\textdegree{} videos in
typical indoor scenes, using only a conventional mono-channel microphone and a
speaker. We observe that the late reverberation of a room's impulse response is
usually diffuse spatially and directionally. Exploiting this fact, we propose a
method that synthesizes the directional impulse response between any source and
listening locations by combining a synthesized early reverberation part and a
measured late reverberation tail. The early reverberation is simulated using a
geometric acoustic simulation and then enhanced using a frequency modulation
method to capture room resonances. The late reverberation is extracted from a
recorded impulse response, with a carefully chosen time duration that separates
out the late reverberation from the early reverberation. In our validations, we
show that our synthesized spatial audio matches closely with recordings using
ambisonic microphones. Lastly, we demonstrate the strength of our method in
several applications.
"
1154,"BioPhysical Modeling, Characterization and Optimization of
  Electro-Quasistatic Human Body Communication","  Human Body Communication (HBC) has emerged as an alternative to radio wave
communication for connecting low power, miniaturized wearable and implantable
devices in, on and around the human body which uses the human body as the
communication channel. Previous studies characterizing the human body channel
has reported widely varying channel response much of which has been attributed
to the variation in measurement setup. This calls for the development of a
unifying bio physical model of HBC supported by in depth analysis and an
understanding of the effect of excitation, termination modality on HBC
measurements. This paper characterizes the human body channel up to 1MHz
frequency to evaluate it as a medium for broadband communication. A lumped bio
physical model of HBC is developed, supported by experimental validations that
provides insight into some of the key discrepancies found in previous studies.
Voltage loss measurements are carried out both with an oscilloscope and a
miniaturized wearable prototype to capture the effects of non common ground.
Results show that the channel loss is strongly dependent on the termination
impedance at the receiver end, with up to 4dB variation in average loss for
different termination in an oscilloscope and an additional 9 dB channel loss
with wearable prototype compared to an oscilloscope measurement. The measured
channel response with capacitive termination reduces low frequency loss and
allows flat band transfer function down to 13 KHz, establishing the human body
as a broadband communication channel. Analysis of the measured results and the
simulation model shows that (1) high impedance (2) capacitive termination
should be used at the receiver end for accurate voltage mode loss measurements
of the HBC channel at low frequencies.
"
1155,"Experimental investigation of performance differences between Coherent
  Ising Machines and a quantum annealer","  Physical annealing systems provide heuristic approaches to solving NP-hard
Ising optimization problems. Here, we study the performance of two types of
annealing machines--a commercially available quantum annealer built by D-Wave
Systems, and measurement-feedback coherent Ising machines (CIMs) based on
optical parametric oscillator networks--on two classes of problems, the
Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) model and MAX-CUT. The D-Wave quantum annealer
outperforms the CIMs on MAX-CUT on regular graphs of degree 3. On denser
problems, however, we observe an exponential penalty for the quantum annealer
($\exp(-\alpha_\textrm{DW} N^2)$) relative to CIMs ($\exp(-\alpha_\textrm{CIM}
N)$) for fixed anneal times, on both the SK model and on 50%-edge-density
MAX-CUT, where the coefficients $\alpha_\textrm{CIM}$ and $\alpha_\textrm{DW}$
are problem-class-dependent. On instances with over $50$ vertices, a
several-orders-of-magnitude time-to-solution difference exists between CIMs and
the D-Wave annealer. An optimal-annealing-time analysis is also consistent with
a significant projected performance difference. The difference in performance
between the sparsely connected D-Wave machine and the measurement-feedback
facilitated all-to-all connectivity of the CIMs provides strong experimental
support for efforts to increase the connectivity of quantum annealers.
"
1156,Transforming graph states using single-qubit operations,"  Stabilizer states form an important class of states in quantum information,
and are of central importance in quantum error correction. Here, we provide an
algorithm for deciding whether one stabilizer (target) state can be obtained
from another stabilizer (source) state by single-qubit Clifford operations
(LC), single-qubit Pauli measurements (LPM), and classical communication (CC)
between sites holding the individual qubits. What's more, we provide a recipe
to obtain the sequence of LC+LPM+CC operations which prepare the desired target
state from the source state, and show how these operations can be applied in
parallel to reach the target state in constant time. Our algorithm has
applications in quantum networks, quantum computing, and can also serve as a
design tool - for example, to find transformations between quantum error
correcting codes. We provide a software implementation of our algorithm that
makes this tool easier to apply.
  A key insight leading to our algorithm is to show that the problem is
equivalent to one in graph theory, which is to decide whether some graph G' is
a vertex-minor of another graph G. Here we show that the vertex-minor problem
can be solved in time O(|G|^3) where |G| is the size of the graph G, whenever
the rank-width of G and the size of G' are bounded. Our algorithm is based on
techniques by Courcelle for solving fixed parameter tractable problems, where
here the relevant fixed parameter is the rank width. The second half of this
paper serves as an accessible but far from exhausting introduction to these
concepts, that could be useful for many other problems in quantum information.
"
1157,"How to transform graph states using single-qubit operations:
  computational complexity and algorithms","  Graph states are ubiquitous in quantum information with diverse applications
ranging from quantum network protocols to measurement based quantum computing.
Here we consider the question whether one graph (source) state can be
transformed into another graph (target) state, using a specific set of quantum
operations (LC+LPM+CC): single-qubit Clifford operations (LC), single-qubit
Pauli measurements (LPM) and classical communication (CC) between sites holding
the individual qubits. We first show that deciding whether a graph state |G>
can be transformed into another graph state |G'> using LC+LPM+CC is
NP-Complete, even if |G'> is restricted to be the GHZ-state. However, we also
provide efficient algorithms for two situations of practical interest:
  1. |G> has Schmidt-rank width one and |G'> is a GHZ-state. The Schmidt-rank
width is an entanglement measure of quantum states, meaning this algorithm is
efficient if the original state has little entanglement. Our algorithm has
runtime O(|V(G')||V(G)|^3), and is also efficient in practice even on small
instances as further showcased by a freely available software implementation.
  2. |G> is in a certain class of states with unbounded Schmidt-rank width, and
|G'> is a GHZ-state of a constant size. Here the runtime is O(poly(|V(G)|)),
showing that more efficient algorithms can in principle be found even for
states holding a large amount of entanglement, as long as the output state has
constant size.
  Our results make use of the insight that deciding whether a graph state |G>
can be transformed to another graph state |G'> is equivalent to a known
decision problem in graph theory, namely the problem of deciding whether a
graph G' is a vertex-minor of a graph G. Many of the technical tools developed
to obtain our results may be of independent interest.
"
1158,Convex Hull Formation for Programmable Matter,"  We envision programmable matter as a system of nano-scale agents (called
particles) with very limited computational capabilities that move and compute
collectively to achieve a desired goal. We use the geometric amoebot model as
our computational framework, which assumes particles move on the triangular
lattice. Motivated by the problem of sealing an object using minimal resources,
we show how a particle system can self-organize to form an object's convex
hull. We give a distributed, local algorithm for convex hull formation and
prove that it runs in $\mathcal{O}(B)$ asynchronous rounds, where $B$ is the
length of the object's boundary. Within the same asymptotic runtime, this
algorithm can be extended to also form the object's (weak) $\mathcal{O}$-hull,
which uses the same number of particles but minimizes the area enclosed by the
hull. Our algorithms are the first to compute convex hulls with distributed
entities that have strictly local sensing, constant-size memory, and no shared
sense of orientation or coordinates. Ours is also the first distributed
approach to computing restricted-orientation convex hulls. This approach
involves coordinating particles as distributed memory; thus, as a supporting
but independent result, we present and analyze an algorithm for organizing
particles with constant-size memory as distributed binary counters that
efficiently support increments, decrements, and zero-tests --- even as the
particles move.

1159,"From Stochastic to Bit Stream Computing: Accurate Implementation of
  Arithmetic Circuits and Applications in Neural Networks","  In this study, we propose a novel computing paradigm ""Bit Stream Computing""
that is constructed on the logic used in stochastic computing, but does not
necessarily employ randomly or Binomially distributed bit streams as stochastic
computing does. Any type of streams can be used either stochastic or
deterministic. The proposed paradigm benefits from the area advantage of
stochastic logic and the accuracy advantage of conventional binary logic. We
implement accurate arithmetic multiplier and adder circuits, classified as
asynchronous or synchronous; we also consider their suitability of processing
successive streams. The proposed circuits are simulated both in gate level and
in transistor level with AMS 0.35um CMOS technology to show the circuits'
potential for practical use. We thoroughly compare the proposed adders and
multipliers with their predecessors in the literature, individually and in a
neural network application. Comparisons made in terms of area and accuracy
clearly favor the proposed designs. We believe that this study opens up new
horizons for computing that enables us to implement much smaller yet accurate
arithmetic circuits compared to the conventional binary and stochastic ones.

1160,"Implementation of True Random Number Generator based on Double-Scroll
  Attractor circuit with GST memristor emulator","  The cryptographic security provided by various techniques of random number
generator (RNG) construction is one of the developing researches areas today.
Among various types of RNG, the true random bit generator (TRBG) can be
considered as the most unpredictable and most secured because its randomness
seed is generated from chaotic sources. This paper proposes a design of TRBG
model based on double-scroll attractors circuits with GST memristor. After
implementation and simulation of the chaotic circuit with GST memristor
emulator, the chaotic behavior of the output voltage and inductor current were
received. Moreover, their dependence on the input voltage revealed the close to
double-scroll form. The randomness generated from the proposed circuit was
tested by receiving Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and Lyapunov exponents of the
output voltage.

1161,Analysis of Noise in Current Mirrors with memristive Device,"  This work presents an analysis of noise in a cascode current mirror with
CMOS-memristive device done by comparison with the basic current mirror. The
analysis is completed based on THD for different frequency and channel length
values by means of computer-aided design. AC and DC analyses are presented for
both balanced and unbalanced current mirrors. While the change in the channel
length has similar effect in both circuits, memristor in a circuit decreases
noise significantly at high frequencies.

1162,Widlar Current Mirror Design Using BJT-Memristor Circuits,"  This paper presents a description of basic current mirror (CM), Widlar
current mirror, fourth circuit element (memristor) and an analysis of Widlar
Configuration with integrated memristor. The analysis has been performed by
comparing a modified configuration with a simple circuit of Widlar CM. The
focus of analysis were a power dissipation, a Total Harmonic Distortion and a
chip-surface. The results has shown that a presence of memristor in the Widlar
CM decreases the chip-surface area and the deviation of the signal in the
circuit from a fundamental frequency. Although the analysis of power
dissipation has also been conducted, there is no definite conclusion about the
power losses in the circuit because of the memristor model.
"
1163,"Realizing Wireless Communication through Software-defined HyperSurface
  Environments","  Wireless communication environments are unaware of the ongoing data exchange
efforts within them. Moreover, their effect on the communication quality is
intractable in all but the simplest cases. The present work proposes a new
paradigm, where indoor scattering becomes software-defined and, subsequently,
optimizable across wide frequency ranges. Moreover, the controlled scattering
can surpass natural behavior, exemplary overriding Snell's law, reflecting
waves towards any custom angle (including negative ones). Thus, path loss and
multi-path fading effects can be controlled and mitigated. The core technology
of this new paradigm are metasurfaces, planar artificial structures whose
effect on impinging electromagnetic waves is fully defined by their
macro-structure. The present study contributes the software-programmable
wireless environment model, consisting of several HyperSurface tiles controlled
by a central, environment configuration server. HyperSurfaces are a novel class
of metasurfaces whose structure and, hence, electromagnetic behavior can be
altered and controlled via a software interface. Multiple networked tiles coat
indoor objects, allowing fine-grained, customizable reflection, absorption or
polarization overall. A central server calculates and deploys the optimal
electromagnetic interaction per tile, to the benefit of communicating devices.
Realistic simulations using full 3D ray-tracing demonstrate the groundbreaking
potential of the proposed approach in 2.4 GHz and 60 GHz frequencies.

crossbar arrays are used as the architecture for proposed MF analog circuit.
The main advantages of the memristive crossbar circuit are size, energy
efficiency and fault tolerance compared to another analog alternatives. The
conducted crossbar SPICE simulation with MS model of the memristor results
confirm the performance and highlighted benefits of the proposed circuit.

1165,"Instrumentation Amplifier design: Comparison of CMOS-memristive to CMOS
  design","  An instrumentation amplifier (InAmp) is an electronic device used in many
applications, where test and measuring accuracy is required. However, one of
the drawbacks of an InAmp is limited operation gain range. In this paper, we
investigate the possibility of replacing CMOS transistors in InAmp with
memristive devices. The application of memristors in CMOS instrumentation
amplifier design has lead to reduction of on-chip area and power consumption,
comparing to the original design. The memristor based implementation of InAmp
design has an improved gain. The advantages of memristor application are shown,
and DC and operation gain range are discussed in this paper. Furthermore,
variability analysis and performance variation with respect to the temperature
variation is provided. In addition, the noise sensitivity analysis is
performed. Moreover, varying values of resistance levels of memristors, the
operation gain range, gain accuracy as well as a the noise reduction can be
improved.

1166,Sense amplifier design using CMOS-memristor circuits,"  With the increase of the speed of computers, timing and power requirements
are becoming crucial for memory devices. The main objective of the paper is to
modify 180nm CMOS sense amplifier design by using memristive devices and
improve the design in terms of on-chip area, power efficiency, resistance to
temperatures and speed. To achieve this, NOT gates in the circuit were
constructed using memristor and CMOS. The main aim of the paper is to check the
effect of memristors on characteristics of sense amplifier. The design was
tested on Conventional Current Sense Amplifier (CSA) circuit. Changes in power,
area, sensing delay and offset are reported in the paper.
"
1167,Perceptron Linear Function Design with CMOS-Memristive Circuits,"  In the last decade, the interest to emulation of the functionality and
structure of the human brain to solve the problems related to image processing
and pattern recognition, especially using to Artificial Neural Network (ANN),
has increased. Since the capability of ANN to compute at high-speed has been
proven to be very useful for various computational problems. One of the simple
ANN models is perceptron. Since the perceptron is the basic form of a neural
network, the efficient implementation of analog activation functions is
required. As various works introduce the design of sigmoid and tangent
activation functions, the other activation functions remain an open research
problem. This paper describes the design of the perception circuit with the
linear activation function using operational amplifier and memristive crossbar.
Additionally, the variation of performance with temperature, noise of the
circuit is presented.
"
1168,Variability analysis of Memristor-based Sigmoid Function,"  Activation functions are widely used in neural networks to decide the
activation value of the neural unit based upon linear combinations of the
weighted inputs. The effective implementation of activation function is highly
important, as they help to represent non-linear complex functional mappings
between inputs and outputs of the neural network. One of the non-linear
approaches is to use a sigmoid function. Therefore, there is a growing need in
enhancing the performance of sigmoid circuits. In this paper, the main
objective is to modify existing current mirror based sigmoid model by replacing
CMOS transistors with memristor devices. This model was tested varying
different circuit parameters, transistor size and temperature. The the area,
power and noise in the modified CMOS-memristive sigmoid circuit are shown. The
application of memristors in the sigmoid circuit results in higher component
density in an on-chip area, allowing a reduction of power and area by 7$\%$.
The proposed sigmoid circuit was simulated in SPICE using 180nm TSMC CMOS
technology.
"
1169,Analog multiplier design with CMOS-memristor circuits,"  CMOS-transistors circuits have been used as a conventional approach for
designing an analog multiplier in modern era of industrial electronics.
However, previous studies have shown, that based on the working region of
transistors, such as saturation or weak inversion regions, the circuit may face
issues with output ranges and accuracy. One possible solution to that problem
could be choosing CMOS-memristors as a basis for the circuit. Although
memristor research is still a growing and promising field, one could argue that
its implementation could bring many benefits such as increased circuit density
and superior computation speeds, etc. Additionally, the era of Moore's Law of
downscaling the size of transistors is to eventually come to an end. No one
knows whether the end of a scaling paradigm is to happen within the next five
or twenty years. Hence, the research on this particular subject is quite
important. This paper proposes an analog multiplier design with CMOS and
memristive components. Mainly, the aim of the paper is to compare the power
consumption and overall characteristic of the multiplier such as the accuracy
and the output range to that of the conventional multiplier. The designed
circuit is expected to be suitable for low power applications, and it is built
using 18um CMOS technology. The circuit simulations will be conducted using
SPICE software. Finally, the effects of channel modulation and temperature on
the multiplier performance will be discussed.

circuits based on memristive crossbar has been intensively explored in recent
years. The implementation of various activation functions is important,
especially for deep leaning neural networks. There are several implementations
of sigmoid and tangent activation function, while the implementation of the
neural networks with linear activation functions is an open problem. Therefore,
this paper introduces a multilayer perceptron design with linear activation

1171,CMOS-Memristive Analog Multiplier Design,"  This paper proposes four quadrant analog multiplier using CMOS-memristor
circuit. Currently, there are plenty of analog multipliers using resistors and
CMOS transistors. They can attain perfect multiplication but have several
disadvantages such as lower processing speed, higher power consumption and
larger chip areas. Memristor based circuits are introduced to resolve the
mentioned drawbacks. In this paper current mode four quadrant multiplier based
on squaring circuits is taken as a framework, and CMOS transistors are replaced
with memristors. The circuit design is simulated with SPICE, and variability
analysis and performance variation with temperature is performed. The proposed
circuit allows faster processing with retained data while dissipating less
power retaining the multiplication characteristics.

1172,"Effects of Memristors on Fully Differential Transimpedance Amplifier
  Performance","  The progress of the Internet of Things(IoT) technologies and applications
requires the efficient low power circuits and architectures to maintain and
improve the performance of the increasingly growing data processing systems.
Memristive circuits and substitution of energy-consuming devices with
memristors is a promising solution to reduce on-chip area and power dissipation
of the architectures. In this paper, we proposed a CMOS-memristive fully
differential transimpedance amplifier and assess the impact of memristors on
the amplifier performance. The fully differential amplifiers were simulated
using 180nm CMOS technology and have 5.3-23MHz bandwidths and 2.3-5.7k$\Omega$
transimpedance gains with a 1pF load. We compare the memristor based amplifier
with conventional architecture. The gain, frequency response, linear range,
power consumption, area, total harmonic distortion and performance variations
with temperature are reported.

1173,Implementation of Chua's chaotic oscillator with an HP memristor,"  This paper proposes an innovative chaotic circuit based on Chua's oscillator.
It combines traditional realization of a non-linear resistor in Chua's chaotic
oscillator with a promising memristive circuitry. This mixed implementation
connects old research works that were focused on diodes with relatively new
research papers that are, now, concentrated on memristors. As a result, more
reliable chaotic circuit with an HP memristor is obtained that could be used as
a source of randomness. Dynamic behavior of the circuit is studied by obtaining
fft analysis, different chaotic attractors and Lyapunov exponent spectrum. The
results show that the addition of a memristor enhances chaotic behavior of the
circuit while maintaining the same power dissipation.
"
1174,Perspectives of Using Oscillators for Computing and Signal Processing,"  It is an intriguing concept to use oscillators as fundamental building blocks
of electronic computers. The idea is not new, but is currently subject to
intense research as a part of the quest for 'beyond Moore' electronic devices.
In this paper we give an engineering-minded survey of oscillator-based
computing architectures, with the goal of understanding their promise and
limitations for next-generation computing. We will mostly discuss non-Boolean,
neurally-inspired computing concepts and put the emphasis on hardware and on
circuits where the oscillators are realized from emerging, nanoscale building
blocks. Despite all the promise that oscillatory computing holds, existing
literature gives very few clear-cut arguments about the possible benefits of
using oscillators in place of other analog nonlinear circuit elements. In this
survey we will argue for finding the rationale of using oscillatory building
blocks and call for benchmarking studies that compare oscillatory computing
circuits to level-based (analog) implementations.

1175,A Case for Variability-Aware Policies for NISQ-Era Quantum Computers,"  Recently, IBM, Google, and Intel showcased quantum computers ranging from 49
to 72 qubits. While these systems represent a significant milestone in the
advancement of quantum computing, existing and near-term quantum computers are
not yet large enough to fully support quantum error-correction. Such systems
with few tens to few hundreds of qubits are termed as Noisy Intermediate Scale
Quantum computers (NISQ), and these systems can provide benefits for a class of
quantum algorithms. In this paper, we study the problems of Qubit-Allocation
(mapping of program qubits to machine qubits) and Qubit-Movement(routing qubits
from one location to another to perform entanglement).
  We observe that there exists variation in the error rates of different qubits
and links, which can have an impact on the decisions for qubit movement and
qubit allocation. We analyze characterization data for the IBM-Q20 quantum
computer gathered over 52 days to understand and quantify the variation in the
error-rates and find that there is indeed significant variability in the error
rates of the qubits and the links connecting them. We define reliability
metrics for NISQ computers and show that the device variability has the
substantial impact on the overall system reliability. To exploit the
variability in error rate, we propose Variation-Aware Qubit Movement (VQM) and
Variation-Aware Qubit Allocation (VQA), policies that optimize the movement and
allocation of qubits to avoid the weaker qubits and links and guide more
operations towards the stronger qubits and links. We show that our
Variation-Aware policies improve the reliability of the NISQ system up to 2.5x.

1176,Long short-term memory networks in memristor crossbars,"  Recent breakthroughs in recurrent deep neural networks with long short-term
memory (LSTM) units has led to major advances in artificial intelligence.
State-of-the-art LSTM models with significantly increased complexity and a
large number of parameters, however, have a bottleneck in computing power
resulting from limited memory capacity and data communication bandwidth. Here
we demonstrate experimentally that LSTM can be implemented with a memristor
crossbar, which has a small circuit footprint to store a large number of
parameters and in-memory computing capability that circumvents the 'von Neumann
bottleneck'. We illustrate the capability of our system by solving real-world
problems in regression and classification, which shows that memristor LSTM is a
promising low-power and low-latency hardware platform for edge inference.
"
1177,Optimizing Quantum Circuits for Arithmetic,"  Many quantum algorithms make use of oracles which evaluate classical
functions on a superposition of inputs. In order to facilitate implementation,
testing, and resource estimation of such algorithms, we present quantum
circuits for evaluating functions that are often encountered in the quantum
algorithm literature. This includes Gaussians, hyperbolic tangent, sine/cosine,
inverse square root, arcsine, and exponentials. We use insights from classical
high-performance computing in order to optimize our circuits and implement a
quantum software stack module which allows to automatically generate circuits
for evaluating piecewise smooth functions in the computational basis. Our
circuits enable more detailed cost analyses of various quantum algorithms,
allowing to identify concrete applications of future quantum computing devices.
Furthermore, our resource estimates may guide future research aiming to reduce
the costs or even the need for arithmetic in the computational basis
altogether.
"
1178,Resonate and Fire Neuron with Fixed Magnetic Skyrmions,"  In the brain, the membrane potential of many neurons oscillates in a
subthreshold damped fashion and fire when excited by an input frequency that
nearly equals their eigen frequency. In this work, we investigate theoretically
the artificial implementation of such ""resonate-and-fire"" neurons by utilizing
the magnetization dynamics of a fixed magnetic skyrmion in the free layer of a
magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ). To realize firing of this nanomagnetic
implementation of an artificial neuron, we propose to employ voltage control of
magnetic anisotropy or voltage generated strain as an input (spike or
sinusoidal) signal, which modulates the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy
(PMA). This results in continual expansion and shrinking (i.e. breathing) of a
skyrmion core that mimics the subthreshold oscillation. Any subsequent input
pulse having an interval close to the breathing period or a sinusoidal input
close to the eigen frequency drives the magnetization dynamics of the fixed
skyrmion in a resonant manner. The time varying electrical resistance of the
MTJ layer due to this resonant oscillation of the skyrmion core is used to
drive a Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) buffer circuit, which
produces spike outputs. By rigorous micromagnetic simulation, we investigate
the interspike timing dependence and response to different excitatory and
inhibitory incoming input pulses. Finally, we show that such resonate and fire
neurons have potential application in coupled nanomagnetic oscillator based
associative memory arrays.
"
1179,Training LSTM Networks with Resistive Cross-Point Devices,"  In our previous work we have shown that resistive cross point devices, so
called Resistive Processing Unit (RPU) devices, can provide significant power
and speed benefits when training deep fully connected networks as well as
convolutional neural networks. In this work, we further extend the RPU concept
for training recurrent neural networks (RNNs) namely LSTMs. We show that the
mapping of recurrent layers is very similar to the mapping of fully connected
layers and therefore the RPU concept can potentially provide large acceleration
factors for RNNs as well. In addition, we study the effect of various device
imperfections and system parameters on training performance. Symmetry of
updates becomes even more crucial for RNNs; already a few percent asymmetry
results in an increase in the test error compared to the ideal case trained
with floating point numbers. Furthermore, the input signal resolution to device
arrays needs to be at least 7 bits for successful training. However, we show
that a stochastic rounding scheme can reduce the input signal resolution back
to 5 bits. Further, we find that RPU device variations and hardware noise are
enough to mitigate overfitting, so that there is less need for using dropout.
We note that the models trained here are roughly 1500 times larger than the
fully connected network trained on MNIST dataset in terms of the total number
of multiplication and summation operations performed per epoch. Thus, here we
attempt to study the validity of the RPU approach for large scale networks.

1180,"Miniaturized Microwave Devices and Antennas for Wearable, Implantable
  and Wireless Applications","  This thesis presents a number of microwave devices and antennas that maintain
high operational efficiency and are compact in size at the same time. One goal
of this thesis is to address several miniaturization challenges of antennas and
microwave components by using the theoretical principles of metamaterials,
Metasurface coupling resonators and stacked radiators, in combination with the
elementary antenna and transmission line theory. While innovating novel
solutions, standards and specifications of next generation wireless and
bio-medical applications were considered to ensure advancement in the
respective scientific fields. Compact reconfigurable phase-shifter and a
microwave cross-over based on negative-refractive-index transmission-line
(NRI-TL) materialist unit cells is presented. A Metasurface based wearable
sensor architecture is proposed, containing an electromagnetic band-gap (EBG)
structure backed monopole antenna for off-body communication and a fork shaped
antenna for efficient radiation towards the human body. A fully parametrized
solution for an implantable antenna is proposed using metallic coated stacked
substrate layers. Challenges and possible solutions for off-body, on-body,
through-body and across-body communication have been investigated with an aid
of computationally extensive simulations and experimental verification. Next,
miniaturization and implementation of a UWB antenna along with an analytical
model to predict the resonance is presented. Lastly, several miniaturized
rectifiers designed specifically for efficient wireless power transfer are
proposed, experimentally verified, and discussed. The study answered several
research questions of applied electromagnetic in the field of bio-medicine and
wireless communication.
"
1181,"Overcoming device unreliability with continuous learning in a population
  coding based computing system","  The brain, which uses redundancy and continuous learning to overcome the
unreliability of its components, provides a promising path to building
computing systems that are robust to the unreliability of their constituent
nanodevices. In this work, we illustrate this path by a computing system based
on population coding with magnetic tunnel junctions that implement both neurons
and synaptic weights. We show that equipping such a system with continuous
learning enables it to recover from the loss of neurons and makes it possible
to use unreliable synaptic weights (i.e. low energy barrier magnetic memories).
There is a tradeoff between power consumption and precision because low energy
barrier memories consume less energy than high barrier ones. For a given
precision, there is an optimal number of neurons and an optimal energy barrier
for the weights that leads to minimum power consumption.
"
1182,"Synthesis methods for reversible circuits consisting of NOT, CNOT and
  2-CNOT gates (Ph.D. thesis)","  In this paper, reversible circuits consisting of NOT, CNOT and 2-CNOT gates
are studied. Several asymptotically optimal by the order of magnitude synthesis
methods are described. Some circuit's complexity reduction approaches are
considered. Implementation of discrete logarithm within a reversible circuit is
discussed. The main conclusion in the paper is that the usage of additional
inputs (additional memory) in reversible circuits almost always allow to reduce
their complexity, depth and weight.
"
1183,"Advancing Hardware Security Using Polymorphic and Stochastic Spin-Hall
  Effect Devices","  Protecting intellectual property (IP) in electronic circuits has become a
serious challenge in recent years. Logic locking/encryption and layout
camouflaging are two prominent techniques for IP protection. Most existing
approaches, however, particularly those focused on CMOS integration, incur
excessive design overheads resulting from their need for additional circuit
structures or device-level modifications. This work leverages the innate
polymorphism of an emerging spin-based device, called the giant spin-Hall
effect (GSHE) switch, to simultaneously enable locking and camouflaging within
a single instance. Using the GSHE switch, we propose a powerful primitive that
enables cloaking all the 16 Boolean functions possible for two inputs. We
conduct a comprehensive study using state-of-the-art Boolean satisfiability
(SAT) attacks to demonstrate the superior resilience of the proposed primitive
in comparison to several others in the literature. While we tailor the
primitive for deterministic computation, it can readily support stochastic
computation; we argue that stochastic behavior can break most, if not all,
existing SAT attacks. Finally, we discuss the resilience of the primitive
against various side-channel attacks as well as invasive monitoring at runtime,
which are arguably even more concerning threats than SAT attacks.
"
1184,"A Memristor based Unsupervised Neuromorphic System Towards Fast and
  Energy-Efficient GAN","  Deep Learning has gained immense success in pushing today's artificial
intelligence forward. To solve the challenge of limited labeled data in the
supervised learning world, unsupervised learning has been proposed years ago
while low accuracy hinters its realistic applications. Generative adversarial
network (GAN) emerges as an unsupervised learning approach with promising
accuracy and are under extensively study. However, the execution of GAN is
extremely memory and computation intensive and results in ultra-low speed and
high-power consumption. In this work, we proposed a holistic solution for fast
and energy-efficient GAN computation through a memristor-based neuromorphic
system. First, we exploited a hardware and software co-design approach to map
the computation blocks in GAN efficiently. We also proposed an efficient data
flow for optimal parallelism training and testing, depending on the computation
correlations between different computing blocks. To compute the unique and
complex loss of GAN, we developed a diff-block with optimized accuracy and
performance. The experiment results on big data show that our design achieves
2.8x speedup and 6.1x energy-saving compared with the traditional GPU
accelerator, as well as 5.5x speedup and 1.4x energy-saving compared with the
previous FPGA-based accelerator.
"
1185,"A New Wireless Communication Paradigm through Software-controlled
  Metasurfaces","  Electromagnetic waves undergo multiple uncontrollable alterations as they
propagate within a wireless environment. Free space path loss, signal
absorption, as well as reflections, refractions and diffractions caused by
physical objects within the environment highly affect the performance of
wireless communications. Currently, such effects are intractable to account for
and are treated as probabilistic factors. The paper proposes a radically
different approach, enabling deterministic, programmable control over the
behavior of the wireless environments. The key-enabler is the so-called
HyperSurface tile, a novel class of planar meta-materials which can interact
with impinging electromagnetic waves in a controlled manner. The HyperSurface
tiles can effectively re-engineer electromagnetic waves, including steering
towards any desired direction, full absorption, polarization manipulation and
more. Multiple tiles are employed to coat objects such as walls, furniture,
overall, any objects in the indoor and outdoor environments. An external
software service calculates and deploys the optimal interaction types per tile,
to best fit the needs of communicating devices. Evaluation via simulations
highlights the potential of the new concept.
"
1186,"Quantum singular value transformation and beyond: exponential
  improvements for quantum matrix arithmetics","  Quantum computing is powerful because unitary operators describing the
time-evolution of a quantum system have exponential size in terms of the number
of qubits present in the system. We develop a new ""Singular value
transformation"" algorithm capable of harnessing this exponential advantage,
that can apply polynomial transformations to the singular values of a block of
a unitary, generalizing the optimal Hamiltonian simulation results of Low and
Chuang. The proposed quantum circuits have a very simple structure, often give
rise to optimal algorithms and have appealing constant factors, while usually
only use a constant number of ancilla qubits. We show that singular value
transformation leads to novel algorithms. We give an efficient solution to a
certain ""non-commutative"" measurement problem and propose a new method for
singular value estimation. We also show how to exponentially improve the
complexity of implementing fractional queries to unitaries with a gapped
spectrum. Finally, as a quantum machine learning application we show how to
efficiently implement principal component regression. ""Singular value
transformation"" is conceptually simple and efficient, and leads to a unified
framework of quantum algorithms incorporating a variety of quantum speed-ups.
We illustrate this by showing how it generalizes a number of prominent quantum
algorithms, including: optimal Hamiltonian simulation, implementing the
Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse with exponential precision, fixed-point amplitude
amplification, robust oblivious amplitude amplification, fast QMA
amplification, fast quantum OR lemma, certain quantum walk results and several
quantum machine learning algorithms. In order to exploit the strengths of the
presented method it is useful to know its limitations too, therefore we also
prove a lower bound on the efficiency of singular value transformation, which
often gives optimal bounds.
"
1187,Advantages of a modular high-level quantum programming framework,"  We review some of the features of the ProjectQ software framework and
quantify their impact on the resulting circuits. The concise high-level
language facilitates implementing even complex algorithms in a very
time-efficient manner while, at the same time, providing the compiler with
additional information for optimization through code annotation - so-called
meta-instructions. We investigate the impact of these annotations for the
example of Shor's algorithm in terms of logical gate counts. Furthermore, we
analyze the effect of different intermediate gate sets for optimization and how
the dimensions of the resulting circuit depend on a smart choice thereof.
Finally, we demonstrate the benefits of a modular compilation framework by
implementing mapping procedures for one- and two-dimensional nearest neighbor
architectures which we then compare in terms of overhead for different problem
sizes.
"
1188,"Design of Voltage Pulse Control Module for Free Space
  Measurement-Device-Independent Quantum Key Distribution","  Measurement-Device-Independent Quantum Key Distribution (MDIQKD) protocol has
been proved that it is unaffected by all hacking attacks, and ensures the
security of information theory even when the performance of single-photon
detectors is not ideal. Fiber channel has been used by the previous MDIQKD
experimental device. However, the signal attenuation increases exponentially as
the transmission distance increases. In order to overcome this, we regard free
space as the channel of signal transmission, and the signal attenuation
increases square as the transmission distance increases (regardless of the
atmospheric scattering), which can effectively reduce the signal attenuation
trend. In order to implement the free space MDIQKD experiments, a modulation
module is needed to modulate the wide pulse chopping, decoy-state,
normalization, phase encoding and time encoding. In this paper, we present the
design of the Voltage Pulse Control Module for the free space MDIQKD.
"
1189,Design of CMOS-memristor Circuits for LSTM architecture,"  Long Short-Term memory (LSTM) architecture is a well-known approach for
building recurrent neural networks (RNN) useful in sequential processing of
data in application to natural language processing. The near-sensor hardware
implementation of LSTM is challenged due to large parallelism and complexity.
We propose a 0.18 m CMOS, GST memristor LSTM hardware architecture for
near-sensor processing. The proposed system is validated in a forecasting
problem based on Keras model.
"
1190,"A Model of an Oscillatory Neural Network with Multilevel Neurons for
  Pattern Recognition and Computing","  The current study uses a novel method of multilevel neurons and high order
synchronization effects described by a family of special metrics, for pattern
recognition in an oscillatory neural network (ONN). The output oscillator
(neuron) of the network has multilevel variations in its synchronization value
with the reference oscillator, and allows classification of an input pattern
into a set of classes. The ONN model is implemented on thermally-coupled
vanadium dioxide oscillators. The ONN is trained by the simulated annealing
algorithm for selection of the network parameters. The results demonstrate that
ONN is capable of classifying 512 visual patterns (as a cell array 3 * 3,
distributed by symmetry into 102 classes) into a set of classes with a maximum
number of elements up to fourteen. The classification capability of the network
depends on the interior noise level and synchronization effectiveness
parameter. The model allows for designing multilevel output cascades of neural
networks with high net data throughput. The presented method can be applied in
ONNs with various coupling mechanisms and oscillator topology.
"
1191,"When and where do feed-forward neural networks learn localist
  representations?","  According to parallel distributed processing (PDP) theory in psychology,
neural networks (NN) learn distributed rather than interpretable localist
representations. This view has been held so strongly that few researchers have
analysed single units to determine if this assumption is correct. However,
recent results from psychology, neuroscience and computer science have shown
the occasional existence of local codes emerging in artificial and biological
neural networks. In this paper, we undertake the first systematic survey of
when local codes emerge in a feed-forward neural network, using generated input
and output data with known qualities. We find that the number of local codes
that emerge from a NN follows a well-defined distribution across the number of
hidden layer neurons, with a peak determined by the size of input data, number
of examples presented and the sparsity of input data. Using a 1-hot output code
drastically decreases the number of local codes on the hidden layer. The number
of emergent local codes increases with the percentage of dropout applied to the
hidden layer, suggesting that the localist encoding may offer a resilience to
noisy networks. This data suggests that localist coding can emerge from
feed-forward PDP networks and suggests some of the conditions that may lead to
interpretable localist representations in the cortex. The findings highlight
how local codes should not be dismissed out of hand.
"
1192,"Reversibility in space, time, and computation: the case of underwater
  acoustic communications","  Time reversal of waves has been successfully used in communications, sensing
and imaging for decades. The application in underwater acoustic communications
is of our special interest, as it puts together a reversible process (allowing
a reversible software or hardware realisation) and a reversible medium
(allowing a reversible model of the environment). This work in progress report
addresses the issues of modelling, analysis and implementation of acoustic time
reversal from the reversible computation perspective. We show the potential of
using reversible cellular automata for modelling and quantification of
reversibility in the time reversal communication process. Then we present an
implementation of time reversal hardware based on reversible circuits.
"
1193,Using any Surface to Realize a New Paradigm for Wireless Communications,"  This article introduces an approach that could tame wireless channels, making
their behavior deterministic and software-defined. We investigate the novel
idea of HyperSurfaces, which are software-controlled metamaterials embedded in
any surface in the environment. HyperSurfaces are materials that interact with
electromagnetic waves in a fully software-defined fashion, even unnaturally.
Coating walls, doors, furniture and other objects with HyperSurfaces
constitutes the overall behavior of an indoor wireless environment
programmable. Thus, the electromagnetic behavior of the environment as a whole
can be controlled and tailored to the needs of mobile devices within it.
"
1194,"Neuromorphic Time-Dependent Pattern Classification with Organic
  Electrochemical Transistor Arrays","  Based on bottom-up assembly of highly variable neural cells units, the
nervous system can reach unequalled level of performances with respect to
standard materials and devices used in microelectronic. Reproducing these basic
concepts in hardware could potentially revolutionize materials and device
engineering which are used for information processing. Here, we present an
innovative approach that relies on both iono-electronic materials and intrinsic
device physics to show pattern classification out of a 12-unit bio-sensing
array. We use the reservoir computing and learning concept to demonstrate
relevant computing based on the ionic dynamics in 400-nm channel-length organic
electrochemical transistor (OECT). We show that this approach copes efficiently
with the high level of variability obtained by bottom-up fabrication using a
new electropolymerizable polymer, which enables iono-electronic device
functionality and material stability in the electrolyte. We investigate the
effect of the array size and variability on the performances for a real-time
classification task paving the way to new embedded sensing and processing
approaches.
"
1195,"Exploiting Inherent Error-Resiliency of Neuromorphic Computing to
  achieve Extreme Energy-Efficiency through Mixed-Signal Neurons","  Neuromorphic computing, inspired by the brain, promises extreme efficiency
for certain classes of learning tasks, such as classification and pattern
recognition. The performance and power consumption of neuromorphic computing
depends heavily on the choice of the neuron architecture. Digital neurons
(Dig-N) are conventionally known to be accurate and efficient at high speed,
while suffering from high leakage currents from a large number of transistors
in a large design. On the other hand, analog/mixed-signal neurons are prone to
noise, variability and mismatch, but can lead to extremely low-power designs.
In this work, we will analyze, compare and contrast existing neuron
architectures with a proposed mixed-signal neuron (MS-N) in terms of
performance, power and noise, thereby demonstrating the applicability of the
proposed mixed-signal neuron for achieving extreme energy-efficiency in
neuromorphic computing. The proposed MS-N is implemented in 65 nm CMOS
technology and exhibits > 100X better energy-efficiency across all frequencies
over two traditional digital neurons synthesized in the same technology node.
We also demonstrate that the inherent error-resiliency of a fully connected or
even convolutional neural network (CNN) can handle the noise as well as the
manufacturing non-idealities of the MS-N up to certain degrees. Notably, a
system-level implementation on MNIST datasets exhibits a worst-case increase in
classification error by 2.1% when the integrated noise power in the bandwidth
is ~ 0.1 uV2, along with +-3{\sigma} amount of variation and mismatch
introduced in the transistor parameters for the proposed neuron with 8-bit
precision.
"
1196,Capacitor Based Activity Sensing for Kinetic Powered Wearable IoTs,"  We propose a novel use of the conventional energy storage component, i.e.,
capacitor, in kinetic-powered wearable IoTs as a sensor to detect human
activities. Since different activities accumulate energies in the capacitor at
different rates, these activities can be detected directly by observing the
charging rate of the capacitor. The key advantage of the proposed capacitor
based activity sensing mechanism, called CapSense, is that it obviates the need
for sampling the motion signal during the activity detection period thus
significantly saving power consumption of the wearable device. A challenge we
face is that capacitors are inherently non-linear energy accumulators, which,
even for the same activity, leads to significant variations in charging rates
at different times depending on the current charge level of the capacitor. We
solve this problem by jointly configuring the parameters of the capacitor and
the associated energy harvesting circuits, which allows us to operate on
charging cycles that are approximately linear. We design and implement a
kinetic-powered shoe sole and conduct experiments with 10 subjects. Our results
show that CapSense can classify five different daily activities with 95%
accuracy while consuming 73% less system power compared to conventional motion
signal based activity detection.
"
1197,Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction in liquid marbles,"  This paper reports on a new method of encapsulating BZ solution droplets in a
powder coating of either polyethylene (PE) or polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE),
to produce BZ liquid marbles (LMs). The BZ LMs have solid--liquid interfaces in
contrast to the previously reported BZ encapsulation systems used to study
pattern formations and wave transfers, such as BZ emulsions and BZ vesicles.
All these systems are important to study as they can be seen as analogues for
information transfer in excitable systems in nature. Due to the powder coating
of the LMs, LMs do not wet the underlying substrate, making the LMs mobile,
enabling them to be easily arranged in arrays. The preparation of complex LMs,
containing an acidic oscillating solution, proves the resilience of LMs and
their application in transporting a wide range of chemical cargoes and in
playing a mediating role in chemical reactions. PTFE-coated LMs were harder to
prepare and not as robust as PE-coated LMs, therefore oscillation studies of BZ
LMs positioned in arrays only focused on PE-coated LMs. Sporadic transfer of
excitation waves was observed between LMs placed in close proximity to each
other in ordered and disordered arrays, suggesting the transfer of liquid
species possibly arises from contact between imperfectly coated areas at the
LM--LM interface or capillary action, where solution is actively transported to
the marble surface through the coating. Propagation pathways of the excitation
waves in both the disordered and ordered arrays of BZ LMs are reported. These
results lay the foundations for future studies on information transmission and
processing arrays of BZ LMs, in addition to observing BZ wave propagation in a
LM and the effect of other physical stimuli such as heat, light and chemical
environments on the dynamics of excitation in arrays of BZ Lms.
"
1198,NISQ circuit compilation is the travelling salesman problem on a torus,"  Noisy, intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers are expected to execute
quantum circuits of up to a few hundred qubits. The circuits have to conform to
NISQ architectural constraints regarding qubit allocation and the execution of
multi-qubit gates. Quantum circuit compilation (QCC) takes a nonconforming
circuit and outputs a compatible circuit. Can classical optimisation methods be
used for QCC? Compilation is a known combinatorial problem shown to be solvable
by two types of operations: 1) qubit allocation, and 2) gate scheduling. We
show informally that the two operations form a discrete ring. The search
landscape of QCC is a two dimensional discrete torus where vertices represent
configurations of how circuit qubits are allocated to NISQ registers. Torus
edges are weighted by the cost of scheduling circuit gates. The novelty of our
approach uses the fact that a circuit's gate list is circular: compilation can
start from any gate as long as all the gates will be processed, and the
compiled circuit has the correct gate order. By showing that QCC can be solved
as a travelling salesman problem, we bridge a theoretical and practical gap
between classical circuit design automation and the emerging field of quantum
circuit optimisation.
"
1199,Energy Efficient Tri-State CNFET Ternary Logic Gates,"  Traditional silicon binary circuits continue to face challenges such as high
leakage power dissipation and large area of interconnections. Multiple-Valued
Logic (MVL) and nano devices are two feasible solutions to overcome these
problems. In this paper, a novel method is presented to design ternary logic
circuits based on Carbon Nanotube Field Effect Transistors (CNFETs). The
proposed designs use the unique properties of CNFETs, for example, adjusting
the Carbon Nanontube (CNT) diameters to have the desired threshold voltage and
have the same mobility of P-FET and N-FET transistors. Each of our designed
logic circuits implements a logic function and its complementary via a control
signal. Also, these circuits have a high impedance state which saves power
while the circuits are not in use. In an effort to show a more detailed
application of our approach, we design a 2-digit adder-subtractor circuit. We
simulate the proposed ternary circuits using HSPICE via standard 32nm CNFET
technology. The simulation results indicate the correct operation of the
designs under different process, voltage and temperature (PVT) variations.
Moreover, a power efficient ternary logic ALU has been design based on the
proposed gates.
"
1200,Index Modulation for Molecular Communication via Diffusion Systems,"  Molecular communication via diffusion (MCvD) is a molecular communication
method that utilizes the free diffusion of carrier molecules to transfer
information at the nano-scale. Due to the random propagation of carrier
molecules, inter-symbol interference (ISI) is a major issue in an MCvD system.
Alongside ISI, inter-link interference (ILI) is also an issue that increases
the total interference for MCvD-based multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO)
approaches. Inspired by the antenna index modulation (IM) concept in
traditional communication systems, this paper introduces novel IM-based
transmission schemes for MCvD systems. In the paper, molecular space shift
keying (MSSK) is proposed as a novel modulation for molecular MIMO systems, and
it is found that this method combats ISI and ILI considerably better than
existing MIMO approaches. For nano-machines that have access to two different
molecules, the direct extension of MSSK, quadrature molecular space shift
keying (QMSSK) is also proposed. QMSSK is found to combat ISI considerably well
whilst not performing well against ILI-caused errors. In order to combat ILI
more effectively, another dual-molecule-based novel modulation scheme called
the molecular spatial modulation (MSM) is proposed. Combined with the Gray
mapping imposed on the antenna indices, MSM is observed to yield reliable error
rates for molecular MIMO systems.

  and Education in Chemistry and Structural Biology","  This article reports prototype web apps that use commodity, open-source
technologies for augmented and virtual reality to provide immersive,
interactive human-computer interfaces for chemistry, structural biology and

"
1202,Emulating the coherent Ising machine with a mean-field algorithm,"  The coherent Ising machine is an optical processor that uses coherent laser
pulses, but does not employ coherent quantum dynamics in a computational role.
Core to its operation is the iterated simulation of all-to-all spin coupling
via mean-field calculation in a classical FPGA coprocessor. Although it has
been described as ""operating at the quantum limit"" and a ""quantum artificial
brain"", interaction with the FPGA prevents the coherent Ising machine from
exploiting quantum effects in its computations. Thus the question naturally
arises: Can the optical portion of the coherent Ising machine be replaced with
classical mean-field arithmetic? Here we answer this in the affirmative by
showing that a straightforward noisy version of mean-field annealing closely
matches CIM performance scaling, while running roughly 20 times faster in
absolute terms.
"
1203,"Quantum computing cryptography: Finding cryptographic Boolean functions
  with quantum annealing by a 2000 qubit D-wave quantum computer","  As the building block in symmetric cryptography, designing Boolean functions
satisfying multiple properties is an important problem in sequence ciphers,
block ciphers, and hash functions. However, the search of $n$-variable Boolean
functions fulfilling global cryptographic constraints is computationally hard
due to the super-exponential size $\mathcal{O}(2^{2^n})$ of the space. Here, we
introduce a codification of the cryptographically relevant constraints in the
ground state of an Ising Hamiltonian, allowing us to naturally encode it in a
quantum annealer, which seems to provide a quantum speedup. Additionally, we
benchmark small $n$ cases in a D-Wave machine, showing its capacity of devising
bent functions, the most relevant set of cryptographic Boolean functions. We
have complemented it with local search and chain repair to improve the D-Wave
quantum annealer performance related to the low connectivity. This work shows
how to codify super-exponential cryptographic problems into quantum annealers
and paves the way for reaching quantum supremacy with an adequately designed
chip.
"
1204,In-situ Stochastic Training of MTJ Crossbar based Neural Networks,"  Owing to high device density, scalability and non-volatility, Magnetic Tunnel
Junction-based crossbars have garnered significant interest for implementing
the weights of an artificial neural network. The existence of only two stable
states in MTJs implies a high overhead of obtaining optimal binary weights in
software. We illustrate that the inherent parallelism in the crossbar structure
makes it highly appropriate for in-situ training, wherein the network is taught
directly on the hardware. It leads to significantly smaller training overhead
as the training time is independent of the size of the network, while also
circumventing the effects of alternate current paths in the crossbar and
accounting for manufacturing variations in the device. We show how the
stochastic switching characteristics of MTJs can be leveraged to perform
probabilistic weight updates using the gradient descent algorithm. We describe
how the update operations can be performed on crossbars both with and without
access transistors and perform simulations on them to demonstrate the
effectiveness of our techniques. The results reveal that stochastically trained
MTJ-crossbar NNs achieve a classification accuracy nearly same as that of
real-valued-weight networks trained in software and exhibit immunity to device
variations.
"
1205,Generalized Reversible Computing,"  Landauer's Principle that information loss from a computation implies entropy
increase can be rigorously proved from mathematical physics. However, carefully
examining its detailed formulation reveals that the traditional identification
of logically reversible computational operations with bijective transformations
of the full digital state space is actually not the correct logical-level
characterization of the full set of classical computational operations that can
be carried out physically with asymptotically zero energy dissipation. To find
the correct logical conditions for physical reversibility, we must account for
initial-state probabilities when applying the Principle. The minimal
logical-level requirement for the physical reversibility of deterministic
computational operations is that the subset of initial states that exhibit
nonzero probability in a given statistical operating context must be
transformed one-to-one into final states. Thus, any computational operation is
conditionally reversible relative to any sufficiently-restrictive precondition
on its initial state, and the minimum dissipation required for any
deterministic operation by Landauer's Principle asymptotically approaches 0
when the probability of meeting any preselected one of its suitable
preconditions approaches 1. This realization facilitates simpler designs for
asymptotically thermodynamically reversible computational hardware, compared to
designs that are restricted to using only fully-bijective operations such as
Toffoli type operations. Thus, this more general framework for reversible
computing provides a more effective theoretical foundation to use for the
design of practical reversible computers than does the more restrictive
traditional model of reversible logic. In this paper, we formally develop the
theoretical foundations of the generalized model, and briefly survey some of
its applications.
"
1206,Skyrmion Logic System for Large-Scale Reversible Computation,"  Computational reversibility is necessary for quantum computation and inspires
the development of computing systems in which information carriers are
conserved as they flow through a circuit. While conservative logic provides an
exciting vision for reversible computing with no energy dissipation, the large
dimensions of information carriers in previous realizations detract from the
system efficiency, and nanoscale conservative logic remains elusive. We
therefore propose a non-volatile reversible computing system in which the
information carriers are magnetic skyrmions, topologically-stable magnetic
whirls. These nanoscale quasiparticles interact with one another via the
spin-Hall and skyrmion-Hall effects as they propagate through ferromagnetic
nanowires structured to form cascaded conservative logic gates. These logic
gates can be directly cascaded in large-scale systems that perform complex
logic functions, with signal integrity provided by clocked synchronization
structures. The feasibility of the proposed system is demonstrated through
micromagnetic simulations of Boolean logic gates, a Fredkin gate, and a
cascaded full adder. As skyrmions can be transported in a pipelined and
non-volatile manner at room temperature without the motion of any physical
particles, this skyrmion logic system has the potential to deliver scalable
high-speed low-power reversible Boolean and quantum computing.
"
1207,Stress-testing memcomputing on hard combinatorial optimization problems,"  Memcomputing is a novel paradigm of computation that utilizes dynamical
elements with memory to both store and process information on the same physical
location. Its building blocks can be fabricated in hardware with standard
electronic circuits, thus offering a path to its practical realization. In
addition, since memcomputing is based on non-quantum elements, the equations of
motion describing these machines can be simulated efficiently on standard
computers. In fact, it was recently realized that memcomputing, and in
particular its digital (hence scalable) version, when simulated on a classical
machine provides a significant speed-up over state-of-the-art algorithms on a
variety of non-convex problems. Here, we stress-test the capabilities of this
approach on finding approximate solutions to hard combinatorial optimization
problems. These fall into a class which is known to require exponentially
growing resources in the worst cases, even to generate approximations. We
recently showed that in a region where state of the art algorithms demonstrate
this exponential growth, simulations of digital memcomputing machines performed
using the Falcon$^\copyright$ simulator of MemComputing, Inc. only require time
and memory resources that scale linearly. These results are extended in a
stress-test up to $64\times10^6$ variables (corresponding to about 1 billion
literals), namely the largest case that we could fit on a single node with 128
GB of DRAM. Since memcomputing can be applied to a wide variety of optimization
problems, this stress test shows the considerable advantage of
non-combinatorial, physics-inspired approaches over standard combinatorial
ones.
"
1208,"Xcel-RAM: Accelerating Binary Neural Networks in High-Throughput SRAM
  Compute Arrays","  Deep neural networks are a biologically-inspired class of algorithms that
have recently demonstrated state-of-the-art accuracies involving large-scale
classification and recognition tasks. Indeed, a major landmark that enables
efficient hardware accelerators for deep networks is the recent advances from
the machine learning community that have demonstrated aggressively scaled deep
binary networks with state-of-the-art accuracies. In this paper, we demonstrate
how deep binary networks can be accelerated in modified von-Neumann machines by
enabling binary convolutions within the SRAM array. In general, binary
convolutions consist of bit-wise XNOR followed by a population-count
(popcount). We present a charge sharing XNOR and popcount operation in 10
transistor SRAM cells. We have employed multiple circuit techniques including
dual-read-worldines (Dual-RWL) along with a dual-stage ADC that overcomes the
inaccuracies of a low precision ADC, to achieve a fairly accurate popcount. In
addition, a key highlight of the present work is the fact that we propose
sectioning of the SRAM array by adding switches onto the read-bitlines, thereby
achieving improved parallelism. This is beneficial for deep networks, where the
kernel size grows and requires to be stored in multiple sub-banks. As such, one
needs to evaluate the partial popcount from multiple sub-banks and sum them up
for achieving the final popcount. For n-sections per sub-array, we can perform
n convolutions within one particular sub-bank, thereby improving overall system
throughput as well as the energy efficiency. Our results at the array level
show that the energy consumption and delay per-operation was 1.914pJ and 45ns,
respectively. Moreover, an energy improvement of 2.5x, and a performance
improvement of 4x was achieved by using the proposed sectioned-SRAM, compared
to a non-sectioned SRAM design.
"
1209,Global optimization of spin Hamiltonians with gain-dissipative systems,"  Recently, several platforms were proposed and demonstrated a
proof-of-principle for finding the global minimum of the spin Hamiltonians such
as the Ising and XY models using gain-dissipative quantum and classical
systems. The implementation of dynamical adjustment of the gain and coupling
strengths has been established as a vital feedback mechanism for analog
Hamiltonian physical systems that aim to simulate spin Hamiltonians. Based on
the principle of operation of such simulators we develop a novel class of
gain-dissipative algorithms for global optimisation of NP-hard problems and
show its performance in comparison with the classical global optimisation
algorithms. These systems can be used to study the ground state and statistical
properties of spin systems and as a direct benchmark for the performance
testing of the gain-dissipative physical simulators. The estimates of the time
operation of the physical implementation of the gain-dissipative simulators for
large matrices show a possible speed-up of the several orders of magnitude in
comparison with classical computations.
"
1210,Neuro-memristive Circuits for Edge Computing: A review,"  The volume, veracity, variability, and velocity of data produced from the
ever-increasing network of sensors connected to Internet pose challenges for
power management, scalability, and sustainability of cloud computing
infrastructure. Increasing the data processing capability of edge computing
devices at lower power requirements can reduce several overheads for cloud
computing solutions. This paper provides the review of neuromorphic
CMOS-memristive architectures that can be integrated into edge computing
devices. We discuss why the neuromorphic architectures are useful for edge
devices and show the advantages, drawbacks and open problems in the field of
neuro-memristive circuits for edge computing.
"
1211,Efficient ConvNets for Analog Arrays,"  Analog arrays are a promising upcoming hardware technology with the potential
to drastically speed up deep learning. Their main advantage is that they
compute matrix-vector products in constant time, irrespective of the size of
the matrix. However, early convolution layers in ConvNets map very unfavorably
onto analog arrays, because kernel matrices are typically small and the
constant time operation needs to be sequentially iterated a large number of
times, reducing the speed up advantage for ConvNets. Here, we propose to
replicate the kernel matrix of a convolution layer on distinct analog arrays,
and randomly divide parts of the compute among them, so that multiple kernel
matrices are trained in parallel. With this modification, analog arrays execute
ConvNets with an acceleration factor that is proportional to the number of
kernel matrices used per layer (here tested 16-128). Despite having more free
parameters, we show analytically and in numerical experiments that this
convolution architecture is self-regularizing and implicitly learns similar
filters across arrays. We also report superior performance on a number of
datasets and increased robustness to adversarial attacks. Our investigation
suggests to revise the notion that mixed analog-digital hardware is not
suitable for ConvNets.
"
1212,"Crosstalk based Fine-Grained Reconfiguration Techniques for Polymorphic
  Circuits","  Truly polymorphic circuits, whose functionality/circuit behavior can be
altered using a control variable, can provide tremendous benefits in
multi-functional system design and resource sharing. For secure and fault
tolerant hardware designs these can be crucial as well. Polymorphic circuits
work in literature so far either rely on environmental parameters such as
temperature, variation etc. or on special devices such as ambipolar FET,
configurable magnetic devices, etc., that often result in inefficiencies in
performance and/or realization. In this paper, we introduce a novel polymorphic
circuit design approach where deterministic interference between nano-metal
lines is leveraged for logic computing and configuration. For computing, the
proposed approach relies on nano-metal lines, their interference and commonly
used FETs, and for polymorphism, it requires only an extra metal line that
carries the control signal. In this paper, we show a wide range of crosstalk
polymorphic (CT-P) logic gates and their evaluation results. We also show an
example of a large circuit that performs both the functionalities of multiplier
and sorter depending on the configuration signal. Our benchmarking results are
presented in this paper. For CT-P, the transistor count was found to be
significantly less compared to other existing approaches, ranging from 25% to
83%. For example, CT-P AOI21-OA21 cell show 83%, 85% and 50% transistor count
reduction, and MultiplierSorter circuit show 40%, 36% and 28% transistor count
reduction with respect to CMOS, genetically evolved, and ambipolar transistor
based polymorphic circuits respectively.
"
1213,Spatial Modulation for Molecular Communication,"  In this paper, we propose an energy-efficient spatial modulation based
molecular communication (SM-MC) scheme, in which a transmitted symbol is
composed of two parts, i.e., a space derived symbol and a concentration derived
symbol. The space symbol is transmitted by embedding the information into the
index of a single activated transmitter nanomachine. The concentration symbol
is drawn according to the conventional concentration shift keying (CSK)
constellation. Befitting from a single active transmitter during each symbol
transmission period, SM-MC can avoid the inter-link interference problem
existing in the current multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) MC schemes, which
hence enables low-complexity symbol detection and performance improvement.
Specifically, in our low-complexity scheme, the space symbol is first detected
by energy comparison, and then the concentration symbol is detected by the
equal gain combining assisted CSK demodulation. In this paper, we analyze the
symbol error rate (SER) of the SM-MC and its special case, namely the space
shift keying based MC (SSK-MC), where only space symbol is transmitted and no
CSK modulation is invoked. Finally, the analytical results are validated by
computer simulations, and our studies demonstrate that both the SM-MC and
SSK-MC are capable of achieving better SER performance than the conventional
MIMO-MC and single-input single-output MC (SISO-MC) when the same symbol rate
is assumed.
"
1214,An efficient quantum circuits optimizing scheme compared with QISKit,"  Recently, the development of quantum chips has made great progress-- the
number of qubits is increasing and the fidelity is getting higher. However,
qubits of these chips are not always fully connected, which sets additional
barriers for implementing quantum algorithms and programming quantum programs.
In this paper, we introduce a general circuit optimizing scheme, which can
efficiently adjust and optimize quantum circuits according to arbitrary given
qubits' layout by adding additional quantum gates, exchanging qubits and
merging single-qubit gates. Compared with the optimizing algorithm of IBM's
QISKit, the quantum gates consumed by our scheme is 74.7%, and the execution
time is only 12.9% on average.
"
1215,DNA Computing for Combinational Logic,"  With the progressive scale-down of semiconductor's feature size, people are
looking forward to More Moore and More than Moore. In order to offer a possible
alternative implementation process, people are trying to figure out a feasible
transfer from silicon to molecular computing. Such transfer lies on bio-based
modules programming with computer-like logic, aiming at realizing the Turing
machine. To accomplish this, the DNA-based combinational logic is inevitably
the first step we have taken care of. This timely overview paper introduces
combinational logic synthesized in DNA computing from both analog and digital
perspectives separately. State-of-the-art research progress is summarized for
interested readers to quick understand DNA computing, initiate discussion on
existing techniques and inspire innovation solutions. We hope this paper can
pave the way for the future DNA computing synthesis.
"
1216,Quantum circuits for floating-point arithmetic,"  Quantum algorithms to solve practical problems in quantum chemistry,
materials science, and matrix inversion often involve a significant amount of
arithmetic operations which act on a superposition of inputs. These have to be
compiled to a set of fault-tolerant low-level operations and throughout this
translation process, the compiler aims to come close to the Pareto-optimal
front between the number of required qubits and the depth of the resulting
circuit. In this paper, we provide quantum circuits for floating-point addition
and multiplication which we find using two vastly different approaches. The
first approach is to automatically generate circuits from classical Verilog
implementations using synthesis tools and the second is to generate and
optimize these circuits by hand. We compare our two approaches and provide
evidence that floating-point arithmetic is a viable candidate for use in
quantum computing, at least for typical scientific applications, where addition
operations usually do not dominate the computation. All our circuits were
constructed and tested using the software tools LIQ$Ui|\rangle{}$ and RevKit.
"
1217,Managing approximation errors in quantum programs,"  We address the problem of distributing approximation errors in large-scale
quantum programs. It has been known for some time that when compiling quantum
algorithms for a fault-tolerant architecture, some operations must be
approximated as they cannot be implemented with arbitrary accuracy by the
underlying gate set. This leads to approximation errors which often can be
grouped along subroutines that the given quantum algorithm is composed of.
Typically, choices can be made as to how to distribute approximation errors so
that the overall error is kept beneath a user- or application-defined
threshold. These choices impact the resource footprint of the fault-tolerant
implementation. We develop an automatic approximation error management module
to tackle the resulting optimization problems. The module is based on annealing
and can be integrated into any quantum software framework. Using the benchmark
of simulating an Ising model with transverse field, we provide numerical
results to quantify the benefits and trade-offs involved in our approach.
"
1218,"Accelerated physical emulation of Bayesian inference in spiking neural
  networks","  The massively parallel nature of biological information processing plays an
important role for its superiority to human-engineered computing devices. In
particular, it may hold the key to overcoming the von Neumann bottleneck that
limits contemporary computer architectures. Physical-model neuromorphic devices
seek to replicate not only this inherent parallelism, but also aspects of its
microscopic dynamics in analog circuits emulating neurons and synapses.
However, these machines require network models that are not only adept at
solving particular tasks, but that can also cope with the inherent
imperfections of analog substrates. We present a spiking network model that
performs Bayesian inference through sampling on the BrainScaleS neuromorphic
platform, where we use it for generative and discriminative computations on
visual data. By illustrating its functionality on this platform, we implicitly
demonstrate its robustness to various substrate-specific distortive effects, as
well as its accelerated capability for computation. These results showcase the
advantages of brain-inspired physical computation and provide important
building blocks for large-scale neuromorphic applications.
"
1219,Overview and Comparison of Gate Level Quantum Software Platforms,"  Quantum computers are available to use over the cloud, but the recent
explosion of quantum software platforms can be overwhelming for those deciding
on which to use. In this paper, we provide a current picture of the rapidly
evolving quantum computing landscape by comparing four software
platforms---Forest (pyQuil), Qiskit, ProjectQ, and the Quantum Developer Kit
(Q\#)---that enable researchers to use real and simulated quantum devices. Our
analysis covers requirements and installation, language syntax through example
programs, library support, and quantum simulator capabilities for each
platform. For platforms that have quantum computer support, we compare
hardware, quantum assembly languages, and quantum compilers. We conclude by
covering features of each and briefly mentioning other quantum computing
software packages.
"
1220,Reservoir Computing Universality With Stochastic Inputs,"  The universal approximation properties with respect to $L ^p $-type criteria
of three important families of reservoir computers with stochastic
discrete-time semi-infinite inputs is shown. First, it is proved that linear
reservoir systems with either polynomial or neural network readout maps are
universal. More importantly, it is proved that the same property holds for two
families with linear readouts, namely, trigonometric state-affine systems and
echo state networks, which are the most widely used reservoir systems in
applications. The linearity in the readouts is a key feature in supervised
machine learning applications. It guarantees that these systems can be used in
high-dimensional situations and in the presence of large datasets. The $L ^p $
criteria used in this paper allow the formulation of universality results that
do not necessarily impose almost sure uniform boundedness in the inputs or the
fading memory property in the filter that needs to be approximated.
"
1221,"Emergence of Altruism Behavior for Multi Feeding Areas in Army Ant
  Social Evolutionary System","  Army ants perform the altruism that an ant sacrifices its own well-being for
the benefit of another ants. Army ants build bridges using their own bodies
along the path from a food to the nest. We developed the army ant inspired
social evolutionary system which can perform the altruism. The system has 2
kinds of ant agents, `Major ant' and `Minor ant' and the ants communicate with
each other via pheromones. One ants can recognize them as the signals from the
other ants. The pheromones evaporate with the certain ratio and diffused into
the space of neighbors stochastically. If the optimal bridge is found, the path
through the bridge is the shortest route from foods to the nest. We define the
probability for an ant to leave a bridge at a low occupancy condition of ants
and propose the constructing method of the optimal route. In this paper, the
behaviors of ant under the environment with two or more feeding spots are
observed. Some experimental results show the behaviors of great interest with
respect to altruism of ants. The description in some computer simulation is
reported in this paper.
"
1222,Direction of Arrival Estimation for Nanoscale Sensor Networks,"  Nanoscale wireless sensor networks (NWSNs) could be within reach soon using
graphene-based antennas, which resonate in 0.1-10 terahertz band. To conserve
the limited energy available at nanoscale, it is expected that NWSNs will
communicate using extremely short pulses on the order of femtoseconds. Accurate
estimation of direction of arrival (DOA) for such terahertz pulses will help
realize many useful applications for NWSNs. In this paper, using the well-known
MUltiple SIgnal Classification (MUSIC) algorithm, we study DOA estimation for
NWSNs for different energy levels, distances, pulse shapes, and frequencies.
Our analyses reveal that the best DOA estimation is achieved with the first
order Gaussian pulses, which emit their peak energy at 6 THz. Based on Monte
Carlo simulations, we demonstrate that MUSIC algorithm is capable of estimating
DOA with root mean square error less than one degree from a distance of around
6 meter for pulse energy as little as 1 atto Joule.
"
1223,"Hierarchical Growth is Necessary and (Sometimes) Sufficient to
  Self-Assemble Discrete Self-Similar Fractals","  In this paper, we prove that in the abstract Tile Assembly Model (aTAM), an
accretion-based model which only allows for a single tile to attach to a
growing assembly at each step, there are no tile assembly systems capable of
self-assembling the discrete self-similar fractals known as the ""H"" and ""U""
fractals. We then show that in a related model which allows for hierarchical
self-assembly, the 2-Handed Assembly Model (2HAM), there does exist a tile
assembly systems which self-assembles the ""U"" fractal and conjecture that the
same holds for the ""H"" fractal. This is the first example of discrete self
similar fractals which self-assemble in the 2HAM but not in the aTAM, providing
a direct comparison of the models and greater understanding of the power of
hierarchical assembly.
"
1224,Perceptrons from Memristors,"  Memristors, resistors with memory whose outputs depend on the history of
their inputs, have been used with success in neuromorphic architectures,
particularly as synapses and non-volatile memories. However, to the best of our
knowledge, no model for a network in which both the synapses and the neurons
are implemented using memristors has been proposed so far. In the present work
we introduce models for single and multilayer perceptrons based exclusively on
memristors. We adapt the delta rule to the memristor-based single-layer
perceptron and the backpropagation algorithm to the memristor-based multilayer
perceptron. Our results show that both perform as expected for perceptrons,
including satisfying Minsky-Papert's theorem. As a consequence of the Universal
Approximation Theorem, they also show that memristors are universal function
approximators. By using memristors for both the neurons and the synapses, our
models pave the way for novel memristor-based neural network architectures and
algorithms. A neural network based on memristors could show advantages in terms
of energy conservation and open up possibilities for other learning systems to
be adapted to a memristor-based paradigm, both in the classical and quantum
learning realms.
"
1225,"A neuromorphic systems approach to in-memory computing with non-ideal
  memristive devices: From mitigation to exploitation","  Memristive devices represent a promising technology for building neuromorphic
electronic systems. In addition to their compactness and non-volatility
features, they are characterized by computationally relevant physical
properties, such as state-dependence, non-linear conductance changes, and
intrinsic variability in both their switching threshold and conductance values,
that make them ideal devices for emulating the bio-physics of real synapses. In
this paper we present a spiking neural network architecture that supports the
use of memristive devices as synaptic elements, and propose mixed-signal
analog-digital interfacing circuits which mitigate the effect of variability in
their conductance values and exploit their variability in the switching
threshold, for implementing stochastic learning. The effect of device
variability is mitigated by using pairs of memristive devices configured in a
complementary push-pull mechanism and interfaced to a current-mode normalizer
circuit. The stochastic learning mechanism is obtained by mapping the desired
change in synaptic weight into a corresponding switching probability that is
derived from the intrinsic stochastic behavior of memristive devices. We
demonstrate the features of the CMOS circuits and apply the architecture
proposed to a standard neural network hand-written digit classification
benchmark based on the MNIST data-set. We evaluate the performance of the
approach proposed on this benchmark using behavioral-level spiking neural
network simulation, showing both the effect of the reduction in conductance
variability produced by the current-mode normalizer circuit, and the increase
in performance as a function of the number of memristive devices used in each
synapse.
"
1226,Extending the D-Wave with support for Higher Precision Coefficients,"  D-Wave only guarantees to support coefficients with 4 to 5 bits of resolution
or precision. This paper describes a method to extend the functionality of the
D-Wave to solve problems that require the support of higher precision
coefficients.
"
1227,On discovering functions in actin filament automata,"  We simulate an actin filament as an automaton network. Every atom takes two
or three states and updates its state, in discrete time, depending on a ratio
of its neighbours in some selected state. All atoms/automata simultaneously
update their states by the same rule. Two state transition rules are
considered. In semi-totalistic Game of Life like actin filament automaton atoms
take binary states `0' and `1' and update their states depending on a ratio of
neighbours in the state `1'. In excitable actin filament automaton atoms take
three states: resting, excited and refractory. A resting atom excites if a
ratio of its excited neighbours belong to some specified interval; transitions
from excited state to refractory state and from refractory state to resting
state are unconditional. In computational experiments we implement mappings of
8-bit input string to 8-bit output string via dynamics of
perturbation/excitation on actin filament automata. We assign eight domains in
an actin filament as I/O ports. To write {\sc True} to a port we perturb/excite
a certain percentage of the nodes in the domain corresponding to the port. We
read outputs at the ports after some time interval. A port is considered to be
in a state {\sc True} if a number of excited nodes in the port's domain exceed
a certain threshold. A range of eight-argument Boolean functions is uncovered
in a series of computational trials when all possible configurations of
eight-elements binary strings were mapped onto excitation outputs of the I/O
domains.
"
1228,"Hardware Optimizations of Dense Binary Hyperdimensional Computing:
  Rematerialization of Hypervectors, Binarized Bundling, and Combinational
  Associative Memory","  Brain-inspired hyperdimensional (HD) computing models neural activity
patterns of the very size of the brain's circuits with points of a
hyperdimensional space, that is, with hypervectors. Hypervectors are
$D$-dimensional (pseudo)random vectors with independent and identically
distributed (i.i.d.) components constituting ultra-wide holographic words: $D =
10,000$ bits, for instance. At its very core, HD computing manipulates a set of
seed hypervectors to build composite hypervectors representing objects of
interest. It demands memory optimizations with simple operations for an e cient
hardware realization. In this paper, we propose hardware techniques for
optimizations of HD computing, in a synthesizable VHDL library, to enable
co-located implementation of both learning and classification tasks on only a
small portion of Xilinx(R) UltraScale(TM) FPGAs: (1) We propose simple logical
operations to rematerialize the hypervectors on the fly rather than loading
them from memory. These operations massively reduce the memory footprint by
directly computing the composite hypervectors whose individual seed
hypervectors do not need to be stored in memory. (2) Bundling a series of
hypervectors over time requires a multibit counter per every hypervector
component. We instead propose a binarized back-to-back bundling without
requiring any counters. This truly enables on-chip learning with minimal
resources as every hypervector component remains binary over the course of
training to avoid otherwise multibit component. (3) For every classification
event, an associative memory is in charge of finding the closest match between
a set of learned hypervectors and a query hypervector by using a distance
metric. This operator is proportional to [...]
"
1229,PCNNA: A Photonic Convolutional Neural Network Accelerator,"  Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have been the centerpiece of many
applications including but not limited to computer vision, speech processing,
and Natural Language Processing (NLP). However, the computationally expensive
convolution operations impose many challenges to the performance and
scalability of CNNs. In parallel, photonic systems, which are traditionally
employed for data communication, have enjoyed recent popularity for data
processing due to their high bandwidth, low power consumption, and
reconfigurability. Here we propose a Photonic Convolutional Neural Network
Accelerator (PCNNA) as a proof of concept design to speedup the convolution
operation for CNNs. Our design is based on the recently introduced silicon
photonic microring weight banks, which use broadcast-and-weight protocol to
perform Multiply And Accumulate (MAC) operation and move data through layers of
a neural network. Here, we aim to exploit the synergy between the inherent
parallelism of photonics in the form of Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM)
and sparsity of connections between input feature maps and kernels in CNNs.
While our full system design offers up to more than 3 orders of magnitude
speedup in execution time, its optical core potentially offers more than 5
order of magnitude speedup compared to state-of-the-art electronic
counterparts.
"
1230,Exploring Tehran with excitable medium,"  An excitable chemical medium --- Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction --- is
proven to be a fruitful substrate for prototyping unconventional computing
devices. These include image processors, logical circuits, and robot
controllers. We study a BZ potential for characterising a geometry of street
networks on a fragment of Tehran street map. The city was chosen because it is
one of the most populated cities in the World with nearly uncontrollable urban
growth. In numerical experiments with Oregonator model of BZ reaction, we
demonstrate that excitability of the medium allows acts as a selector between
omnidirectional waves and soliton-like localised excitations. We uncover a
phase-transition like dynamics, controlled by the excitability, of coverage of
the street network by excitation wave-fronts. In the cluster analysis, we show
how the network geometry, when it meets propagation of BZ wave-front, relates
to the traffic flow of Tehran
"
1231,On complexity of post-processing in analyzing GATE-driven X-ray spectrum,"  Computed Tomography (CT) imaging is one of the most influential diagnostic
methods. In clinical reconstruction, an effective energy is used instead of
total X-ray spectrum. This approximation causes an accuracy decline. To
increase the contrast, single source or dual source dual energy CT can be used
to reach optimal values of tissue differentiation. However, these
infrastructures are still at the laboratory level, and their safeties for
patients are still yet to mature. Therefore, computer modelling of DECT could
be used. We propose a novel post-processing approach for converting a total
X-ray spectrum into irregular intervals of quantized energy. We simulate a
phantom in GATE/GEANT4 and irradiate it based on CT configuration. Inverse
Radon transform is applied to the acquired sinogram to construct the
Pixel-based Attenuation Matrix (PAM). To construct images represented by each
interval, water attenuation coefficient of the interval is extracted from NIST
and used in the Hounsfield unit (HU) scale in conjunction with PAM. The CT
image is modified by using of an associated normalized photon flux and
calculated HU corresponding to the interval. We demonstrate the proposed method
efficiency via complexity analysis, using absolute and relative complexities,
entropy measures, Kolmogorov complexity, morphological richness, and
quantitative segmentation criteria associated with standard fuzzy C-means. The
irregularity of the modified CT images decreases over the simulated ones.
"
1232,Channel Dependent Mutual Information in Index Modulations,"  Mutual Information is the metric that is used to perform link adaptation,
which allows to achieve rates near capacity. The computation of adaptive
transmission modes is achieved by employing the mapping between the Signal to
Noise Ratio and the Mutual Information. Due to the high complexity of the
computation of the Mutual Information, this process is performed off-line via
Monte Carlo simulations, whose results are stored in look-up tables. However,
in Index Modulations, such as Spatial Modulation or Polarized Modulation, this
is not feasible since the constellation and the Mutual Information are channel
dependent and it would require to compute this metric at each time instant if
the channel is time varying. In this paper, we propose different approximations
in order to obtain a simple closed-form expression that allows to compute the
Mutual Information at each time instant and thus, making feasible the link
adaptation.
"
1233,"Practical Implementation of Link Adaptation with Dual Polarized
  Modulation","  The use of dual polarization in mobile satellite systems is very promising
for increasing the channel capacity. Polarized Modulation is proposed in this
paper for use in practical systems, by providing simple equations for computing
its capacity and featuring a link adaptation algorithm. This scheme shows
remarkable gains in the spectral efficiency when compared with single
polarization and other multi-antenna techniques such as V-BLAST. Polarized
Modulation is a particular instance of more general Index Modulations, which
are being considered for 5G networks. Thus, the proposed link adaptation
algorithm could find synergies with current activities for future terrestrial
networks.
"
1234,Millimeter-Wave Propagation within a Computer Chip Package,"  Wireless Network-on-Chip (WNoC) appears as a promising alternative to
conventional interconnect fabrics for chip-scale communications. The WNoC
paradigm has been extensively analyzed from the physical, network and
architecture perspectives assuming mmWave band operation. However, there has
not been a comprehensive study at this band for realistic chip packages and,
thus, the characteristics of such wireless channel remain not fully understood.
This work addresses this issue by accurately modeling a flip-chip package and
investigating the wave propagation inside it. Through parametric studies, a
locally optimal configuration for 60 GHz WNoC is obtained, showing that
chip-wide attenuation below 32.6 dB could be achieved with standard processes.
Finally, the applicability of the methodology is discussed for higher bands and
other integrated environments such as a Software-Defined Metamaterial (SDM).

1235,Quantized Single-Ion-Channel Hodgkin-Huxley Model for Quantum Neurons,"  The Hodgkin-Huxley model describes the behavior of the cell membrane in
neurons, treating each part of it as an electric circuit element, namely
capacitors, memristors, and voltage sources. We focus on the activation channel
of potassium ions, due to its simplicity, while keeping most of the features
displayed by the original model. This reduced version is essentially a
classical memristor, a resistor whose resistance depends on the history of
electric signals that have crossed it, coupled to a voltage source and a
capacitor. Here, we will consider a quantized Hodgkin-Huxley model based on a
quantum memristor formalism. We compare the behavior of the membrane voltage
and the potassium channel conductance, when the circuit is subjected to AC
sources, in both classical and quantum realms. Numerical simulations show an
expected adaptation of the considered channel conductance depending on the
signal history in all regimes. Remarkably, the computation of higher moments of
the voltage manifest purely quantum features related to the circuit zero-point
energy. Finally, we study the implementation of the Hodgkin-Huxley quantum
memristor as an asymmetric rf SQUID in superconducting circuits. This study may
allow the construction of quantum neuron networks inspired in the brain
function, as well as the design of neuromorphic quantum architectures for
quantum machine learning.
"
1236,Quantum Supremacy Is Both Closer and Farther than It Appears,"  As quantum computers improve in the number of qubits and fidelity, the
question of when they surpass state-of-the-art classical computation for a
well-defined computational task is attracting much attention. The leading
candidate task for this milestone entails sampling from the output distribution
defined by a random quantum circuit. We develop a massively-parallel simulation
tool Rollright that does not require inter-process communication (IPC) or
proprietary hardware. We also develop two ways to trade circuit fidelity for
computational speedups, so as to match the fidelity of a given quantum computer
--- a task previously thought impossible. We report massive speedups for the
sampling task over prior software from Microsoft, IBM, Alibaba and Google, as
well as supercomputer and GPU-based simulations. By using publicly available
Google Cloud Computing, we price such simulations and enable comparisons by
total cost across hardware platforms. We simulate approximate sampling from the
output of a circuit with 7x8 qubits and depth 1+40+1 by producing one million
bitstring probabilities with fidelity 0.5%, at an estimated cost of $35184. The
simulation costs scale linearly with fidelity, and using this scaling we
estimate that extending circuit depth to 1+48+1 increases costs to one million
dollars. Scaling the simulation to 10M bitstring probabilities needed for
sampling 1M bitstrings helps comparing simulation to quantum computers. We
describe refinements in benchmarks that slow down leading simulators, halving
the circuit depth that can be simulated within the same time.
"
1237,Pareto-Optimization Framework for Automated Network-on-Chip Design,"  With the advent of multi-core processors, network-on-chip design has been key
in addressing network performances, such as bandwidth, power consumption, and
communication delays when dealing with on-chip communication between the
increasing number of processor cores. As the numbers of cores increase, network
design becomes more complex. Therefore, there is a critical need in soliciting
computer aid in determining network configurations that afford optimal
performance given resources and design constraints. We propose a
Pareto-optimization framework that explores the space of possible network
configurations to determine optimal network latencies, power consumption, and
the corresponding link allocations. For a given number of routers, average
network latency and power consumption as example performance objectives can be
displayed in form of Pareto-optimal fronts, thus not only offering a design
tool, but also enabling trade-off studies.
"
1238,Matrix optimization on universal unitary photonic devices,"  Universal unitary photonic devices can apply arbitrary unitary
transformations to a vector of input modes and provide a promising hardware
platform for fast and energy-efficient machine learning using light. We
simulate the gradient-based optimization of random unitary matrices on
universal photonic devices composed of imperfect tunable interferometers. If
device components are initialized uniform-randomly, the locally-interacting
nature of the mesh components biases the optimization search space towards
banded unitary matrices, limiting convergence to random unitary matrices. We
detail a procedure for initializing the device by sampling from the
distribution of random unitary matrices and show that this greatly improves
convergence speed. We also explore mesh architecture improvements such as
adding extra tunable beamsplitters or permuting waveguide layers to further
improve the training speed and scalability of these devices.
"
1239,Memristor-based Synaptic Sampling Machines,"  Synaptic Sampling Machine (SSM) is a type of neural network model that
considers biological unreliability of the synapses. We propose the circuit
design of the SSM neural network which is realized through the memristive-CMOS
crossbar structure with the synaptic sampling cell (SSC) being used as a basic
stochastic unit. The increase in the edge computing devices in the Internet of
things era, drives the need for hardware acceleration for data processing and
computing. The computational considerations of the processing speed and
possibility for the real-time realization pushes the synaptic sampling
algorithm that demonstrated promising results on software for hardware
implementation.
"
1240,Approximate Probabilistic Neural Networks with Gated Threshold Logic,"  Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN) is a feed-forward artificial neural
network developed for solving classification problems. This paper proposes a
hardware implementation of an approximated PNN (APNN) algorithm in which the
conventional exponential function of the PNN is replaced with gated threshold
logic. The weights of the PNN are approximated using a memristive crossbar
architecture. In particular, the proposed algorithm performs normalization of
the training weights, and quantization into 16 levels which significantly
reduces the complexity of the circuit.
"
1241,"Binary Weighted Memristive Analog Deep Neural Network for Near-Sensor
  Edge Processing","  The memristive crossbar aims to implement analog weighted neural network,
however, the realistic implementation of such crossbar arrays is not possible
due to limited switching states of memristive devices. In this work, we propose
the design of an analog deep neural network with binary weight update through
backpropagation algorithm using binary state memristive devices. We show that
such networks can be successfully used for image processing task and has the
advantage of lower power consumption and small on-chip area in comparison with
digital counterparts. The proposed network was benchmarked for MNIST
handwritten digits recognition achieving an accuracy of approximately 90%.
"
1242,"A Photonic In-Memory Computing primitive for Spiking Neural Networks
  using Phase-Change Materials","  Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer an event-driven and more biologically
realistic alternative to standard Artificial Neural Networks based on analog
information processing. This can potentially enable energy-efficient hardware
implementations of neuromorphic systems which emulate the functional units of
the brain, namely, neurons and synapses. Recent demonstrations of ultra-fast
photonic computing devices based on phase-change materials (PCMs) show promise
of addressing limitations of electrically driven neuromorphic systems. However,
scaling these standalone computing devices to a parallel in-memory computing
primitive is a challenge. In this work, we utilize the optical properties of
the PCM, Ge\textsubscript{2}Sb\textsubscript{2}Te\textsubscript{5} (GST), to
propose a Photonic Spiking Neural Network computing primitive, comprising of a
non-volatile synaptic array integrated seamlessly with previously explored
`integrate-and-fire' neurons. The proposed design realizes an `in-memory'
computing platform that leverages the inherent parallelism of
wavelength-division-multiplexing (WDM). We show that the proposed computing
platform can be used to emulate a SNN inferencing engine for image
classification tasks. The proposed design not only bridges the gap between
isolated computing devices and parallel large-scale implementation, but also
paves the way for ultra-fast computing and localized on-chip learning.
"
1243,"Light-stimulable molecules/nanoparticles networks for switchable logical
  functions and reservoir computing","  We report the fabrication and electron transport properties of nanoparticles
self-assembled networks (NPSAN) of molecular switches (azobenzene derivatives)
interconnected by Au nanoparticles, and we demonstrate optically-driven
switchable logical operations associated to the light controlled switching of
the molecules. The switching yield is up to 74%. We also demonstrate that these
NPSANs are prone for light-stimulable reservoir computing. The complex
non-linearity of electron transport and dynamics in these highly connected and
recurrent networks of molecular junctions exhibit rich high harmonics
generation (HHG) required for reservoir computing (RC) approaches. Logical
functions and HHG are controlled by the isomerization of the molecules upon
light illumination. These results, without direct analogs in semiconductor
devices, open new perspectives to molecular electronics in unconventional
computing.
"
1244,On-Chip Optical Convolutional Neural Networks,"  Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a class of Artificial Neural
Networks(ANNs) that employ the method of convolving input images with
filter-kernels for object recognition and classification purposes. In this
paper, we propose a photonics circuit architecture which could consume a
fraction of energy per inference compared with state of the art electronics.
"
1245,"Code-division multiplexed resistive pulse sensor networks for
  spatio-temporal detection of particles in microfluidic devices","  Spatial separation of suspended particles based on contrast in their physical
or chemical properties forms the basis of various biological assays performed
on lab-on-achip devices. To electronically acquire this information, we have
recently introduced a microfluidic sensing platform, called Microfluidic CODES,
which combines the resistive pulse sensing with the code division multiple
access in multiplexing a network of integrated electrical sensors. In this
paper, we enhance the multiplexing capacity of the Microfluidic CODES by
employing sensors that generate non-orthogonal code waveforms and a new
decoding algorithm that combines machine learning techniques with minimum
mean-squared error estimation. As a proof of principle, we fabricated a
microfluidic device with a network of 10 code-multiplexed sensors and
characterized it using cells suspended in phosphate buffer saline solution.
"
1246,Applications of molecular communications to medicine: a survey,"  In recent years, progresses in nanotechnology have established the
foundations for implementing nanomachines capable of carrying out simple but
significant tasks. Under this stimulus, researchers have been proposing various
solutions for realizing nanoscale communications, considering both
electromagnetic and biological communications. Their aim is to extend the
capabilities of nanodevices, so as to enable the execution of more complex
tasks by means of mutual coordination, achievable through communications.
However, although most of these proposals show how devices can communicate at
the nanoscales, they leave in the background specific applications of these new
technologies. Thus, this paper shows an overview of the actual and potential
applications that can rely on a specific class of such communications
techniques, commonly referred to as molecular communications. In particular, we
focus on health-related applications. This decision is due to the rapidly
increasing interests of research communities and companies to minimally
invasive, biocompatible, and targeted health-care solutions. Molecular
communication techniques have actually the potentials of becoming the main
technology for implementing advanced medical solution. Hence, in this paper we
provide a taxonomy of potential applications, illustrate them in some details,
along with the existing open challenges for them to be actually deployed, and
draw future perspectives.
"
1247,A molecular communications model for drug delivery,"  This paper considers the scenario of a targeted drug delivery system, which
consists of deploying a number of biological nanomachines close to a biological
target (e.g. a tumor), able to deliver drug molecules in the diseased area.
Suitably located transmitters are designed to release a continuous flow of drug
molecules in the surrounding environment, where they diffuse and reach the
target. These molecules are received when they chemically react with compliant
receptors deployed on the receiver surface. In these conditions, if the release
rate is relatively high and the drug absorption time is significant, congestion
may happen, essentially at the receiver site. This phenomenon limits the drug
absorption rate and makes the signal transmission ineffective, with an
undesired diffusion of drug molecules elsewhere in the body. The original
contribution of this paper consists of a theoretical analysis of the causes of
congestion in diffusion-based molecular communications. For this purpose, it is
proposed a reception model consisting of a set of pure loss queuing systems.
The proposed model exhibits an excellent agreement with the results of a
simulation campaign made by using the Biological and Nano-Scale communication
simulator version 2 (BiNS2), a well-known simulator for molecular
communications, whose reliability has been assessed through in-vitro
experiments. The obtained results can be used in rate control algorithms to
optimally determine the optimal release rate of molecules in drug delivery
applications.
"
1248,DNA-based chemical compiler,"  Marcello, in 1997, formally proved that chemical kinetics can make a
universal computer i.e they can replicate any digital circuit. Recently,
Soloveichik et al. showed that chemical kinetics can perform fast and reliable
Turing Universal computations. To simulate the behavior of chemical reactions,
Sean et al. developed a software called CAIN which represents chemical
reactions in XML format. In this work, we have made an attempt to create
trans-compiler which can take python like code as input and gives CAIN
supported chemical reactions file as output. This can be compared to generating
assembly code from a high-level programming language. Additionally, Soloveichik
et al. also showed DNA as a universal primer for implementing CRN's and Andrews
Phillips developed Visual DSD programming language for simulating all the
possible DSD reactions. CRN2DSD, a software developed by Manish Gupta's team,
can, already, convert a CAIN file to Microsoft's Visual DSD code i.e assembly
level to machine level. Hence, our attempt to convert high-level code to
assembly code takes us one step closer to completing the dream of making a
chemical compiler.
"
1249,Recent Advances in Physical Reservoir Computing: A Review,"  Reservoir computing is a computational framework suited for
temporal/sequential data processing. It is derived from several recurrent
neural network models, including echo state networks and liquid state machines.
A reservoir computing system consists of a reservoir for mapping inputs into a
high-dimensional space and a readout for pattern analysis from the
high-dimensional states in the reservoir. The reservoir is fixed and only the
readout is trained with a simple method such as linear regression and
classification. Thus, the major advantage of reservoir computing compared to
other recurrent neural networks is fast learning, resulting in low training
cost. Another advantage is that the reservoir without adaptive updating is
amenable to hardware implementation using a variety of physical systems,
substrates, and devices. In fact, such physical reservoir computing has
attracted increasing attention in diverse fields of research. The purpose of
this review is to provide an overview of recent advances in physical reservoir
computing by classifying them according to the type of the reservoir. We
discuss the current issues and perspectives related to physical reservoir
computing, in order to further expand its practical applications and develop
next-generation machine learning systems.
"
1250,"Biological Optical-to-Chemical Signal Conversion Interface: A
  Small-scale Modulator for Molecular Communications","  Although many exciting applications of molecular communication (MC) systems
are envisioned to be at microscale, the MC testbeds reported so far are mostly
at macroscale. To link the macroworld to the microworld, we propose and
demonstrate a biological signal conversion interface that can also be seen as a
microscale modulator. In particular, the proposed interface transduces an
optical signal, which is controlled using an LED, into a chemical signal by
changing the pH of the environment. The modulator is realized using E. coli
bacteria as microscale entity expressing the light-driven proton pump
gloeorhodopsin from Gloeobacter violaceus. Upon inducing external light
stimuli, these bacteria locally change their surrounding pH level by exporting
protons into the environment. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed
optical-to-chemical signal converter, we analyze the pH signal measured by a pH
sensor, which serves as receiver. We develop an analytical parametric model for
the induced chemical signal as a function of the applied optical signal. Using
this model, we derive a training-based channel estimator which estimates the
parameters of the proposed model to fit the measurement data. We further derive
the optimal maximum likelihood detector and a suboptimal low-complexity
detector to recover the transmitted data from the measured received signal. It
is shown that the proposed parametric model is in good agreement with the
measurement data. Moreover, for an example scenario, we show that the proposed
setup is able to successfully convert an optical signal representing a sequence
of binary symbols into a chemical signal with a bit rate of 1 bit/minute and
recover the transmitted data from the chemical signal using the proposed
estimation and detection~schemes. The proposed modulator may form the basis for
future MC testbeds and applications at microscale.
"
1251,"Magnetic Nanoparticle Based Molecular Communication in Microfluidic
  Environments","  The possibility to guide and control magnetic nanoparticles in a non-invasive
manner has spawned various applications in biotechnology such as targeted drug
delivery and sensing of biological substances. These applications are
facilitated by the engineering of the size, selective chemical reactivity, and
general chemical composition of the employed particles. Motivated by their
widespread use and favorable properties, in this paper, we provide a
theoretical study of the potential benefits of magnetic nanoparticles for the
design of molecular communication systems. In particular, we consider magnetic
nanoparticle based communication in a microfluidic channel where an external
magnetic field is employed to attract the information-carrying particles to the
receiver. We show that the particle transport affected by Brownian motion,
fluid flow, and an external magnetic field can be mathematically modeled as
diffusion with drift. Thereby, we reveal that the key parameters determining
the magnetic force are the particle size and the magnetic field gradient.
Moreover, we derive an analytical expression for the channel impulse response,
which is used to evaluate the potential gain in the expected number of observed
nanoparticles due to the magnetic field. Furthermore, adopting the symbol error
rate as performance metric, we show that using magnetic nanoparticles can
enable reliable communication in the presence of disruptive fluid flow.
Numerical results obtained by particle-based simulation validate the accuracy
of the derived analytical expressions.
"
1252,Neuromorphic Architecture for the Hierarchical Temporal Memory,"  A biomimetic machine intelligence algorithm, that holds promise in creating
invariant representations of spatiotemporal input streams is the hierarchical
temporal memory (HTM). This unsupervised online algorithm has been demonstrated
on several machine-learning tasks, including anomaly detection. Significant
effort has been made in formalizing and applying the HTM algorithm to different
classes of problems. There are few early explorations of the HTM hardware
architecture, especially for the earlier version of the spatial pooler of HTM
algorithm. In this article, we present a full-scale HTM architecture for both
spatial pooler and temporal memory. Synthetic synapse design is proposed to
address the potential and dynamic interconnections occurring during learning.
The architecture is interweaved with parallel cells and columns that enable
high processing speed for the HTM. The proposed architecture is verified for
two different datasets: MNIST and the European number plate font (EUNF), with
and without the presence of noise. The spatial pooler architecture is
synthesized on Xilinx ZYNQ-7, with 91.16% classification accuracy for MNIST and
90\% accuracy for EUNF, with noise. For the temporal memory sequence
prediction, first and second order predictions are observed for a 5-number long
sequence generated from EUNF dataset and 95% accuracy is obtained. Moreover,
the proposed hardware architecture offers 1364X speedup over the software
realization. These results indicate that the proposed architecture can serve as
a digital core to build the HTM in hardware and eventually as a standalone
self-learning system.
"
1253,Memristor - The fictional circuit element,"  The memory resistor abbreviated memristor was a harmless postulate in 1971.
In the decade since 2008, a device claiming to be the missing memristor is on
the prowl, seeking recognition as a fundamental circuit element, sometimes
wanting electronics textbooks to be rewritten, always promising remarkable
digital, analog and neuromorphic computing possibilities. A systematic
discussion about the fundamental nature of the device is almost universally
absent. This report investigates the assertion that the memristor is a
fundamental passive circuit element, from the perspective that electrical
engineering is the science of charge management. With a periodic table of
fundamental elements, we demonstrate that there can only be three fundamental
passive circuit elements. The ideal memristor is shown to be an unphysical
active device. A vacancy transport model further reveals that a physically
realizable memristor is a nonlinear composition of two resistors with active
hysteresis.
"
1254,High-Accuracy and Fault Tolerant Stochastic Inner Product Design,"  In this work, we present a novel inner product design for stochastic
computing. Stochastic computing is an emerging computing technique, that
encodes a number in the probability of observing a one in a random bit stream.
This leads to reduced hardware costs and high error tolerance. The proposed
inner product design is based on a two-line bipolar encoding format and applies
sequential processing of the input in a central accumulation unit. Sequential
processing significantly increases the computation accuracy, since it allows
for preliminary cancelation of carry bits. Moreover, the central accumulation
unit gives a much better scalability compared to conventional adder tree
approaches. We show that the proposed inner product design outperforms
state-of-the-art designs in terms of hardware costs for high accuracy
requirements and fault tolerance.
"
1255,"Real-time Analog Pixel-to-pixel Dynamic Frame Differencing with
  Memristive Sensing Circuits","  In this paper, we propose an analog pixel differencing circuit for
differentiating pixels between frames directly from CMOS pixels. The analog
information processing at sensor is a topic of growing appeal to develop edge
AI devices. The proposed circuit is integrated into a pixel-parallel and
pixel-column architectures. The proposed system is design using TSMC $180nm$
CMOS technology. The power dissipation of the proposed circuit is $96.64mW$,
and on-chip ares is $531.66 \mu m^2$. The architectures are tested for moving
object detection application.
"
1256,The Distribution of Reversible Functions is Normal,"  The distribution of reversible programs tends to a limit as their size
increases. For problems with a Hamming distance fitness function the limiting
distribution is binomial with an exponentially small chance (but non~zero)
chance of perfect solution. Sufficiently good reversible circuits are more
common. Expected RMS error is also calculated. Random unitary matrices may
suggest possible extension to quantum computing. Using the genetic programming
(GP) benchmark, the six multiplexor, circuits of Toffoli gates are shown to
give a fitness landscape amenable to evolutionary search. Minimal CCNOT
solutions to the six multiplexer are found but larger circuits are more
evolvable.
"
1257,Robust Chemical Circuits,"  We introduce a new motif for constructing robust digital logic circuits using
input/output chemical reaction networks. These chemical circuits robustly
handle perturbations in input signals, initial concentrations, rate constants,
and measurements. In particular, we show that all combinatorial circuits and
several sequential circuits enjoy this robustness. Our results complement
existing literature in the following three ways: (1) our logic gates read their
inputs catalytically which make `fanout' gates unnecessary; (2) formal
requirements and rigorous proofs of satisfaction are provided for each circuit;
and (3) robustness of every circuit is closed under modular composition.
"
1258,"Semi-Trained Memristive Crossbar Computing Engine with In-Situ Learning
  Accelerator","  On-device intelligence is gaining significant attention recently as it offers
local data processing and low power consumption. In this research, an on-device
training circuitry for threshold-current memristors integrated in a crossbar
structure is proposed. Furthermore, alternate approaches of mapping the
synaptic weights into fully-trained and semi-trained crossbars are
investigated. In a semi-trained crossbar a confined subset of memristors are
tuned and the remaining subset of memristors are not programmed. This
translates to optimal resource utilization and power consumption, compared to a
fully programmed crossbar. The semi-trained crossbar architecture is applicable
to a broad class of neural networks. System level verification is performed
with an extreme learning machine for binomial and multinomial classification.
The total power for a single 4x4 layer network, when implemented in IBM 65nm
node, is estimated to be ~ 42.16uW and the area is estimated to be 26.48um x
22.35um.
"
1259,"Insect cyborgs: Bio-mimetic feature generators improve machine learning
  accuracy on limited data","  Machine learning (ML) classifiers always benefit from more informative input
features. We seek to auto-generate stronger feature sets in order to address
the difficulty that ML methods often experience given limited training data. A
wide range of biological neural nets (BNNs) excel at fast learning, implying
that they are adept at extracting informative features. We can thus look to
BNNs for tools to improve ML performance in this low-data regime. The insect
olfactory network learns new odors very rapidly, by means of three key
elements: A competitive inhibition layer; a high-dimensional sparse plastic
layer; and Hebbian updates of synaptic weights.
  In this work, we deployed MothNet, a computational model of the insect
olfactory network, as an automatic feature generator: Attached as a front-end
pre-processor, its Readout Neurons provided new features, derived from the
original features, for use by standard ML classifiers. We found that these
""insect cyborgs"", i.e. classifiers that are part-insect model and part-ML
method, had significantly better performance than baseline ML methods alone on
a vectorized MNIST dataset. The MothNet feature generator also substantially
out-performed other feature generating methods such as PCA, PLS, and NNs, as
well as pre-training to initialize NN weights. Cyborgs improved relative test
set accuracy by an average of 6% to 33% depending on baseline ML accuracy,
while relative reduction in test set error exceeded 50% for higher baseline
accuracy ML models. These results indicate the potential value of BNN-inspired
feature generators in the ML context.
"
1260,Driven tabu search: a quantum inherent optimisation,"  Quantum computers are different from binary digital electronic computers
based on transistors. Common digital computing encodes the data into binary
digits (bits), each of which is always in one of two definite states (0 or 1),
quantum computation uses quantum bits (qubits). A circuit-based qubit quantum
computer exists and is available for experiments via cloud, the IBM quantum
experience project. We implemented a Quantum Tabu Search in order to obtain a
quantum combinatorial optimisation, suggesting that an
entanglement-metaheuristic can display optimal solutions and accelerate the
optimisation process by using entangled states. We show by building optimal
coupling maps that the distribution of our results gave similar shape as shown
previous results in an existing teleport circuit. Our research aims to find
which graph of coupling better matches a quantum circuit.
"
1261,2DR: Towards Fine-Grained 2-D RFID Touch Sensing,"  In this paper, we introduce 2DR, a single RFID tag which can seamlessly sense
two-dimensional human touch using off-the-shelf RFID readers. Instead of using
a two-dimensional tag array to sense human finger touch on a surface, 2DR only
uses one or two RFID chip(s), which reduces the manufacturing cost and makes
the tag more suitable for printing on flexible materials. The key idea behind
2DR is to design a custom-shape antenna and classify human finger touch based
on unique phase information using statistical learning. We printed 2DR tag on
FR-4 substrate and use off-the-shelf UHF-RFID readers (FCC frequency band) to
sense different touch activities. Experiments show great potential of our
design. Moreover, 2DR can be further extended to 3D by building stereoscopic
model.
"
1262,MemComputing Integer Linear Programming,"  Integer linear programming (ILP) encompasses a very important class of
optimization problems that are of great interest to both academia and industry.
Several algorithms are available that attempt to explore the solution space of
this class efficiently, while requiring a reasonable compute time. However,
although these algorithms have reached various degrees of success over the
years, they still face considerable challenges when confronted with
particularly hard problem instances, such as those of the MIPLIB 2010 library.
In this work we propose a radically different non-algorithmic approach to ILP
based on a novel physics-inspired computing paradigm: Memcomputing. This
paradigm is based on digital (hence scalable) machines represented by
appropriate electrical circuits with memory. These machines can be either built
in hardware or, as we do here, their equations of motion can be efficiently
simulated on our traditional computers. We first describe a new circuit
architecture of memcomputing machines specifically designed to solve for the
linear inequalities representing a general ILP problem. We call these
self-organizing algebraic circuits, since they self-organize dynamically to
satisfy the correct (algebraic) linear inequalities. We then show simulations
of these machines using MATLAB running on a single core of a Xeon processor for
several ILP benchmark problems taken from the MIPLIB 2010 library, and compare
our results against a renowned commercial solver. We show that our approach is
very efficient when dealing with these hard problems. In particular, we find
within minutes feasible solutions for one of these hard problems (f2000 from
MIPLIB 2010) whose feasibility, to the best of our knowledge, has remained
unknown for the past eight years.
"
1263,"Learning in Memristive Neural Network Architectures using Analog
  Backpropagation Circuits","  The on-chip implementation of learning algorithms would speed-up the training
of neural networks in crossbar arrays. The circuit level design and
implementation of backpropagation algorithm using gradient descent operation
for neural network architectures is an open problem. In this paper, we proposed
the analog backpropagation learning circuits for various memristive learning
architectures, such as Deep Neural Network (DNN), Binary Neural Network (BNN),
Multiple Neural Network (MNN), Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) and
Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM). The circuit design and verification is done
using TSMC 180nm CMOS process models, and TiO2 based memristor models. The
application level validations of the system are done using XOR problem, MNIST
character and Yale face image databases
"
1264,"RxNN: A Framework for Evaluating Deep Neural Networks on Resistive
  Crossbars","  Resistive crossbars designed with non-volatile memory devices have emerged as
promising building blocks for Deep Neural Network (DNN) hardware, due to their
ability to compactly and efficiently realize vector-matrix multiplication
(VMM), the dominant computational kernel in DNNs. However, a key challenge with
resistive crossbars is that they suffer from a range of device and circuit
level non-idealities such as interconnect parasitics, peripheral circuits,
sneak paths, and process variations. These non-idealities can lead to errors in
VMMs, eventually degrading the DNN's accuracy. It is therefore critical to
study the impact of crossbar non-idealities on the accuracy of large-scale
DNNs. However, this is challenging because existing device and circuit models
are too slow to use in application-level evaluations.
  We present RxNN, a fast and accurate simulation framework to evaluate
large-scale DNNs on resistive crossbar systems. RxNN splits and maps the
computations involved in each DNN layer into crossbar operations, and evaluates
them using a Fast Crossbar Model (FCM) that accurately captures the errors
arising due to crossbar non-idealities while being four-to-five orders of
magnitude faster than circuit simulation. FCM models a crossbar-based VMM
operation using three stages - non-linear models for the input and output
peripheral circuits (DACs and ADCs), and an equivalent non-ideal conductance
matrix for the core crossbar array. We implement RxNN by extending the Caffe
machine learning framework and use it to evaluate a suite of six large-scale
DNNs developed for the ImageNet Challenge. Our experiments reveal that
resistive crossbar non-idealities can lead to significant accuracy degradations
(9.6%-32%) for these large-scale DNNs. To the best of our knowledge, this work
is the first quantitative evaluation of the accuracy of large-scale DNNs on
resistive crossbar based hardware.
"
1265,Programmable Memristive Threshold Logic Gate Array,"  This paper proposes the implementation of programmable threshold logic gate
(TLG) crossbar array based on modified TLG cells for high speed processing and
computation. The proposed TLG array operation does not depend on input signal
and time pulses, comparing to the existing architectures. The circuit is
implemented using TSMC $180nm$ CMOS technology. The on-chip area and power
dissipation of the simulated $3\times 4$ TLG array is $1463 \mu m^2$ and $425
\mu W$, respectively.
"
1266,"Channel Characterization for Chip-scale Wireless Communications within
  Computing Packages","  Wireless Network-on-Chip (WNoC) appears as a promising alternative to
conventional interconnect fabrics for chip-scale communications. WNoC takes
advantage of an overlaid network composed by a set of millimeter-wave antennas
to reduce latency and increase throughput in the communication between cores.
Similarly, wireless inter-chip communication has been also proposed to improve
the information transfer between processors, memory, and accelerators in
multi-chip settings. However, the wireless channel remains largely unknown in
both scenarios, especially in the presence of realistic chip packages. This
work addresses the issue by accurately modeling flip-chip packages and
investigating the propagation both its interior and its surroundings. Through
parametric studies, package configurations that minimize path loss are obtained
and the trade-offs observed when applying such optimizations are discussed.
Single-chip and multi-chip architectures are compared in terms of the path loss
exponent, confirming that the amount of bulk silicon found in the pathway
between transmitter and receiver is the main determinant of losses.

1267,"A Novel A Priori Simulation Algorithm for Absorbing Receivers in
  Diffusion-Based Molecular Communication Systems","  A novel a priori Monte Carlo (APMC) algorithm is proposed to accurately
simulate the molecules absorbed at spherical receiver(s) with low computational
complexity in diffusion-based molecular communication (MC) systems. It is
demonstrated that the APMC algorithm achieves high simulation efficiency since
by using this algorithm, the fraction of molecules absorbed for a relatively
large time step length precisely matches the analytical result. Therefore, the
APMC algorithm overcomes the shortcoming of the existing refined Monte Carlo
(RMC) algorithm which enables accurate simulation for a relatively small time
step length only. Moreover, for the RMC algorithm, an expression is proposed to
quickly predict the simulation accuracy as a function of the time step length
and system parameters, which facilitates the choice of simulation time step for
a given system. Furthermore, a rejection threshold is proposed for both the RMC
and APMC algorithms to significantly save computational complexity while
causing an extremely small loss in accuracy.

1268,"On the predictive power of database classifiers formed by a small
  network of interacting chemical oscillators","  The predictive ability of database classifiers constructed with a network of
interacting chemical oscillators is studied. Databases considered here are
composed of records, where each record contains a number of parameters
(predictors) characterizing the case and the output variable describing the
case type. In a series of recent papers we have discussed the top-down design
of database classifiers, that return output information as the number of
excitations observed at a selected droplet of the network. The design is based
on an evolutionary algorithm that optimizes the network to achieve maximum
mutual information between the network evolution and the record types. Here we
discuss results illustrating that such classifiers do have a predicting
ability. They are able to give a correct classification for database records
that are not included into the process of classifier training. As example
databases we consider points inside a multidimensional unit cube and test if
they belong to a ball located at the mid of cube.

1269,"RASSA: Resistive Pre-Alignment Accelerator for Approximate DNA Long Read
  Mapping","  DNA read mapping is a computationally expensive bioinformatics task, required
for genome assembly and consensus polishing. It requires to find the
best-fitting location for each DNA read on a long reference sequence. A novel
resistive approximate similarity search accelerator, RASSA, exploits charge
distribution and parallel in-memory processing to reflect a mismatch count
between DNA sequences. RASSA implementation of DNA long read pre-alignment
outperforms the state-of-art solution, minimap2, by 16-77x with comparable
accuracy and provides two orders of magnitude higher throughput than
GateKeeper, a short-read pre-alignment hardware architecture implemented in
FPGA.

1270,"Magic-State Functional Units: Mapping and Scheduling Multi-Level
  Distillation Circuits for Fault-Tolerant Quantum Architectures","  Quantum computers have recently made great strides and are on a long-term
path towards useful fault-tolerant computation. A dominant overhead in
fault-tolerant quantum computation is the production of high-fidelity encoded
qubits, called magic states, which enable reliable error-corrected computation.
We present the first detailed designs of hardware functional units that
implement space-time optimized magic-state factories for surface code
error-corrected machines. Interactions among distant qubits require surface
code braids (physical pathways on chip) which must be routed. Magic-state
factories are circuits comprised of a complex set of braids that is more
difficult to route than quantum circuits considered in previous work [1]. This
paper explores the impact of scheduling techniques, such as gate reordering and
qubit renaming, and we propose two novel mapping techniques: braid repulsion
and dipole moment braid rotation. We combine these techniques with graph
partitioning and community detection algorithms, and further introduce a
stitching algorithm for mapping subgraphs onto a physical machine. Our results
show a factor of 5.64 reduction in space-time volume compared to the best-known
previous designs for magic-state factories.
"
1271,Modeling the EM Field Distribution within a Computer Chip Package,"  Wireless Network-on-Chip (WNoC) appears as a promising alternative to
conventional interconnect fabrics for chip-scale communications. The study of
the channel inside the chip is essential to minimize latency and power.
However, this requires long and computationally-intensive simulations which
take a lot of time. We propose and implement an analytical model of the EM
propagation inside the package based on ray tracing. This model could compute
the electric field intensity inside the chip reducing the computational time
several orders of magnitude with an average mismatch of only 1.7 dB.
"
1272,Design Automation for Adiabatic Circuits,"  Adiabatic circuits are heavily investigated since they allow for computations
with an asymptotically close to zero energy dissipation per operation - serving
as an alternative technology for many scenarios where energy efficiency is
preferred over fast execution. Their concepts are motivated by the fact that
the information lost from conventional circuits results in an entropy increase
which causes energy dissipation. To overcome this issue, computations are
performed in a (conditionally) reversible fashion which, additionally, have to
satisfy switching rules that are different from conventional circuitry - crying
out for dedicated design automation solutions. While previous approaches either
focus on their electrical realization (resulting in small, hand-crafted
circuits only) or on designing fully reversible building blocks (an unnecessary
overhead), this work aims for providing an automatic and dedicated design
scheme that explicitly takes the recent findings in this domain into account.
To this end, we review the theoretical and technical background of adiabatic
circuits and present automated methods that dedicatedly realize the desired
function as an adiabatic circuit. The resulting methods are further optimized -
leading to an automatic and efficient design automation for this promising
technology. Evaluations confirm the benefits and applicability of the proposed
solution.
"
1273,The largest cognitive systems will be optoelectronic,"  Electrons and photons offer complementary strengths for information
processing. Photons are excellent for communication, while electrons are
superior for computation and memory. Cognition requires distributed computation
to be communicated across the system for information integration. We present
reasoning from neuroscience, network theory, and device physics supporting the
conjecture that large-scale cognitive systems will benefit from electronic
devices performing synaptic, dendritic, and neuronal information processing
operating in conjunction with photonic communication. On the chip scale,
integrated dielectric waveguides enable fan-out to thousands of connections. On
the system scale, fiber and free-space optics can be employed. The largest
cognitive systems will be limited by the distance light can travel during the
period of a network oscillation. We calculate that optoelectronic networks the
area of a large data center ($10^5$\,m$^2$) will be capable of system-wide
information integration at $1$\,MHz. At frequencies of cortex-wide integration
in the human brain ($4$\,Hz, theta band), optoelectronic systems could
integrate information across the surface of the earth.
"
1274,Tackling the Qubit Mapping Problem for NISQ-Era Quantum Devices,"  Due to little consideration in the hardware constraints, e.g., limited
connections between physical qubits to enable two-qubit gates, most quantum
algorithms cannot be directly executed on the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum
(NISQ) devices. Dynamically remapping logical qubits to physical qubits in the
compiler is needed to enable the two-qubit gates in the algorithm, which
introduces additional operations and inevitably reduces the fidelity of the
algorithm. Previous solutions in finding such remapping suffer from high
complexity, poor initial mapping quality, and limited flexibility and
controllability.
  To address these drawbacks mentioned above, this paper proposes a SWAP-based
BidiREctional heuristic search algorithm SABRE, which is applicable to NISQ
devices with arbitrary connections between qubits. By optimizing every search
attempt,globally optimizing the initial mapping using a novel reverse traversal
technique, introducing the decay effect to enable the trade-off between the
depth and the number of gates of the entire algorithm, SABRE outperforms the
best known algorithm with exponential speedup and comparable or better results
on various benchmarks.
"
1275,Reservoir Computing based Neural Image Filters,"  Clean images are an important requirement for machine vision systems to
recognize visual features correctly. However, the environment, optics,
electronics of the physical imaging systems can introduce extreme distortions
and noise in the acquired images. In this work, we explore the use of reservoir
computing, a dynamical neural network model inspired from biological systems,
in creating dynamic image filtering systems that extracts signal from noise
using inverse modeling. We discuss the possibility of implementing these
networks in hardware close to the sensors.
"
1276,"Memristive LSTM network hardware architecture for time-series predictive
  modeling problem","  Analysis of time-series data allows to identify long-term trends and make
predictions that can help to improve our lives. With the rapid development of
artificial neural networks, long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural
network (RNN) configuration is found to be capable in dealing with time-series
forecasting problems where data points are time-dependent and possess
seasonality trends. Gated structure of LSTM cell and flexibility in network
topology (one-to-many, many-to-one, etc.) allows to model systems with multiple
input variables and control several parameters such as the size of the
look-back window to make a prediction and number of time steps to be predicted.
These make LSTM attractive tool over conventional methods such as
autoregression models, the simple average, moving average, naive approach,
ARIMA, Holt's linear trend method, Holt's Winter seasonal method, and others.
In this paper, we propose a hardware implementation of LSTM network
architecture for time-series forecasting problem. All simulations were
performed using TSMC 0.18um CMOS technology and HP memristor model.
"
1277,Qiskit Backend Specifications for OpenQASM and OpenPulse Experiments,"  As interest in quantum computing grows, there is a pressing need for
standardized API's so that algorithm designers, circuit designers, and
physicists can be provided a common reference frame for designing, executing,
and optimizing experiments. There is also a need for a language specification
that goes beyond gates and allows users to specify the time dynamics of a
quantum experiment and recover the time dynamics of the output. In this
document we provide a specification for a common interface to backends
(simulators and experiments) and a standarized data structure (Qobj --- quantum
object) for sending experiments to those backends via Qiskit. We also introduce
OpenPulse, a language for specifying pulse level control (i.e. control of the
continuous time dynamics) of a general quantum device independent of the
specific hardware implementation.
"
1278,"SpRRAM: A Predefined Sparsity Based Memristive Neuromorphic Circuit for
  Low Power Application","  In this paper, we propose an efficient predefined structured sparsity-based
ex-situ training framework for a hybrid CMOS-memristive neuromorphic hardware
for deep neural network to significantly lower the power consumption and
computational complexity and improve scalability. The structure is verified on
a wide range of datasets including MNIST handwritten recognition, breast cancer
prediction, and mobile health monitoring. The results of this study show that
compared to its fully connected version, the proposed structure provides
significant power reduction while maintaining high classification accuracy.
"
1279,p-Bits for Probabilistic Spin Logic,"  We introduce the concept of a probabilistic or p-bit, intermediate between
the standard bits of digital electronics and the emerging q-bits of quantum
computing. We show that low barrier magnets or LBM's provide a natural physical
representation for p-bits and can be built either from perpendicular magnets
(PMA) designed to be close to the in-plane transition or from circular in-plane
magnets (IMA). Magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJ) built using LBM's as free layers
can be combined with standard NMOS transistors to provide three-terminal
building blocks for large scale probabilistic circuits that can be designed to
perform useful functions. Interestingly, this three-terminal unit looks just
like the 1T/MTJ device used in embedded MRAM technology, with only one
difference: the use of an LBM for the MTJ free layer. We hope that the concept
of p-bits and p-circuits will help open up new application spaces for this
emerging technology. However, a p-bit need not involve an MTJ, any fluctuating
resistor could be combined with a transistor to implement it, while completely
digital implementations using conventional CMOS technology are also possible.
The p-bit also provides a conceptual bridge between two active but disjoint
fields of research, namely stochastic machine learning and quantum computing.
First, there are the applications that are based on the similarity of a p-bit
to the binary stochastic neuron (BSN), a well-known concept in machine
learning. Three-terminal p-bits could provide an efficient hardware accelerator
for the BSN. Second, there are the applications that are based on the p-bit
being like a poor man's q-bit. Initial demonstrations based on full SPICE
simulations show that several optimization problems including quantum annealing
are amenable to p-bit implementations which can be scaled up at room
temperature using existing technology.
"
1280,Exploring More-Coherent Quantum Annealing,"  In the quest to reboot computing, quantum annealing (QA) is an interesting
candidate for a new capability. While it has not demonstrated an advantage over
classical computing on a real-world application, many important regions of the
QA design space have yet to be explored. In IARPA's Quantum Enhanced
Optimization (QEO) program, we have opened some new lines of inquiry to get to
the heart of QA, and are designing testbed superconducting circuits and
conducting key experiments. In this paper, we discuss recent experimental
progress related to one of the key design dimensions: qubit coherence. Using
MIT Lincoln Laboratory's qubit fabrication process and extending recent
progress in flux qubits, we are implementing and measuring QA-capable flux
qubits. Achieving high coherence in a QA context presents significant new
engineering challenges. We report on techniques and preliminary measurement
results addressing two of the challenges: crosstalk calibration and qubit
readout. This groundwork enables exploration of other promising features and
provides a path to understanding the physics and the viability of quantum
annealing as a computing resource.
"
1281,"A scalable method to find the shortest path in a graph with circuits of
  memristors","  Finding the shortest path in a graph has applications to a wide range of
optimization problems. However, algorithmic methods scale with the size of the
graph in terms of time and energy. We propose a method to solve the shortest
path problem using circuits of nanodevices called memristors and validate it on
graphs of different sizes and topologies. It is both valid for an
experimentally derived memristor model and robust to device variability. The
time and energy of the computation scale with the length of the shortest path
rather than with the size of the graph, making this method particularly
attractive for solving large graphs with small path lengths.
"
1282,"High-Accuracy Inference in Neuromorphic Circuits using Hardware-Aware
  Training","  Neuromorphic Multiply-And-Accumulate (MAC) circuits utilizing synaptic weight
elements based on SRAM or novel Non-Volatile Memories (NVMs) provide a
promising approach for highly efficient hardware representations of neural
networks. NVM density and robustness requirements suggest that off-line
training is the right choice for ""edge"" devices, since the requirements for
synapse precision are much less stringent. However, off-line training using
ideal mathematical weights and activations can result in significant loss of
inference accuracy when applied to non-ideal hardware. Non-idealities such as
multi-bit quantization of weights and activations, non-linearity of weights,
finite max/min ratios of NVM elements, and asymmetry of positive and negative
weight components all result in degraded inference accuracy. In this work, it
is demonstrated that non-ideal Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) architectures using
low bitwidth weights and activations can be trained with negligible loss of
inference accuracy relative to their Floating Point-trained counterparts using
a proposed off-line, continuously differentiable HW-aware training algorithm.
The proposed algorithm is applicable to a wide range of hardware models, and
uses only standard neural network training methods. The algorithm is
demonstrated on the MNIST and EMNIST datasets, using standard MLPs.
"
1283,Exploiting Errors for Efficiency: A Survey from Circuits to Algorithms,"  When a computational task tolerates a relaxation of its specification or when
an algorithm tolerates the effects of noise in its execution, hardware,
programming languages, and system software can trade deviations from correct
behavior for lower resource usage. We present, for the first time, a synthesis
of research results on computing systems that only make as many errors as their
users can tolerate, from across the disciplines of computer aided design of
circuits, digital system design, computer architecture, programming languages,
operating systems, and information theory.
  Rather than over-provisioning resources at each layer to avoid errors, it can
be more efficient to exploit the masking of errors occurring at one layer which
can prevent them from propagating to a higher layer. We survey tradeoffs for
individual layers of computing systems from the circuit level to the operating
system level and illustrate the potential benefits of end-to-end approaches
using two illustrative examples. To tie together the survey, we present a
consistent formalization of terminology, across the layers, which does not
significantly deviate from the terminology traditionally used by research
communities in their layer of focus.
"
1284,"Performance Analysis of Molecular Spatial Modulation (MSM) in Diffusion
  based Molecular MIMO Communication Systems","  In diffusion-based molecular communication, information is transferred from a
transmitter to a receiver using molecular carriers. The low achievable data
rate is the main disadvantage of diffusion-based molecular over radio-based
communication. One solution to overcome this disadvantage is molecular MIMO
communication. In this paper, we introduce molecular spatial modulation (MSM)
in molecular MIMO communication to increase the data rate of the system. Also,
special detection methods are used, all of which are based on the threshold
level detection method. They use diversity techniques in molecular
communication systems if the channel matrix that we introduce is full rank.
Also, for a 2$\times$1 system, we define an optimization problem to obtain the
suitable number of molecules for transmitting to reduce BER of this systems.
Then the proposed modulation is generalized to $2\times2$ and $4\times4$
systems. In each of these systems, special detection methods based on the
threshold level detection are used. Finally, based on BER, systems using MSM
are fairly compared to the systems that have similar data rates. The simulation
results show that the proposed modulation and detection methods reduce BER.
Whereas the proposed methods are very simple and practical for molecular
systems.
"
1285,"The Impact of On-chip Communication on Memory Technologies for
  Neuromorphic Systems","  Emergent nanoscale non-volatile memory technologies with high integration
density offer a promising solution to overcome the scalability limitations of
CMOS-based neural networks architectures, by efficiently exhibiting the key
principle of neural computation. Despite the potential improvements in
computational costs, designing high-performance on-chip communication networks
that support flexible, large-fanout connectivity remains as daunting task. In
this paper, we elaborate on the communication requirements of large-scale
neuromorphic designs, and point out the differences with the conventional
network-on-chip architectures. We present existing approaches for on-chip
neuromorphic routing networks, and discuss how new memory and integration
technologies may help to alleviate the communication issues in constructing
next-generation intelligent computing machines.
"
1286,"Computing Wasserstein Distance for Persistence Diagrams on a Quantum
  Computer","  Persistence diagrams are a useful tool from topological data analysis which
can be used to provide a concise description of a filtered topological space.
What makes them even more useful in practice is that they come with a notion of
a metric, the Wasserstein distance (closely related to but not the same as the
homonymous metric from probability theory). Further, this metric provides a
notion of stability; that is, small noise in the input causes at worst small
differences in the output. In this paper, we show that the Wasserstein distance
for persistence diagrams can be computed through quantum annealing. We provide
a formulation of the problem as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization
problem, or QUBO, and prove correctness. Finally, we test our algorithm,
exploring parameter choices and problem size capabilities, using a D-Wave 2000Q
quantum annealing computer.
"
1287,"The Effective Geometry Monte Carlo Algorithm: Applications to Molecular
  Communication","  In this work, we address the systematic biases and random errors stemming
from finite step sizes encountered in diffusion simulations. We introduce the
Effective Geometry Monte Carlo (EG-MC) simulation algorithm which modifies the
geometry of the receiver. We motivate our approach in a 1D toy model and then
apply our findings to a spherical absorbing receiver in a 3D unbounded
environment. We show that with minimal computational cost, the impulse response
of this receiver can be precisely simulated using EG-MC. Afterwards, we
demonstrate the accuracy of our simulations and give tight constraints on the
single free parameter in EG-MC. Finally, we comment on the range of
applicability of our results. While we present the EG-MC algorithm for the
specific case of molecular diffusion, we believe that analogous methods with
effective geometry manipulations can be utilized to approach a variety of
problems in other branches of physics such as condensed matter physics and
cosmological large scale structure simulations.
"
1288,CRN++: Molecular Programming Language,"  Synthetic biology is a rapidly emerging research area, with expected
wide-ranging impact in biology, nanofabrication, and medicine. A key technical
challenge lies in embedding computation in molecular contexts where electronic
micro-controllers cannot be inserted. This necessitates effective
representation of computation using molecular components. While previous work
established the Turing-completeness of chemical reactions, defining
representations that are faithful, efficient, and practical remains
challenging. This paper introduces CRN++, a new language for programming
deterministic (mass-action) chemical kinetics to perform computation. We
present its syntax and semantics, and build a compiler translating CRN++
programs into chemical reactions, thereby laying the foundation of a
comprehensive framework for molecular programming. Our language addresses the
key challenge of embedding familiar imperative constructs into a set of
chemical reactions happening simultaneously and manipulating real-valued
concentrations. Although some deviation from ideal output value cannot be
avoided, we develop methods to minimize the error, and implement error analysis
tools. We demonstrate the feasibility of using CRN++ on a suite of well-known
algorithms for discrete and real-valued computation. CRN++ can be easily
extended to support new commands or chemical reaction implementations, and thus
provides a foundation for developing more robust and practical molecular
programs.
"
1289,"Biological plausibility and stochasticity in scalable VO2 active
  memristor neurons","  Neuromorphic networks of artificial neurons and synapses can solve
computational hard problems with energy efficiencies unattainable for von
Neumann architectures. For image processing, silicon neuromorphic processors
outperform graphic processing units (GPUs) in energy efficiency by a large
margin, but they deliver much lower chip-scale throughput. The
performance-efficiency dilemma for silicon processors may not be overcome by
Moore's law scaling of complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS)
field-effect transistors. Scalable and biomimetic active memristor neurons and
passive memristor synapses form a self-sufficient basis for a transistorless
neural network. However, previous demonstrations of memristor neurons only
showed simple integrate-and-fire (I&F) behaviors and did not reveal the rich
dynamics and computational complexity of biological neurons. Here we show that
neurons built with nanoscale vanadium dioxide active memristors possess all
three classes of excitability and most of the known biological neuronal
dynamics, and are intrinsically stochastic. With the favorable size and power
scaling, there is a path toward an all-memristor neuromorphic cortical
computer.
"
1290,"Hierarchical System Mapping for Large-Scale Fault-Tolerant Quantum
  Computing","  Considering the large-scale quantum computer, it is important to know how
much quantum computational resources is necessary precisely and quickly.
Unfortunately the previous methods so far cannot support a large-scale quantum
computing practically and therefore the analysis because they usually use a
non-structured code. To overcome this problem, we propose a fast mapping by
using the hierarchical assembly code which is much more compact than the
non-structured code. During the mapping process, the necessary modules and
their interconnection can be dynamically mapped by using the communication bus
at the cost of additional qubits. In our study, the proposed method works very
fast such as 1 hour than 1500 days for Shor algorithm to factorize 512-bit
integer. Meanwhile, since the hierarchical assembly code has high degree of
locality, it has shorter SWAP chains and hence it does not increase the quantum
computation time than expected.
"
1291,"Crossbar-Constrained Technology Mapping for ReRAM based In-Memory
  Computing","  In recent times, Resistive RAMs (ReRAMs) have gained significant prominence
due to their unique feature of supporting both non-volatile storage and logic
capabilities. ReRAM is also reported to provide extremely low power consumption
compared to the standard CMOS storage devices. As a result, researchers have
explored the mapping and design of diverse applications, ranging from
arithmetic to neuromorphic computing structures to ReRAM-based platforms.
ReVAMP, a general-purpose ReRAM computing platform, has been proposed recently
to leverage the parallelism exhibited in a crossbar structure. However, the
technology mapping on ReVAMP remains an open challenge. Though the technology
mapping with device/area-constraints have been proposed, crossbar constraints
are not considered so far. In this work, we address this problem. Two
technology mapping flows are proposed, considering different runtime-efficiency
trade-offs. Both the mapping flows take crossbar constraints into account and
generate feasible mapping for a variety of crossbar dimensions. Our proposed
algorithms are highly scalable and reveal important design hints for
ReRAM-based implementations.
"
1292,"Analytical Derivation of the Impulse Response for the Bounded 2-D
  Diffusion Channel","  This paper focuses on the derivation of the distribution of diffused
particles absorbed by an agent in a bounded environment. In particular, we
analogously consider to derive the impulse response of a molecular
communication channel in 2-D and 3-D environment. In 2-D, the channel involves
a point transmitter that releases molecules to a circular absorbing receiver
that absorbs incoming molecules in an environment surrounded by a circular
reflecting boundary. Considering this setup, the joint distribution of the
molecules on the circular absorbing receiver with respect to time and angle is
derived. Using this distribution, the channel characteristics are examined.
Furthermore, we also extend this channel model to 3-D using a cylindrical
receiver and investigate the channel properties. We also propose how to obtain
an analytical solution for the unbounded 2-D channel from our derived
solutions, as no analytical derivation for this channel is present in the
literature.

1293,Internet of NanoThings: Concepts and Applications,"  This chapter focuses on Internet of Things from the nanoscale point of view.
The chapter starts with section 1 which provides an introduction of nanothings
and nanotechnologies. The nanoscale communication paradigms and the different
approaches are discussed for nanodevices development. Nanodevice
characteristics are discussed and the architecture of wireless nanodevices are
outlined. Section 2 describes Internet of NanoThing(IoNT), its network
architecture, and the challenges of nanoscale communication which is essential
for enabling IoNT. Section 3 gives some practical applications of IoNT. The

discussed. Other Applications such as military, industrial, and environmental
applications are also outlined.
"
1294,T-count Optimized Quantum Circuits for Bilinear Interpolation,"  Quantum circuits for basic image processing functions such as bilinear
interpolation are required to implement image processing algorithms on quantum
computers. In this work, we propose quantum circuits for the bilinear
interpolation of NEQR encoded images based on Clifford+T gates. Quantum
circuits for the scale up operation and scale down operation are illustrated.
The proposed quantum circuits are based on quantum Clifford+T gates and are
optimized for T-count. Quantum circuits based on Clifford+T gates can be made
fault tolerant but the T gate is very costly to implement. As a result,
reducing T-count is an important optimization goal. The proposed quantum
bilinear interpolation circuits are based on (i) a quantum adder, (ii) a
proposed quantum subtractor, and (iii) a quantum multiplication circuit.
Further, both designs are compared and shown to be superior to existing work in
terms of T-count. The proposed quantum bilinear interpolation circuits for the
scale down operation and for the scale up operation each have a $92.52\%$
improvement in terms of T-count compared to the existing work.
"
1295,"Quantum Circuit Designs of Integer Division Optimizing T-count and
  T-depth","  Quantum circuits for mathematical functions such as division are necessary to
use quantum computers for scientific computing. Quantum circuits based on
Clifford+T gates can easily be made fault-tolerant but the T gate is very
costly to implement. The small number of qubits available in existing quantum
computers adds another constraint on quantum circuits. As a result, reducing
T-count and qubit cost have become important optimization goals. The design of
quantum circuits for integer division has caught the attention of researchers
and designs have been proposed in the literature. However, these designs suffer
from excessive T gate and qubit costs. Many of these designs also produce
significant garbage output resulting in additional qubit and T gate costs to
eliminate these outputs. In this work, we propose two quantum integer division
circuits. The first proposed quantum integer division circuit is based on the
restoring division algorithm and the second proposed design implements the
non-restoring division algorithm. Both proposed designs are optimized in terms
of T-count, T-depth and qubits. Both proposed quantum circuit designs are based
on (i) a quantum subtractor, (ii) a quantum adder-subtractor circuit, and (iii)
a novel quantum conditional addition circuit. Our proposed restoring division
circuit achieves average T-count savings from $79.03 \%$ to $91.69 \%$ compared
to the existing works. Our proposed non-restoring division circuit achieves
average T-count savings from $49.75 \%$ to $90.37 \%$ compared to the existing
works. Further, both our proposed designs have linear T-depth.
"
1296,"Normal Inverse Gaussian Approximation for Arrival Time Difference in
  Flow-Induced Molecular Communications","  In this paper, we consider molecular communications in one-dimensional
flow-induced diffusion channels with a perfectly absorbing receiver. In such
channels, the random propagation delay until the molecules are absorbed follows
an inverse Gaussian (IG) distribution and is referred to as first hitting time.
Knowing the distribution for the difference of the first hitting times of two
molecules is very important if the information is encoded by a limited set of
molecules and the receiver exploits their arrival time and/or order. Hence, we
propose a moment matching approximation by a normal inverse Gaussian (NIG)
distribution and we derive an expression for the asymptotic tail probability.
Numerical evaluations showed that the NIG approximation matches very well with
the exact solution obtained by numerical convolution of the IG density
functions. Moreover, the asymptotic tail probability outperforms
state-of-the-art tail approximations.

1297,"Impact of Integrated Circuit Packaging on Synaptic Dynamics of
  Memristive Devices","  The memristor can be used as non volatile memory (NVM) and for emulating
neuron behavior. It has the ability to switch between low resistance $R_{on}$
and high resistance values $R_{off}$, and exhibit the synaptic dynamic
behaviour such as potentiation and depression. This paper presents a study on
potentiation and depression of memristors in Quad Flat Pack. A comparison is
drawn between the memristors with and without the impact of parasitics of
packaging, using measured data and equivalent circuit models. The parameters in
memristor and packaging models for the SPICE simulations were determined using
measured data to reflect the memristor parasitics in Quad Flat Packs.

1298,"Wafer Quality Inspection using Memristive LSTM, ANN, DNN and HTM","  The automated wafer inspection and quality control is a complex and
time-consuming task, which can speed up using neuromorphic memristive
architectures, as a separate inspection device or integrating directly into
sensors. This paper presents the performance analysis and comparison of
different neuromorphic architectures for patterned wafer quality inspection and
classification. The application of non-volatile memristive devices in these
architectures ensures low power consumption, small on-chip area scalability. We
demonstrate that Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) outperforms other architectures
for the same number of training iterations, and has relatively low on-chip area
and power consumption.
"
1299,Optimization of Circuits for IBM's five-qubit Quantum Computers,"  IBM has made several quantum computers available to researchers around the
world via cloud services. Two architectures with five qubits, one with 16, and
one with 20 qubits are available to run experiments. The IBM architectures
implement gates from the Clifford+T gate library. However, each architecture
only implements a subset of the possible CNOT gates. In this paper, we show how
Clifford+T circuits can efficiently be mapped into the two IBM quantum
computers with 5 qubits. We further present an algorithm and a set of circuit
identities that may be used to optimize the Clifford+T circuits in terms of
gate count and number of levels. It is further shown that the optimized
circuits can considerably reduce the gate count and number of levels and thus
produce results with better fidelity.

  Flux Quantum Logic Circuits","  In this paper, a new graph partitioning problem is introduced. The depth of
each part is constrained, i.e., the node count in the longest path of the
corresponding sub-graph is no more than a predetermined positive integer value
p. An additional constraint is enforced such that each part contains only nodes
selected from consecutive levels in the graph. The problem is therefore
transformed into a Depth-bounded Levelized Graph Partitioning (DLGP) problem,
which is solved optimally using a dynamic programming algorithm. As an example
application, we have shown that DLGP can effectively generate timing-correct
circuit solutions for Single Flux Quantum (SFQ) logic, which is a
magnetic-pulse-based, gate-level pipelined superconductive computing fabric.
Experimental results confirm that DLGP generates circuits with considerably
lower path balancing overheads compared with a baseline full-path-balancing
approach. For example, the balancing overhead (a critical measure of quality
metric) for the SFQ circuit realization in terms of D-Flip-Flop count is
reduced by 3.61 times on average for 10 benchmark circuit, given p=5.
"
1301,Using Hoare logic for quantum circuit optimization,"  By employing quantum mechanical phenomena such as superposition,
entanglement, and interference, quantum computers promise to perform certain
computations exponentially faster than any classical device. Precise control
over these physical systems and proper shielding from unwanted interactions
with the environment become more difficult as the space/time volume of the
computation grows. Code optimization is thus crucial in order to reduce
resource requirements to the greatest extent possible. Besides manual
optimization, previous work has successfully adapted classical methods such as
constant-folding and common subexpression elimination to the quantum domain.
However, such classically-inspired methods fail to exploit certain optimization
opportunities that arise due to entanglement. To address this insufficiency, we
introduce an optimization methodology which employs Hoare triples in order to
identify and exploit these optimization opportunities. We implement the
optimizer using the Z3 Theorem Prover and the ProjectQ software framework for
quantum computing and show that it is able to reduce the circuit area of our
benchmarks by up to 5x.
"
1302,Advanced Simulation of Droplet Microfluidics,"  The complexity of droplet microfluidics grows by implementing parallel
processes and multiple functionalities on a single device. This poses a
challenge to the engineer designing the microfluidic networks. In today's
design processes, the engineer relies on calculations, assumptions,
simplifications, as well as his/her experiences and intuitions. In order to
validate the obtained specification of the microfluidic network, usually a
prototype is fabricated and physical experiments are conducted thus far. In
case the design does not implement the desired functionality, this prototyping
iteration is repeated - obviously resulting in an expensive and time-consuming
design process. In order to avoid unnecessary prototyping loops, simulation
methods could help to validate the specification of the microfluidic network
before any prototype is fabricated. However, state-of-the-art simulation tools
come with severe limitations, which prevent their utilization for
practically-relevant applications. More precisely, they are often not dedicated
to droplet microfluidics, cannot handle the required physical phenomena, are
not publicly available, and can hardly be extended. In this work, we present an
advanced simulation approach for droplet microfluidics which addresses these
shortcomings and, eventually, allows to simulate practically-relevant
applications. To this end, we propose a simulation framework which directly
works on the specification of the design, supports essential physical
phenomena, is publicly available, and easy to extend. Evaluations and case
studies demonstrate the benefits of the proposed simulator: While current
state-of-the-art tools were not applicable for practically-relevant
microfluidic networks, the proposed solution allows to reduce the design time
and costs e.g. of a drug screening device from one person month and USD 1200,
respectively, to just a fraction of that.
"
1303,"Synthesis of Majority Expressions through Primitive Function
  Manipulation","  Due to technology advancements and circuits miniaturization, the study of
logic systems that can be applied to nanotechnology has been progressing
steadily. Among the creation of nanoeletronic circuits reversible and majority
logic stand out. This paper proposes the MPC (Majority Primitives Combination)
algorithm, used for majority logic synthesis. The algorithm receives a truth
table as input and returns a majority function that covers the same set of
minterms. The formulation of a valid output function is made with the
combination of previously optimized functions. As cost criteria the algorithm
searches for a function with the least number of levels, followed by the least
number of gates, inverters, and gate inputs. In this paper it's also presented
a comparison between the MPC and the exact_mig, currently considered the best
algorithm for majority synthesis. The exact_mig encode the exact synthesis of
majority functions using the number of levels and gates as cost criteria. The
MPC considers two additional cost criteria, the number of inverters and the
number of gate inputs, with the goal to further improve exact_mig results.
Tests have shown that both algorithms return optimal solutions for all
functions with 3 input variables. For functions with 4 inputs, the MPC is able
to further improve 42,987 (66%) functions and achieves equal results for 7,198
(11%). For functions with 5 input variables, out of a sample of 1,000 randomly
generated functions, the MPC further improved 477 (48%) functions and achieved
equal results for 112 (11%).
"
1304,Memristor-based Deep Convolution Neural Network: A Case Study,"  In this paper, we firstly introduce a method to efficiently implement
large-scale high-dimensional convolution with realistic memristor-based circuit
components. An experiment verified simulator is adapted for accurate prediction
of analog crossbar behavior. An improved conversion algorithm is developed to
convert convolution kernels to memristor-based circuits, which minimizes the
error with consideration of the data and kernel patterns in CNNs. With circuit
simulation for all convolution layers in ResNet-20, we found that 8-bit ADC/DAC
is necessary to preserve software level classification accuracy.
"
1305,Practical Implementation of Memristor-Based Threshold Logic Gates,"  Current advances in emerging memory technologies enable novel and
unconventional computing architectures for high-performance and low-power
electronic systems, capable of carrying out massively parallel operations at
the edge. One emerging technology, ReRAM, also known to belong in the family of
memristors (memory resistors), is gathering attention due to its attractive
features for logic and in-memory computing; benefits which follow from its
technological attributes, such as nanoscale dimensions, low power operation and
multi-state programming. At the same time, design with CMOS is quickly reaching
its physical and functional limitations, and further research towards novel
logic families, such as Threshold Logic Gates (TLGs) is scoped. TLGs constitute
a logic family known for its high-speed and low power consumption, yet rely on
conventional transistor technology. Introducing memristors enables a more
affordable reconfiguration capability of TLGs. Through this work, we are
introducing a physical implementation of a memristor-based current-mode TLG
(MCMTLG) circuit and validate its design and operation through multiple
experimental setups. We demonstrate 2-input and 3-input MCMTLG configurations
and showcase their reconfiguration capability. This is achieved by varying
memristive weights arbitrarily for shaping the classification decision
boundary, thus showing promise as an alternative hardware-friendly
implementation of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). Through the employment of
real memristor devices as the equivalent of synaptic weights in TLGs, we are
realizing components that can be used towards an in-silico classifier.
"
1306,Training Passive Photonic Reservoirs with Integrated Optical Readout,"  As Moore's law comes to an end, neuromorphic approaches to computing are on
the rise. One of these, passive photonic reservoir computing, is a strong
candidate for computing at high bitrates (> 10 Gbps) and with low energy
consumption. Currently though, both benefits are limited by the necessity to
perform training and readout operations in the electrical domain. Thus, efforts
are currently underway in the photonic community to design an integrated
optical readout, which allows to perform all operations in the optical domain.
In addition to the technological challenge of designing such a readout, new
algorithms have to be designed in order to train it. Foremost, suitable
algorithms need to be able to deal with the fact that the actual on-chip
reservoir states are not directly observable. In this work, we investigate
several options for such a training algorithm and propose a solution in which
the complex states of the reservoir can be observed by appropriately setting
the readout weights, while iterating over a predefined input sequence. We
perform numerical simulations in order to compare our method with an ideal
baseline requiring full observability as well as with an established black-box
optimization approach (CMA-ES).

1307,"Constant Time Quantum search Algorithm Over A Datasets: An Experimental
  Study Using IBM Q Experience","  In this work, a constant time Quantum searching algorithm over a datasets is
proposed and subsequently the algorithm is executed in real chip quantum
computer developed by IBM Quantum experience (IBMQ). QISKit, the software
platform developed by IBM is used for this algorithm implementation. Quantum
interference, Quantum superposition and {\pi} phase shift of quantum state
applied for this constant time search algorithm. The proposed quantum algorithm
is executed in QISKit SDK local backend 'local_qasm_simulator', real chip
'ibmq_16_melbourne' and 'ibmqx4' IBMQ. Result also suggest that real chip
ibmq_16_melbourne is more quantum error or noise prone than ibmqx4.
"
1308,"Taming a non-convex landscape with dynamical long-range order:
  memcomputing Ising benchmarks","  Recent work on quantum annealing has emphasized the role of collective
behavior in solving optimization problems. By enabling transitions of clusters
of variables, such solvers are able to navigate their state space and locate
solutions more efficiently despite having only local connections between
elements. However, collective behavior is not exclusive to quantum annealers,
and classical solvers that display collective dynamics should also possess an
advantage in navigating a non-convex landscape. Here, we give evidence that a
benchmark derived from quantum annealing studies is solvable in polynomial time
using digital memcomputing machines, which utilize a collection of dynamical
components with memory to represent the structure of the underlying
optimization problem. To illustrate the role of memory and clarify the
structure of these solvers we propose a simple model of these machines that
demonstrates the emergence of long-range order. This model, when applied to
finding the ground state of the Ising frustrated-loop benchmarks, undergoes a
transient phase of avalanches which can span the entire lattice and
demonstrates a connection between long-range behavior and their probability of
success. These results establish the advantages of computational approaches
based on collective dynamics of continuous dynamical systems.
"
1309,Structured decomposition for reversible Boolean functions,"  Reversible Boolean function is a one-to-one function which maps $n$-bit input
to $n$-bit output. Reversible logic synthesis has been widely studied due to
its relationship with low-energy computation as well as quantum computation. In
this work, we give a structured decomposition for even reversible Boolean
functions (RBF). Specifically, for $n\geq 6$, any even $n$-bit RBF can be
decomposed to $7$ blocks of $(n-1)$-bit RBF, where $7$ is a constant
independent of $n$; and the positions of those blocks have large degree of
freedom. Moreover, if the $(n-1)$-bit RBFs are required to be even as well, we
show for $n\geq 10$, $n$-bit RBF can be decomposed to $10$ even $(n-1)$-bit
RBFs. For simplicity, we say our decomposition has block depth $7$ and even
block depth $10$.
  Our result improves Selinger's work in block depth model, by reducing the
constant from $9$ to $7$; and from $13$ to $10$ when the blocks are limited to
be even. We emphasize that our setting is a bit different from Selinger's. In
Selinger's constructive proof, each block is one of two specific positions and
thus the decomposition has an alternating structure. We relax this restriction
and allow each block to act on arbitrary $(n-1)$ bits. This relaxation keeps
the block structure and provides more candidates when choosing positions of
blocks.
"
1310,Stochastic Synthesis for Stochastic Computing,"  Stochastic computing (SC) is an emerging computing technique which offers
higher computational density, and lower power over binary-encoded (BE)
computation. Unlike BE computation, SC encodes values as probabilistic
bitstreams which makes designing new circuits unintuitive. Existing techniques
for synthesizing SC circuits are limited to specific classes of functions such
as polynomial evaluation or constant scaling. In this paper, we propose using
stochastic synthesis, which is originally a program synthesis technique, to
automate the task of synthesizing new SC circuits. Our results show stochastic
synthesis is more general than past techniques and can synthesize manually
designed SC circuits as well as new ones such as an approximate square root
unit.
"
1311,Towards Cytoskeleton Computers. A proposal,"  We propose a road-map to experimental implementation of cytoskeleton-based
computing devices. An overall concept is described in the following.
Collision-based cytoskeleton computers implement logical gates via interactions
between travelling localisation (voltage solitons on AF/MT chains and AF/MT
polymerisation wave fronts). Cytoskeleton networks are grown via programmable
polymerisation. Data are fed into the AF/MT computing networks via electrical
and optical means. Data signals are travelling localisations (solitons,
conformational defects) at the network terminals. The computation is
implemented via collisions between the localisations at structural gates
(branching sites) of the AF/MT network. The results of the computation are
recorded electrically and/or optically at the output terminals of the protein
networks. As additional options, optical I/O elements are envisaged via direct
excitation of the protein network and by coupling to fluorescent molecules.
"
1312,Parallelized Linear Classification with Volumetric Chemical Perceptrons,"  In this work, we introduce a new type of linear classifier that is
implemented in a chemical form. We propose a novel encoding technique which
simultaneously represents multiple datasets in an array of microliter-scale
chemical mixtures. Parallel computations on these datasets are performed as
robotic liquid handling sequences, whose outputs are analyzed by
high-performance liquid chromatography. As a proof of concept, we chemically
encode several MNIST images of handwritten digits and demonstrate successful
chemical-domain classification of the digits using volumetric perceptrons. We
additionally quantify the performance of our method with a larger dataset of
binary vectors and compare the experimental measurements against predicted
results. Paired with appropriate chemical analysis tools, our approach can work
on increasingly parallel datasets. We anticipate that related approaches will
be scalable to multilayer neural networks and other more complex algorithms.
Much like recent demonstrations of archival data storage in DNA, this work
blurs the line between chemical and electrical information systems, and offers
early insight into the computational efficiency and massive parallelism which
may come with computing in chemical domains.
"
1313,Fault Adaptive Routing in Metasurface Controller Networks,"  HyperSurfaces are a merge of structurally reconfigurable metasurfaces whose
electromagnetic properties can be changed via a software interface, using an
embedded miniaturized network of controllers, thus enabling novel capabilities
in wireless communications. Resource constraints associated with the
development of a hardware testbed of this breakthrough technology necessitate
network controller architectures different from traditional regular
Network-on-Chip architectures. The Manhattan-like topology chosen to realize
the controller network in the testbed under development is irregular, with
restricted local path selection options, operating in an asynchronous fashion.
These characteristics render traditional fault-tolerant routing mechanisms
inadequate. In this paper, we present work in progress towards the development
of fault-tolerant routing mechanisms for the chosen architecture. We present
two XY-based approaches which have been developed aiming to offer reliable data
delivery in the presence of faults. The first approach aims to avoid loops
while the second one attempts to maximize the success delivery probabilities.
Their effectiveness is demonstrated via simulations conducted on a custom
developed simulator.
"
1314,"A Time-domain Analog Weighted-sum Calculation Model for Extremely Low
  Power VLSI Implementation of Multi-layer Neural Networks","  A time-domain analog weighted-sum calculation model is proposed based on an
integrate-and-fire-type spiking neuron model. The proposed calculation model is
applied to multi-layer feedforward networks, in which weighted summations with
positive and negative weights are separately performed in each layer and
summation results are then fed into the next layers without their subtraction
operation. We also propose very large-scale integrated (VLSI) circuits to
implement the proposed model. Unlike the conventional analog voltage or current
mode circuits, the time-domain analog circuits use transient operation in
charging/discharging processes to capacitors. Since the circuits can be
designed without operational amplifiers, they can operate with extremely low
power consumption. However, they have to use very high resistance devices on
the order of G$\rm \Omega$. We designed a proof-of-concept (PoC) CMOS VLSI chip
to verify weighted-sum operation with the same weights and evaluated it by
post-layout circuit simulation using 250-nm fabrication technology. High
resistance operation was realized by using the subthreshold operation region of
MOS transistors. Simulation results showed that energy efficiency for the
weighted-sum calculation was 290~TOPS/W, more than one order of magnitude
higher than that in state-of-the-art digital AI processors, even though the
minimum width of interconnection used in the PoC chip was several times larger
than that in such digital processors. If state-of-the-art VLSI technology is
used to implement the proposed model, an energy efficiency of more than
1,000~TOPS/W will be possible. For practical applications, development of
emerging analog memory devices such as ferroelectric-gate FETs is necessary.
"
1315,"A Roadmap Towards Resilient Internet of Things for Cyber-Physical
  Systems","  The Internet of Things (IoT) is a ubiquitous system connecting many different
devices - the things - which can be accessed from the distance. The
cyber-physical systems (CPS) monitor and control the things from the distance.
As a result, the concepts of dependability and security get deeply intertwined.
The increasing level of dynamicity, heterogeneity, and complexity adds to the
system's vulnerability, and challenges its ability to react to faults. This
paper summarizes state-of-the-art of existing work on anomaly detection,
fault-tolerance and self-healing, and adds a number of other methods applicable
to achieve resilience in an IoT. We particularly focus on non-intrusive methods
ensuring data integrity in the network. Furthermore, this paper presents the
main challenges in building a resilient IoT for CPS which is crucial in the era
of smart CPS with enhanced connectivity (an excellent example of such a system
is connected autonomous vehicles). It further summarizes our solutions,
work-in-progress and future work to this topic to enable ""Trustworthy IoT for
CPS"". Finally, this framework is illustrated on a selected use case: A smart
sensor infrastructure in the transport domain.
"
1316,A Substrate-Independent Framework to Characterise Reservoir Computers,"  The Reservoir Computing (RC) framework states that any non-linear,
input-driven dynamical system (the reservoir) exhibiting properties such as a
fading memory and input separability can be trained to perform computational
tasks. This broad inclusion of systems has led to many new physical substrates
for RC. Properties essential for reservoirs to compute are tuned through
reconfiguration of the substrate, such as change in virtual topology or
physical morphology. As a result, each substrate possesses a unique `quality'
-- obtained through reconfiguration -- to realise different reservoirs for
different tasks. Here we describe an experimental framework to characterise the
quality of potentially any substrate for RC. Our framework reveals that a
definition of quality is not only useful to compare substrates, but can help
map the non-trivial relationship between properties and task performance. In
the wider context, the framework offers a greater understanding as to what
makes a dynamical system compute, helping improve the design of future
substrates for RC.
"
1317,"A highly scalable and energy-efficient artificial neuron using an Ovonic
  Threshold Switch (OTS) featuring the spike-frequency adaptation and chaotic
  activity","  As an essential building block for developing a large-scale brain-inspired
computing system, we present a highly scalable and energy-efficient artificial
neuron device composed of an Ovonic Threshold Switch (OTS) and a few passive
electrical components. It shows not only the basic integrate-and-fire (I&F)
function and the rate coding ability, but also the spike-frequency adaptation
(SFA) property and the chaotic activity. The latter two, being the most common
features found in the mammalian cortex, are particularly essential for the
realization of the energy-efficient signal processing, learning, and adaptation
to environments1-3, but have been hard to achieve up to now. Furthermore, with
our OTS-based neuron device employing the reservoir computing technique
combined with delayed feedback dynamics, spoken-digit recognition task has been
performed with a considerable degree of recognition accuracy. From a comparison
with a Mott memristor-based artificial neuron device, it is shown that the
OTS-based artificial neuron is much more energy-efficient by about 100 times.
These results show that our OTS-based artificial neuron device is promising for
the application in the development of a large-scale brain-inspired computing
system.
"
1318,Quantum Internet: Networking Challenges in Distributed Quantum Computing,"  The Quantum Internet is envisioned as the final stage of the quantum
revolution, opening fundamentally new communications and computing
capabilities, including the distributed quantum computing. But the Quantum
Internet is governed by the laws of quantum mechanics. Phenomena with no
counterpart in classical networks, such as no-cloning, quantum measurement,
entanglement and teleporting, impose very challenging constraints for the
network design. Specifically, classical network functionalities, ranging from
error-control mechanisms to overhead-control strategies, are based on the
assumption that classical information can be safely read and copied. But this
assumption does not hold in the Quantum Internet. As a consequence, the design
of the Quantum Internet requires a major network-paradigm shift to harness the
quantum mechanics specificities. The goal of this work is to shed light on the
challenges and the open problems of the Quantum Internet design. To this aim,
we first introduce some basic knowledge of quantum mechanics, needed to
understand the differences between a classical and a quantum network. Then, we
introduce quantum teleportation as the key strategy for transmitting quantum
information without physically transferring the particle that stores the
quantum information or violating the principles of the quantum mechanics.
Finally, the key research challenges to design quantum communication networks
are described.
"
1319,Some Coxeter Groups in Reversible and Quantum Compuation,"  In this article we show how the structure of Coxeter groups are present in
gate sets of reversible and quantum computing. These groups have efficient word
problems which means that circuits built from these gates have potential to be
shortened efficiently. This is especially useful in the case of quantum
computing when one does not have the timescale to perform a long series of
gates and so one must and a gate scheduling that minimizes circuit depth. As
the main example we consider the oracle for 3SAT.
"
1320,Logical gates embedding in Artificial Spin Ice,"  The realization and study of arrays of interacting magnetic nanoislands, such
as artificial spin ices, have reached mature levels of control that allow
design and demonstration of exotic, collective behaviors not seen in natural
materials. Advances in the direct manipulation of their local, binary moments
also suggest a use as nanopatterned, interacting memory media, for computation
{\it within} a magnetic memory. Recent experimental work has demonstrated the
possibility of building logic gates from clusters of interacting magnetic
domains, and yet the possibility of large scale integration of such gates can
prove problematic even at the theoretical level. Here we introduce
theoretically complete sets of logical gates, in principle realizable in an
experiment, and we study the feasibility of their integration into tree-like
circuits. By evaluating the fidelity control parameter between their collective
behavior and their expected logic functionality we determine conditions for
integration. Also, we test our numerical results against the presence of
disorder in the couplings, showing that the design gate structure is robust to
small coupling perturbations, and thus possibly to small imperfections in the
fabrication of the islands.
"
1321,Scalable NoC-based Neuromorphic Hardware Learning and Inference,"  Bio-inspired neuromorphic hardware is a research direction to approach
brain's computational power and energy efficiency. Spiking neural networks
(SNN) encode information as sparsely distributed spike trains and employ
spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) mechanism for learning. Existing
hardware implementations of SNN are limited in scale or do not have in-hardware
learning capability. In this work, we propose a low-cost scalable
Network-on-Chip (NoC) based SNN hardware architecture with fully distributed
in-hardware STDP learning capability. All hardware neurons work in parallel and
communicate through the NoC. This enables chip-level interconnection,
scalability and reconfigurability necessary for deploying different
applications. The hardware is applied to learn MNIST digits as an evaluation of
its learning capability. We explore the design space to study the trade-offs
between speed, area and energy. How to use this procedure to find optimal
architecture configuration is also discussed.

1322,"The Multi-Scale Impact of the Alzheimer's Disease in the Topology
  Diversity of Astrocytes Molecular Communications Nanonetworks","  The Internet of Bio-Nano-Things is a new paradigm that can bring novel
remotely controlled actuation and sensing techniques inside the human body.
Towards precise bionano sensing techniques in the brain, we investigate the
challenges of modelling spatial distribution of astrocyte networks in
developing a mathematical framework that lay the groundwork for future
early-detection techniques of neurodegenerative disease. In this paper, we
investigate the effect of the $\beta$-amyloid plaques in astrocytes with the
Alzheimer's disease. We developed a computation model of healthy and
Alzheimer's diseases astrocytes networks from the state of the art models and
results that account for the intracellular pathways, IP$_3$ dynamics, gap
junctions, voltage-gated calcium channels and astrocytes volumes. We also
implemented different types of astrocytes network topologies including shortcut
networks, regular degree networks, Erd\""os R\'enyi networks and link radius
networks. A proposed multi-scale stochastic computational model captures the
relationship between the intracellular and intercellular scales. Lastly, we
designed and evaluated a single-hop communication system with frequency
modulation using metrics such as propagation extend, molecular delay and
channel gain. The results show that the more unstable but at the same time
lower level oscillations of Alzheimer's astrocyte networks can create a
multi-scale effect on communication between astrocytes with increased molecular
delay and lower channel gain compared to healthy astrocytes, with an elevated
impact on Erd\""os R\'enyi networks and link radius networks topologies.

1323,"A High Accuracy and High Sensitivity System Architecture for Electrical
  Impedance Tomography System","  A high accuracy and high sensitivity system architecture is proposed for the
read-out circuit of electrical impedance tomography system-on-chip. The
switched ratiometric technique is applied in the proposed architecture. The
proposed system architecture minimizes the device noise by processing signals
from both read-out electrodes and the stimulus. The quantized signals are
post-processed in the digital processing unit for proper signal demodulation
and impedance ratio calculation. Our proposed architecture improves the
sensitivity of the read-out circuit, cancels out the gain fluctuations in the
system, and overcomes the effects of motion artifacts on measurements.

1324,SOT-MRAM 300mm integration for low power and ultrafast embedded memories,"  We demonstrate for the first time full-scale integration of top-pinned
perpendicular MTJ on 300 mm wafer using CMOS-compatible processes for
spin-orbit torque (SOT)-MRAM architectures. We show that 62 nm devices with a
W-based SOT underlayer have very large endurance (> 5x10^10), sub-ns switching
time of 210 ps, and operate with power as low as 300 pJ.
"
1325,"Experimental Investigation of Programmed State Stability in OxRAM
  Resistive Memories","  Oxide-based Random Access Memory (OxRAM), is part of the larger family of
Resistive RAM (RRAM) memories. Generally OxRAM cells consist of a transition
metal oxide (typically HfO2, Ta2O5, TiO2) sandwiched between two metal
electrodes (typically TiN, TaN, W but also Pt, Ir). This thesis describes the
experimental investigation performed on OxRAM memories during a 6-months
internship project at imec research institute (Leuven, Belgium). From previous
studies, HfO-based OxRAM memories showed good endurance properties (with more
than 10e9 write cycles), low operating current (as low as 10 uA), and very fast
switching (programming pulses of 100 ns). However, it has been observed that,
under low programming current condition, data stability becomes challenging.
Therefore, this programming state stability needed further investigation. This
thesis addresses the problem of state stability, first, by presenting the
equipment and algorithms used to study OxRAM state loss over short time
intervals. Secondly, various experiments and tests are performed searching for
a key parameter in order to control memory retention. Finally, this work
demonstrates that resistance evolution over time is affected by both a
determinist drift (logarithmically dependent on time) and a random stochastic
fluctuation component. It also demonstrates that this behavior is intrinsic in
the nature of the device itself and does not depend on processing issues or
variation in the programming conditions. This experimental study proved the
intrinsic nature of the program instability phenomena in OxRAM devices, which
in turns leads to the ineffectiveness of verify algorithm for low current
operation.
"
1326,"Adaptive motor control and learning in a spiking neural network realised
  on a mixed-signal neuromorphic processor","  Neuromorphic computing is a new paradigm for design of both the computing
hardware and algorithms inspired by biological neural networks. The event-based
nature and the inherent parallelism make neuromorphic computing a promising
paradigm for building efficient neural network based architectures for control
of fast and agile robots. In this paper, we present a spiking neural network
architecture that uses sensory feedback to control rotational velocity of a
robotic vehicle. When the velocity reaches the target value, the mapping from
the target velocity of the vehicle to the correct motor command, both
represented in the spiking neural network on the neuromorphic device, is
autonomously stored on the device using on-chip plastic synaptic weights. We
validate the controller using a wheel motor of a miniature mobile vehicle and
inertia measurement unit as the sensory feedback and demonstrate online
learning of a simple 'inverse model' in a two-layer spiking neural network on
the neuromorphic chip. The prototype neuromorphic device that features 256
spiking neurons allows us to realise a simple proof of concept architecture for
the purely neuromorphic motor control and learning. The architecture can be
easily scaled-up if a larger neuromorphic device is available.
"
1327,"Use of Magnetoresistive Random-Access Memory as Approximate Memory for
  Training Neural Networks","  Hardware neural networks that implement synaptic weights with embedded
non-volatile memory, such as spin torque memory (ST-MRAM), are a major lead for
low energy artificial intelligence. In this work, we propose an approximate
storage approach for their memory. We show that this strategy grants effective
control of the bit error rate by modulating the programming pulse amplitude or
duration. Accounting for the devices variability issue, we evaluate energy
savings, and show how they translate when training a hardware neural network.
On an image recognition example, 74% of programming energy can be saved by
losing only 1% on the recognition performance.

1328,"A Distributed Epigenetic Shape Formation and Regeneration Algorithm for
  a Swarm of Robots","  Living cells exhibit both growth and regeneration of body tissues. Epigenetic
Tracking (ET), models this growth and regenerative qualities of living cells
and has been used to generate complex 2D and 3D shapes. In this paper, we
present an ET based algorithm that aids a swarm of identically-programmed
robots to form arbitrary shapes and regenerate them when cut. The algorithm
works in a distributed manner using only local interactions and computations
without any central control and aids the robots to form the shape in a
triangular lattice structure. In case of damage or splitting of the shape, it
helps each set of the remaining robots to regenerate and position themselves to
build scaled down versions of the original shape. The paper presents the shapes
formed and regenerated by the algorithm using the Kilombo simulator.
"
1329,Parallel Entangling Operations on a Universal Ion Trap Quantum Computer,"  The circuit model of a quantum computer consists of sequences of gate
operations between quantum bits (qubits), drawn from a universal family of
discrete operations. The ability to execute parallel entangling quantum gates
offers clear efficiency gains in numerous quantum circuits as well as for
entire algorithms such as Shor's factoring algorithm and quantum simulations.
In cases such as full adders and multiple-control Toffoli gates, parallelism
can provide an exponential improvement in overall execution time. More
importantly, quantum gate parallelism is essential for the practical
fault-tolerant error correction of qubits that suffer from idle errors. The
implementation of parallel quantum gates is complicated by potential crosstalk,
especially between qubits fully connected by a common-mode bus, such as in
Coulomb-coupled trapped atomic ions or cavity-coupled superconducting
transmons. Here, we present the first experimental results for parallel 2-qubit
entangling gates in an array of fully-connected trapped ion qubits. We
demonstrate an application of this capability by performing a 1-bit full
addition operation on a quantum computer using a depth-4 quantum circuit. These
results exploit the power of highly connected qubit systems through classical
control techniques, and provide an advance toward speeding up quantum circuits
and achieving fault tolerance with trapped ion quantum computers.

1330,"Programming Substrate-Independent Kinetic Barriers with Thermodynamic
  Binding Networks","  Engineering molecular systems that exhibit complex behavior requires the
design of kinetic barriers. For example, an effective catalytic pathway must
have a large barrier when the catalyst is absent. While programming such energy
barriers seems to require knowledge of the specific molecular substrate, we
develop a novel substrate-independent approach. We extend the
recently-developed model known as thermodynamic binding networks, demonstrating
programmable kinetic barriers that arise solely from the thermodynamic driving
forces of bond formation and the configurational entropy of forming separate
complexes. Our kinetic model makes relatively weak assumptions, which implies
that energy barriers predicted by our model would exist in a wide variety of
systems and conditions. We demonstrate that our model is robust by showing that
several variations in its definition result in equivalent energy barriers. We
apply this model to design catalytic systems with an arbitrarily large energy
barrier to uncatalyzed reactions. Our results could yield robust amplifiers
using DNA strand displacement, a popular technology for engineering synthetic
reaction pathways, and suggest design strategies for preventing undesired
kinetic behavior in a variety of molecular systems.

1331,Reservoir computing with dipole-coupled nanomagnets,"  The feasibility of reservoir computing based on dipole-coupled nanomagnets is
demonstrated using micro-magnetic simulations. The reservoir consists of an
2x10 array of nanomagnets. The static-magnetization directions of the
nanomagnets are used as reservoir states. To update these states, we change the
magnetization of one nanomagnet according to a single-bit-sequential signal. We
also change the uniaxial anisotropy of the other nanomagnets using a
voltage-induced magnetic-anisotropy change to enhance information flow,
storage, and linear/nonlinear calculations. Binary tasks with AND, OR, and XOR
operations were performed to evaluate the performance of the magnetic-array
reservoir. The reservoir-computing output matrix was found to be trainable to
perform AND, OR, and XOR operations with an input delay of up to three bits.
"
1332,"Supervised learning of an opto-magnetic neural network with ultrashort
  laser pulses","  The explosive growth of data and its related energy consumption is pushing
the need to develop energy-efficient brain-inspired schemes and materials for
data processing and storage. Here, we demonstrate experimentally that Co/Pt
films can be used as artificial synapses by manipulating their magnetization
state using circularly-polarized ultrashort optical pulses at room temperature.
We also show an efficient implementation of supervised perceptron learning on
an opto-magnetic neural network, built from such magnetic synapses.
Importantly, we demonstrate that the optimization of synaptic weights can be
achieved using a global feedback mechanism, such that the learning does not
rely on external storage or additional optimization schemes. These results
suggest there is high potential for realizing artificial neural networks using
optically-controlled magnetization in technologically relevant materials, that
can learn not only fast but also energy-efficient.
"
1333,Communication Through Breath: Aerosol Transmission,"  Exhaled breath can be used in retrieving information and creating innovative
communication systems. It contains several volatile organic compounds (VOCs)
and biological entities that can act as health biomarkers. For instance, the
breath of infected human contains a nonnegligible amount of pathogenic aerosol
that can spread or remain suspended in the atmosphere. Therefore, the exhaled
breath can be exploited as a source's message in a communication setup to
remotely scan the bio-information via an aerosol transmission channel. An
overview of the basic configuration is presented along with a description of
system components with a particular emphasis on channel modeling. Furthermore,
the challenges that arise in theoretical analysis and system development are
highlighted. Finally, several open issues are discussed to concretize the
proposed communication concept.
"
1334,SkyLogic - A proposal for a skyrmion logic device,"  This work proposes a novel logic device (SkyLogic) based on skyrmions, which
are magnetic vortex-like structures that have low depinning current density and
are robust to defects. A charge current sent through a polarizer ferromagnet
(P-FM) nucleates a skyrmion at the input end of an intra-gate FM interconnect
with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA-FM). The output end of the PMA--FM
forms the free layer of an MTJ stack. A spin Hall metal (SHM) is placed beneath
the PMA-FM. The skyrmion is propagated to the output end of the PMA-FM by
passing a charge current through the SHM. The resistance of the MTJ stack is
low (high) when a skyrmion is present (absent) in the free layer, thereby
realizing an inverter. A framework is developed to analyze the performance of
the SkyLogic device. A circuit-level technique is developed that counters the
transverse displacement of skyrmion in the PMA-FM and allows use of high
current densities for fast propagation. The design space exploration of the
PMA-FM material parameters is performed to obtain an optimal design point. At
the optimal point, we obtain an inverter delay of 434 ps with a switching
energy of 7.1 fJ.

1335,"Neural Network-Hardware Co-design for Scalable RRAM-based BNN
  Accelerators","  Recently, RRAM-based Binary Neural Network (BNN) hardware has been gaining
interests as it requires 1-bit sense-amp only and eliminates the need for
high-resolution ADC and DAC. However, RRAM-based BNN hardware still requires
high-resolution ADC for partial sum calculation to implement large-scale neural
network using multiple memory arrays. We propose a neural network-hardware
co-design approach to split input to fit each split network on a RRAM array so
that the reconstructed BNNs calculate 1-bit output neuron in each array. As a
result, ADC can be completely eliminated from the design even for large-scale
neural network. Simulation results show that the proposed network
reconstruction and retraining recovers the inference accuracy of the original
BNN. The accuracy loss of the proposed scheme in the CIFAR-10 testcase was less
than 1.1% compared to the original network. The code for training and running
proposed BNN models is available at:

1336,"Solving SAT and MaxSAT with a Quantum Annealer: Foundations, Encodings,
  and Preliminary Results","  Quantum annealers (QAs) are specialized quantum computers that minimize
objective functions over discrete variables by physically exploiting quantum
effects. Current QA platforms allow for the optimization of quadratic
objectives defined over binary variables (qubits), also known as Ising
problems. In the last decade, QA systems as implemented by D-Wave have scaled
with Moore-like growth. Current architectures provide 2048 sparsely-connected
qubits, and continued exponential growth is anticipated, together with
increased connectivity. We explore the feasibility of such architectures for
solving SAT and MaxSAT problems as QA systems scale. We develop techniques for
effectively encoding SAT -and, with some limitations, MaxSAT- into Ising
problems compatible with sparse QA architectures. We provide the theoretical
foundations for this mapping, and present encoding techniques that combine
offline Satisfiability and Optimization Modulo Theories with on-the-fly
placement and routing. Preliminary empirical tests on a current generation
2048-qubit D-Wave system support the feasibility of the approach for certain
SAT and MaxSAT problems.
"
1337,Heuristic Recurrent Algorithms for Photonic Ising Machines,"  The inability of conventional electronic architectures to efficiently solve
large combinatorial problems motivates the development of novel computational
hardware. There has been much effort recently toward developing novel,
application-specific hardware, across many different fields of engineering,
such as integrated circuits, memristors, and photonics. However, unleashing the
true potential of such novel architectures requires the development of featured
algorithms which optimally exploit their fundamental properties. We here
present the Photonic Recurrent Ising Sampler (PRIS), a heuristic method
tailored for parallel architectures that allows for fast and efficient sampling
from distributions of combinatorially hard Ising problems. Since the PRIS
relies essentially on vector-to-fixed matrix multiplications, we suggest the
implementation of the PRIS in photonic parallel networks, which realize these
operations at an unprecedented speed. The PRIS provides sample solutions to the
ground state of arbitrary Ising models, by converging in probability to their
associated Gibbs distribution. By running the PRIS at various noise levels, we
probe the critical behavior of universality classes and their critical
exponents. In addition to the attractive features of photonic networks, the
PRIS relies on intrinsic dynamic noise and eigenvalue dropout to find ground
states more efficiently. Our work suggests speedups in heuristic methods via
photonic implementations of the PRIS. We also hint at a broader class of
(meta)heuristic algorithms derived from the PRIS, such as combined simulated
annealing on the noise and eigenvalue dropout levels. Our algorithm can also be
implemented in a competitive manner on fast parallel electronic hardware, such
as FPGAs and ASICs.

1338,Demonstrating Advantages of Neuromorphic Computation: A Pilot Study,"  Neuromorphic devices represent an attempt to mimic aspects of the brain's
architecture and dynamics with the aim of replicating its hallmark functional
capabilities in terms of computational power, robust learning and energy
efficiency. We employ a single-chip prototype of the BrainScaleS 2 neuromorphic
system to implement a proof-of-concept demonstration of reward-modulated
spike-timing-dependent plasticity in a spiking network that learns to play the
Pong video game by smooth pursuit. This system combines an electronic
mixed-signal substrate for emulating neuron and synapse dynamics with an
embedded digital processor for on-chip learning, which in this work also serves
to simulate the virtual environment and learning agent. The analog emulation of
neuronal membrane dynamics enables a 1000-fold acceleration with respect to
biological real-time, with the entire chip operating on a power budget of 57mW.
Compared to an equivalent simulation using state-of-the-art software, the
on-chip emulation is at least one order of magnitude faster and three orders of
magnitude more energy-efficient. We demonstrate how on-chip learning can
mitigate the effects of fixed-pattern noise, which is unavoidable in analog
substrates, while making use of temporal variability for action exploration.
Learning compensates imperfections of the physical substrate, as manifested in
neuronal parameter variability, by adapting synaptic weights to match
respective excitability of individual neurons.
"
1339,Near Zero-Energy Computation Using Quantum-dot Cellular Automata,"  Near zero-energy computing describes the concept of executing logic
operations below the (kBT ln 2) energy limit. Landauer discussed that it is
impossible to break this limit as long as the computations are performed in the
conventional, non-reversible way. But even if reversible computations were
performed, the basic energy needed for operating circuits realized in
conventional technologies is still far above the (kBT ln 2) energy limit, i.e.
the circuits do not operate physically reversible. In contrast, novel
nanotechnologies like Quantum-dot Cellular Automata (QCA) allow for
computations with very low energy dissipation and, hence, are promising
candidates for breaking this limit. Accordingly, the design of reversible QCA
circuits is an active field of research. But whether QCA in general (and the
proposed circuits in particular) are indeed able to operate in a logically and
physically reversible fashion is unknown thus far, because neither physical
realizations nor appropriate simulation approaches were available yet. In this
work, we address this gap by utilizing an established theoretical model that
has been implemented in a physics simulator enabling a precise consideration of
how energy is dissipated in QCA designs. Our results provide strong evidence
that QCA is indeed a suitable technology for near zero-energy computing.
Further, the first design of a logically and physically reversible adder
circuit is presented which serves as proof-of-concept for future circuits with
the ability of near zero-energy computing.

1340,"Bias Scheme Reducing Transient Currents and Speeding up Read Operations
  for 3-D Cross Point PCM","  3-D cross point phase change memory (PCM) is a promising emerging memory.
However, dynamic performances of 3-D cross point PCM are limited and the role
of bias scheme is unknown. Previous studies on bias schemes for planar memories
use static analyses to assess static array performances. Here, a high peak
transient read current is found to result in a long read access time. Three
factors which contribute to the high peak read current are analyzed. The
proposed 2V/3 bias scheme and a single-reference parasitic-matching sensing
circuit are utilized in a 64Mbit 3-D cross point PCM. The sensing time is
reduced by 22.5%. Designing bias schemes through dynamic analyses paves the way
for the development of high-performance 3-D PCM technology to boost the working
efficiency of computing systems.
  The following contents are the listed errors as mentioned in the comments for
reasons of withdrawal: missing labels of Fig.1, lack of the explanation of the
peak current on the sensing speed, lack of the reason of the chosen of 2V/3
scheme, lack of influence of the parasitic capacitors, unclear explanation of
the factor that contributes to a high peak read current, lack of comparisons,
lack of the explanation of the sneak current, lack of the explanations of the
SRPM sensing circuit, lack of the define valuables like NM_{A1}, unclear
explanation of comparisons of the power consumption, wrong writing of the two
conventional circuits, writing of 3D-IC, wrong writing of number of memory
layers, etc. These errors may confuse a good understanding of our work.
Therefore, we decide to withdraw this manuscript from arXiv. We will
significantly rewrite it and publish the correct and complete paper in the
future.

"
1342,"PennyLane: Automatic differentiation of hybrid quantum-classical
  computations","  PennyLane is a Python 3 software framework for optimization and machine
learning of quantum and hybrid quantum-classical computations. The library
provides a unified architecture for near-term quantum computing devices,
supporting both qubit and continuous-variable paradigms. PennyLane's core
feature is the ability to compute gradients of variational quantum circuits in
a way that is compatible with classical techniques such as backpropagation.
PennyLane thus extends the automatic differentiation algorithms common in
optimization and machine learning to include quantum and hybrid computations. A
plugin system makes the framework compatible with any gate-based quantum
simulator or hardware. We provide plugins for Strawberry Fields, Rigetti
Forest, Qiskit, Cirq, and ProjectQ, allowing PennyLane optimizations to be run
on publicly accessible quantum devices provided by Rigetti and IBM Q. On the
classical front, PennyLane interfaces with accelerated machine learning
libraries such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and autograd. PennyLane can be used for
the optimization of variational quantum eigensolvers, quantum approximate
optimization, quantum machine learning models, and many other applications.

1343,Amplitude-Aware Lossy Compression for Quantum Circuit Simulation,"  Classical simulation of quantum circuits is crucial for evaluating and
validating the design of new quantum algorithms. However, the number of quantum
state amplitudes increases exponentially with the number of qubits, leading to
the exponential growth of the memory requirement for the simulations. In this
paper, we present a new data reduction technique to reduce the memory
requirement of quantum circuit simulations. We apply our amplitude-aware lossy
compression technique to the quantum state amplitude vector to trade the
computation time and fidelity for memory space. The experimental results show
that our simulator only needs 1/16 of the original memory requirement to
simulate Quantum Fourier Transform circuits with 99.95% fidelity. The reduction
amount of memory requirement suggests that we could increase 4 qubits in the
quantum circuit simulation comparing to the simulation without our technique.
Additionally, for some specific circuits, like Grover's search, we could
increase the simulation size by 18 qubits.
"
1344,"Memory-Efficient Quantum Circuit Simulation by Using Lossy Data
  Compression","  In order to evaluate, validate, and refine the design of new quantum
algorithms or quantum computers, researchers and developers need methods to
assess their correctness and fidelity. This requires the capabilities of
quantum circuit simulations. However, the number of quantum state amplitudes
increases exponentially with the number of qubits, leading to the exponential
growth of the memory requirement for the simulations. In this work, we present
our memory-efficient quantum circuit simulation by using lossy data
compression. Our empirical data shows that we reduce the memory requirement to
16.5% and 2.24E-06 of the original requirement for QFT and Grover's search,
respectively. This finding further suggests that we can simulate deep quantum
circuits up to 63 qubits with 0.8 petabytes memory.
"
1345,"SLIM: Simultaneous Logic-in-Memory Computing Exploiting Bilayer Analog
  OxRAM Devices","  Von Neumann architecture based computers isolate/physically separate
computation and storage units i.e. data is shuttled between computation unit
(processor) and memory unit to realize logic/ arithmetic and storage functions.
This to-and-fro movement of data leads to a fundamental limitation of modern
computers, known as the memory wall. Logic in-Memory (LIM) approaches aim to
address this bottleneck by computing inside the memory units and thereby
eliminating the energy-intensive and time-consuming data movement. However,
most LIM approaches reported in literature are not truly ""simultaneous"" as
during LIM operation the bitcell can be used only as a Memory cell or only as a
Logic cell. The bitcell is not capable of storing both the Memory/Logic outputs
simultaneously. Here, we propose a novel 'Simultaneous Logic in-Memory' (SLIM)
methodology that allows to implement both Memory and Logic operations
simultaneously on the same bitcell in a non-destructive manner without losing
the previously stored Memory state. Through extensive experiments we
demonstrate the SLIM methodology using non-filamentary bilayer analog OxRAM
devices with NMOS transistors (2T-1R bitcell). Detailed programming scheme,
array level implementation and controller architecture are also proposed.
Furthermore, to study the impact of introducing SLIM array in the memory
hierarchy, a simple image processing application (edge detection) is also
investigated. It has been estimated that by performing all computations inside
the SLIM array, the total Energy Delay Product (EDP) reduces by ~ 40x in
comparison to a modern-day computer. EDP saving owing to reduction in data
transfer between CPU Memory is observed to be ~ 780x.
"
1346,"Faster manipulation of large quantum circuits using wire label reference
  diagrams","  Large scale quantum computing is highly anticipated, and quantum circuit
design automation needs to keep up with the transition from small scale to
large scale problems. Methods to support fast quantum circuit manipulations
(e.g.~gate replacement, wire reordering, etc.) or specific circuit analysis
operations have not been considered important and have been often implemented
in a naive manner thus far. For example, quantum circuits are usually
represented in term of one-dimensional gate lists or as directed acyclic
graphs. Although implementations for quantum circuit manipulations are often
only of polynomial complexity, the sheer number of possibilities to consider
with increasing scales of quantum computations make these representations
highly inefficient -- constituting a serious bottleneck. At the same time,
quantum circuits have structural characteristics, which allow for more specific
and faster approaches. This work utilises these characteristics by introducing
a dedicated representation for large quantum circuits, namely wire label
reference diagrams. We apply the representation to a set of very common circuit
transformations, and develop corresponding solutions which achieve orders of
magnitude performance improvements for circuits which include up to 80 000
qubits and 200 000 gates. The implementation of the proposed method is
available online.
"
1347,"Opening the Doors to Dynamic Camouflaging: Harnessing the Power of
  Polymorphic Devices","  The era of widespread globalization has led to the emergence of
hardware-centric security threats throughout the IC supply chain. Prior
defenses like logic locking, layout camouflaging, and split manufacturing have
been researched extensively to protect against intellectual property (IP)
piracy at different stages. In this work, we present dynamic camouflaging as a
new technique to thwart IP reverse engineering at all stages in the supply
chain, viz., the foundry, the test facility, and the end-user. Toward this end,
we exploit the multi-functionality, post-fabrication reconfigurability, and
run-time polymorphism of spin-based devices, specifically the magneto-electric
spin-orbit (MESO) device. Leveraging these unique properties, dynamic
camouflaging is shown to be resilient against state-of-the-art analytical
SAT-based attacks and test-data mining attacks. Such dynamic reconfigurability
is not afforded in CMOS owing to fundamental differences in operation. For such
MESO-based camouflaging, we also anticipate massive savings in power,
performance, and area over other spin-based camouflaging schemes, due to the
energy-efficient electric-field driven reversal of the MESO device. Based on
thorough experimentation, we outline the promises of dynamic camouflaging in
securing the supply chain end-to-end along with a case study, demonstrating the
efficacy of dynamic camouflaging in securing error-tolerant image processing
IP.
"
1348,"Importance of the window function choice for the predictive modelling of
  memristors","  Window functions are widely employed in memristor models to restrict the
changes of the internal state variables to specified intervals. Here we show
that the actual choice of window function is of significant importance for the
predictive modelling of memristors. Using a recently formulated theory of
memristor attractors, we demonstrate that whether stable fixed points exist
depends on the type of window function used in the model. Our main findings are
formulated in terms of two memristor attractor theorems, which apply to broad
classes of memristor models. As an example of our findings, we predict the
existence of stable fixed points in Biolek window function memristors and their
absence in memristors described by the Joglekar window function, when such
memristors are driven by periodic alternating polarity pulses. It is
anticipated that the results of this study will contribute toward the
development of more sophisticated models of memristive devices and systems.

1349,"Best of Both Worlds: Integration of Split Manufacturing and Camouflaging
  into a Security-Driven CAD Flow for 3D ICs","  With the globalization of manufacturing and supply chains, ensuring the
security and trustworthiness of ICs has become an urgent challenge. Split
manufacturing (SM) and layout camouflaging (LC) are promising techniques to
protect the intellectual property (IP) of ICs from malicious entities during
and after manufacturing (i.e., from untrusted foundries and reverse-engineering
by end-users). In this paper, we strive for ""the best of both worlds,"" that is
of SM and LC. To do so, we extend both techniques towards 3D integration, an
up-and-coming design and manufacturing paradigm based on stacking and
interconnecting of multiple chips/dies/tiers. Initially, we review prior art
and their limitations. We also put forward a novel, practical threat model of
IP piracy which is in line with the business models of present-day design
houses. Next, we discuss how 3D integration is a naturally strong match to
combine SM and LC. We propose a security-driven CAD and manufacturing flow for
face-to-face (F2F) 3D ICs, along with obfuscation of interconnects. Based on
this CAD flow, we conduct comprehensive experiments on DRC-clean layouts.
Strengthened by an extensive security analysis (also based on a novel attack to
recover obfuscated F2F interconnects), we argue that entering the next, third
dimension is eminent for effective and efficient IP protection.

1350,"Unsupervised Online Learning With Multiple Postsynaptic Neurons Based on
  Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity Using a TFT-Type NOR Flash Memory Array","  We present a two-layer fully connected neuromorphic system based on a
thin-film transistor (TFT)-type NOR flash memory array with multiple
postsynaptic (POST) neurons. Unsupervised online learning by
spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) on the binary MNIST handwritten
datasets is implemented, and its recognition result is determined by measuring
firing rate of POST neurons. Using a proposed learning scheme, we investigate
the impact of the number of POST neurons in terms of recognition rate. In this
neuromorphic system, lateral inhibition function and homeostatic property are
exploited for competitive learning of multiple POST neurons. The simulation
results demonstrate unsupervised online learning of the full black-and-white
MNIST handwritten digits by STDP, which indicates the performance of pattern
recognition and classification without preprocessing of input patterns.
"
1351,On buildings that compute. A proposal,"  We present ideas aimed at bringing revolutionary changes on architectures and
buildings of tomorrow by radically advancing the technology for the building
material concrete and hence building components. We propose that by using
nanotechnology we could embed computation and sensing directly into the
material used for construction. Intelligent concrete blocks and panels advanced
with stimuli-responsive smart paints are the core of the proposed architecture.
In particular, the photo-responsive paint would sense the buildings internal
and external environment while the nano-material-concrete composite material
would be capable of sensing the building environment and implement
massive-parallel information processing resulting in distributed decision
making. A calibration of the proposed materials with in-materio suitable
computational methods and corresponding building information modelling,
computer-aided design and digital manufacturing tools could be achieved via
models and prototypes of information processing at nano-level. The emergent
technology sees a building as high-level massive-parallel computer ---
assembled of computing concrete blocks. Based on the generic principles of
neuromorphic computation and reservoir computing we envisage a single building
or an urban quarter to turn into a large-scale sensing substrate. It could
behave as a universal computer, collecting and processing environmental
information in situ enabling appropriate data fusion.

1353,"A Faster DiSH: Hardware Implementation of a Discrete Cell Signaling
  Network Simulator","  Development of fast methods to conduct in silico experiments using
computational models of cellular signaling is a promising approach toward
advances in personalized medicine. However, software-based cellular network
simulation has run-times plagued by wasted CPU cycles and unnecessary
processes. Hardware-based simulation affords substantial speedup, but prior
attempts at hardware-based biological simulation have been limited in scope and
have suffered from inaccuracies due to poor random number generation. In this
work, we propose several hardware-based simulation schemes utilizing novel
random update index generation techniques for step-based and round-based
stochastic simulations of cellular networks. Our results show improved runtimes
while maintaining simulation accuracy compared to software implementations.

analysis via simulation is provided.
"
1355,"On the Influence of Initial Qubit Placement During NISQ Circuit
  Compilation","  Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) machines are not fault-tolerant,
operate few qubits (currently, less than hundred), but are capable of executing
interesting computations. Above the quantum supremacy threshold (approx. 60
qubits), NISQ machines are expected to be more powerful than existing classical
computers. One of the most stringent problems is that computations (expressed
as quantum circuits) have to be adapted (compiled) to the NISQ hardware,
because the hardware does not support arbitrary interactions between the
qubits. This procedure introduces additional gates (e.g. SWAP gates) into the
circuits while leaving the implemented computations unchanged. Each additional
gate increases the failure rate of the adapted (compiled) circuits, because the
hardware and the circuits are not fault-tolerant. It is reasonable to expect
that the placement influences the number of additionally introduced gates.
Therefore, a combinatorial problem arises: how are circuit qubits allocated
(placed) initially to the hardware qubits? The novelty of this work relies on
the methodology used to investigate the influence of the initial placement. To
this end, we introduce a novel heuristic and cost model to estimate the number
of gates necessary to adapt a circuit to a given NISQ architecture. We
implement the heuristic (source code available on github) and benchmark it
using a standard compiler (e.g. from IBM Qiskit) treated as a black box.
Preliminary results indicate that cost reductions of up to 10\% can be achieved
for practical circuit instances on realistic NISQ architectures only by placing
qubits differently than default (trivial placement).
"
1356,Hyperdimensional Computing Nanosystem,"  One viable solution for continuous reduction in energy-per-operation is to
rethink functionality to cope with uncertainty by adopting computational
approaches that are inherently robust to uncertainty. It requires a novel look
at data representations, associated operations, and circuits, and at materials
and substrates that enable them. 3D integrated nanotechnologies combined with
novel brain-inspired computational paradigms that support fast learning and
fault tolerance could lead the way. Recognizing the very size of the brain's
circuits, hyperdimensional (HD) computing can model neural activity patterns
with points in a HD space, that is, with hypervectors as large randomly
generated patterns. At its very core, HD computing is about manipulating and
comparing these patterns inside memory. Emerging nanotechnologies such as
carbon nanotube field effect transistors (CNFETs) and resistive RAM (RRAM), and
their monolithic 3D integration offer opportunities for hardware
implementations of HD computing through tight integration of logic and memory,
energy-efficient computation, and unique device characteristics. We
experimentally demonstrate and characterize an end-to-end HD computing
nanosystem built using monolithic 3D integration of CNFETs and RRAM. With our
nanosystem, we experimentally demonstrate classification of 21 languages with
measured accuracy of up to 98% on >20,000 sentences (6.4 million characters),
training using one text sample (~100,000 characters) per language, and
resilient operation (98% accuracy) despite 78% hardware errors in HD
representation (outputs stuck at 0 or 1). By exploiting the unique properties
of the underlying nanotechnologies, we show that HD computing, when implemented
with monolithic 3D integration, can be up to 420X more energy-efficient while
using 25X less area compared to traditional silicon CMOS implementations.

1357,Implementing Entangled States on a Quantum Computer,"  The study of tensor network theory is an important field and promises a wide
range of experimental and quantum information theoretical applications. Matrix
product state is the most well-known example of tensor network states, which
provides an effective and efficient representation of one-dimensional quantum
systems. Indeed, it lies at the heart of density matrix renormalization group
(DMRG), a most common method for simulation of one-dimensional strongly
correlated quantum systems. It has got attention from several areas varying
from solid-state systems to quantum computing and quantum simulators. We have
considered maximally entangled matrix product states (GHZ and W). Here, we
designed the quantum circuits for implementing the matrix product states. In
this paper, we simulated the matrix product states in customized IBM (2-qubit,
3-qubit and 4-qubit) quantum systems and determined the probability
distribution among the quantum states.

1358,"On-chip learning for domain wall synapse based Fully Connected Neural
  Network","  Spintronic devices are considered as promising candidates in implementing
neuromorphic systems or hardware neural networks, which are expected to perform
better than other existing computing systems for certain data classification
and regression tasks. In this paper, we have designed a feedforward Fully
Connected Neural Network (FCNN) with no hidden layer using spin orbit torque
driven domain wall devices as synapses and transistor based analog circuits as
neurons. A feedback circuit is also designed using transistors, which at every
iteration computes the change in weights of the synapses needed to train the
network using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) method. Subsequently it sends
write current pulses to the domain wall based synaptic devices which move the
domain walls and updates the weights of the synapses. Through a combination of
micromagnetic simulations, analog circuit simulations and numerically solving
FCNN training equations, we demonstrate ""on-chip"" training of the designed FCNN
on the MNIST database of handwritten digits in this paper. We report the
training and test accuracies, energy consumed in the synaptic devices for the
training and possible issues with hardware implementation of FCNN that can
limit its test accuracy.

a spatial discrete cosine transform. We describe the structure of the circuit,
which uses an analog cell that is interlinked using a programmable digital

of a Matlab simulation. Then we show the circuit simulation in Spice. This is
followed by a demonstration of the practical device. This system has

separated from the readily available digital field programmable gate array
(FPGA) components. Further development includes the use of rapid
manufacture-able organic electronics used for the analog components. The
planned uses for this platform include crowd development of software that uses
the underlying pulse based processing. The development package will include
simulators in the form of Matlab and Spice type software platforms.

1361,Computing with Chemical Reaction Networks: A Tutorial,"  Chemical reaction networks (CRNs) model the behavior of chemical reactions in
well-mixed solutions and they can be designed to perform computations. In this
tutorial we give an overview of various computational models for CRNs.
Moreover, we discuss a method to implement arbitrary (abstract) CRNs in a test

1362,"Composable Probabilistic Inference Networks Using MRAM-based Stochastic
  Neurons","  Magnetoresistive random access memory (MRAM) technologies with thermally
unstable nanomagnets are leveraged to develop an intrinsic stochastic neuron as
a building block for restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) to form deep belief
networks (DBNs). The embedded MRAM-based neuron is modeled using precise
physics equations. The simulation results exhibit the desired sigmoidal
relation between the input voltages and probability of the output state. A
probabilistic inference network simulator (PIN-Sim) is developed to realize a
circuit-level model of an RBM utilizing resistive crossbar arrays along with
differential amplifiers to implement the positive and negative weight values.
The PIN-Sim is composed of five main blocks to train a DBN, evaluate its
accuracy, and measure its power consumption. The MNIST dataset is leveraged to
investigate the energy and accuracy tradeoffs of seven distinct network
topologies in SPICE using the 14nm HP-FinFET technology library with the
nominal voltage of 0.8V, in which an MRAM-based neuron is used as the
activation function. The software and hardware level simulations indicate that
a $784\times200\times10$ topology can achieve less than 5% error rates with
$\sim400 pJ$ energy consumption. The error rates can be reduced to 2.5% by
using a $784\times500\times500\times500\times10$ DBN at the cost of
$\sim10\times$ higher energy consumption and significant area overhead.
Finally, the effects of specific hardware-level parameters on power dissipation
and accuracy tradeoffs are identified via the developed PIN-Sim framework.

  Computer","  In this article we cover the canonical problem formulation necessary to
program the D-Wave quantum processing unit (QPU) and discuss how such a problem
is compiled onto the QPU. We also cover recent joint work solving a problem
from topological data analysis on the D-Wave quantum computer. The goal of the

"
1364,A Behavioral Compact Model of 3D NAND Flash Memory,"  We present a behavioral compact model of 3D NAND flash memory for integrated
circuits and system-level applications. This model is easy to implement,
computationally efficient, fast, accurate and effectively accounts for the
different parasitic capacitance coupling effects applicable to the 3D geometry
of the vertical channel Macaroni body charge-trap flash memory. The model
parameter extraction methodology is simple and can be extended to reproduce the
electrical behavior of different 3D NAND flash memory architectures (with
different page size, dimension, or number of stacked layers). We believe that
the developed compact model would equip the circuit designers and system
architects with an effective tool for design-exploration of 3D NAND flash
memory devices for diverse unconventional analog applications.

1365,"Challenges in materials and devices for Resistive-Switching-based
  Neuromorphic Computing","  This tutorial describes challenges and possible avenues for the
implementation of the components of a solid-state system, which emulates a
biological brain. The tutorial is devoted mostly to a charge-based (i.e.
electric controlled) implementation using transition metal oxides materials,
which exhibit unique properties that emulate key functionalities needed for
this application. In the Introduction, we compare the main differences between
a conventional computational machine, based on the Turing-von Neumann paradigm,
to a Neuromorphic machine, which tries to emulate important functionalities of
a biological brain. We also describe the main electrical properties of
biological systems, which would be useful to implement in a charge-based
system. In Chapter II, we describe the main components of a possible
solid-state implementation. In Chapter III, we describe a variety of Resistive
Switching phenomena, which may serve as the functional basis for the
implementation of key devices for Neuromorphic computing. In Chapter IV we
describe why transition metal oxides, are promising materials for future
Neuromorphic machines. Theoretical models describing different resistive
switching mechanisms are discussed in Chapter V while existing implementations
are described in Chapter VI. Chapter VII presents applications to practical
problems. We list in Chapter VIII important basic research challenges and open
issues. We discuss issues related to specific implementations, novel materials,
devices and phenomena. The development of reliable, fault tolerant, energy
efficient devices, their scaling and integration into a Neuromorphic computer
may bring us closer to the development of a machine that rivals the brain.

1366,"Making BREAD: Biomimetic strategies for Artificial Intelligence Now and
  in the Future","  The Artificial Intelligence (AI) revolution foretold of during the 1960s is
well underway in the second decade of the 21st century. Its period of
phenomenal growth likely lies ahead. Still, we believe, there are crucial
lessons that biology can offer that will enable a prosperous future for AI. For
machines in general, and for AI's especially, operating over extended periods
or in extreme environments will require energy usage orders of magnitudes more
efficient than exists today. In many operational environments, energy sources
will be constrained. Any plans for AI devices operating in a challenging
environment must begin with the question of how they are powered, where fuel is
located, how energy is stored and made available to the machine, and how long
the machine can operate on specific energy units. Hence, the materials and
technologies that provide the needed energy represent a critical challenge
towards future use-scenarios of AI and should be integrated into their design.
Here we make four recommendations for stakeholders and especially decision
makers to facilitate a successful trajectory for this technology. First, that
scientific societies and governments coordinate Biomimetic Research for
Energy-efficient, AI Designs (BREAD); a multinational initiative and a funding
strategy for investments in the future integrated design of energetics into AI.
Second, that biomimetic energetic solutions be central to design consideration
for future AI. Third, that a pre-competitive space be organized between
stakeholder partners and fourth, that a trainee pipeline be established to
ensure the human capital required for success in this area.
"
1367,Memristors for the Curious Outsiders,"  We present both an overview and a perspective of recent experimental advances
and proposed new approaches to performing computation using memristors. A
memristor is a 2-terminal passive component with a dynamic resistance depending
on an internal parameter. We provide an brief historical introduction, as well
as an overview over the physical mechanism that lead to memristive behavior.
This review is meant to guide nonpractitioners in the field of memristive
circuits and their connection to machine learning and neural computation.
"
1368,PIMBALL: Binary Neural Networks in Spintronic Memory,"  Neural networks span a wide range of applications of industrial and
commercial significance. Binary neural networks (BNN) are particularly
effective in trading accuracy for performance, energy efficiency or
hardware/software complexity. Here, we introduce a spintronic, re-configurable
in-memory BNN accelerator, PIMBALL: Processing In Memory BNN AcceL(L)erator,
which allows for massively parallel and energy efficient computation. PIMBALL
is capable of being used as a standard spintronic memory (STT-MRAM) array and a
computational substrate simultaneously. We evaluate PIMBALL using multiple
image classifiers and a genomics kernel. Our simulation results show that
PIMBALL is more energy efficient than alternative CPU, GPU, and FPGA based
implementations while delivering higher throughput.

1369,Real-time Closed Loop Neural Decoding on a Neuromorphic Chip,"  This paper presents for the first time a real-time closed loop neuromorphic
decoder chip-driven intra-cortical brain machine interface (iBMI) in a
non-human primate (NHP) based experimental setup. Decoded results show trial
success rates and mean times to target comparable to those obtained by
hand-controlled joystick. Neural control trial success rates of approximately
96% of those obtained by hand-controlled joystick have been demonstrated. Also,
neural control has shown mean target reach speeds of approximately 85% of those
obtained by hand-controlled joystick . These results pave the way for fast and
accurate, fully implantable neuromorphic neural decoders in iBMIs.
"
1370,Nanotechnology: The New Features,"  Nanotechnologies are attracting increasing investments from both governments
and industries around the world, which offers great opportunities to explore
the new emerging nanodevices, such as the Carbon Nanotube and Nanosensors. This
technique exploits the specific properties which arise from structure at a
scale characterized by the interplay of classical physics and quantum
mechanics. It is difficult to predict these properties a priori according to
traditional technologies. Nanotechnologies will be one of the next promising
trends after MOS technologies. However, there has been much hype around
nanotechnology, both by those who want to promote it and those who have fears
about its potentials. This paper gives a deep survey regarding different
aspects of the new nanotechnologies, such as materials, physics, and
semiconductors respectively, followed by an introduction of several
state-of-the-art nanodevices and then new nanotechnology features. Since little
research has been carried out on the toxicity of manufactured nanoparticles and
nanotubes, this paper also discusses several problems in the nanotechnology
area and gives constructive suggestions and predictions.
"
1371,Towards Experimental P-systems using multivesicular liposomes,"  P-systems are abstract computational models inspired by the phospholipid
bilayer membranes generated by biological cells. Illustrated here is a
mechanism by which recursive liposome structures (multivesicular liposomes) may
be experimentally produced through electroformation of
dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC) films for use in `real' P-systems. We
first present the electroformation protocol and microscopic characterisation of
incident liposomes towards estimating the size of computing elements, level of
internal compartment recursion, fault tolerance and stability. Following, we
demonstrate multiple routes towards embedding symbols, namely modification of
swelling solutions, passive diffusion and microinjection. Finally, we discuss
how computing devices based on P-systems can be produced and their current
limitations.

1372,"Channel Modeling for Diffusive Molecular Communication - A Tutorial
  Review","  Molecular communication (MC) is a new communication engineering paradigm
where molecules are employed as information carriers. MC systems are expected
to enable new revolutionary applications such as sensing of target substances
in biotechnology, smart drug delivery in medicine, and monitoring of oil
pipelines or chemical reactors in industrial settings. As for any other kind of
communication, simple yet sufficiently accurate channel models are needed for
the design, analysis, and efficient operation of MC systems. In this paper, we
provide a tutorial review on mathematical channel modeling for diffusive MC
systems. The considered end-to-end MC channel models incorporate the effects of
the release mechanism, the MC environment, and the reception mechanism on the
observed information molecules. Thereby, the various existing models for the
different components of an MC system are presented under a common framework and
the underlying biological, chemical, and physical phenomena are discussed.
Deterministic models characterizing the expected number of molecules observed
at the receiver and statistical models characterizing the actual number of
observed molecules are developed. In addition, we provide channel models for
time-varying MC systems with moving transmitters and receivers, which are
relevant for advanced applications such as smart drug delivery with mobile
nanomachines. For complex scenarios, where simple MC channel models cannot be
obtained from first principles, we investigate simulation-driven and
experimentally-driven channel models. Finally, we provide a detailed discussion
of potential challenges, open research problems, and future directions in
channel modeling for diffusive MC systems.

1373,"My, and others', spiking memristors are true memristors: a response to
  R.S. Williams' question at the New Memory Paradigms: Memristive Phenomena and
  Neuromorphic Applications Faraday Discussion","  At the Faraday Discussion, in the paper titled `Neuromorphic computation with
spiking memristors: habituation, experimental instantiation of logic gates and
a novel sequence-sensitive perceptron model' it was demonstrated that a large
amount of computation could be done in a sequential way using memristor current
spikes (d.c. response). As these spikes are found in many memristors (possibly
all), this novel approach could be highly useful for fast and reproducible
memristor circuits. However, questions were raised as to whether these spikes
were actually due to memristance or merely capacitance in the circuit. In this
longer version of the Faraday Discussion response, as much information as is
available from both published and unpublished data from my lab is marshalled
together. We find that the devices are likely imperfect memristors with some
capacitance, and that the spikes are related to the frequency effect seen in
memristor hysteresis curves, thus are an integral part of memristance.
"
1374,"Superconducting Neuromorphic Computing Using Quantum Phase-Slip
  Junctions","  Superconducting circuits based on quantum phase-slip junctions (QPSJs) can
conduct quantized charge pulses, which naturally resemble action potentials
generated by biological neurons. A corresponding synaptic circuit, which works
as a weighted connection between two neurons, can also be realized by circuits
comprised of QPSJs and magnetic Josephson junctions (MJJs) as a means of charge
modulation for quantized charge propagation. In this paper, we present basic
neuromorphic components such as neuron and synaptic circuits based on
superconducting QPSJs and MJJs. Using a SPICE model developed for QPSJs, neuron
and synaptic circuits have been simulated in WRSPICE to demonstrate possible
operation. We provide estimates for QPSJ energy dissipation and operation speed
based on calculations using simple models. The challenges for implementation of
this technology are also briefly discussed.
"
1375,"Large-Scale Optical Neural Networks based on Photoelectric
  Multiplication","  Recent success in deep neural networks has generated strong interest in
hardware accelerators to improve speed and energy consumption. This paper
presents a new type of photonic accelerator based on coherent detection that is
scalable to large ($N \gtrsim 10^6$) networks and can be operated at high (GHz)
speeds and very low (sub-aJ) energies per multiply-and-accumulate (MAC), using
the massive spatial multiplexing enabled by standard free-space optical
components. In contrast to previous approaches, both weights and inputs are
optically encoded so that the network can be reprogrammed and trained on the
fly. Simulations of the network using models for digit- and
image-classification reveal a ""standard quantum limit"" for optical neural
networks, set by photodetector shot noise. This bound, which can be as low as
50 zJ/MAC, suggests performance below the thermodynamic (Landauer) limit for
digital irreversible computation is theoretically possible in this device. The
proposed accelerator can implement both fully-connected and convolutional
networks. We also present a scheme for back-propagation and training that can
be performed in the same hardware. This architecture will enable a new class of
ultra-low-energy processors for deep learning.
"
1376,Analog Signal Processing Using Stochastic Magnets,"  We present a low barrier magnet based compact hardware unit for analog
stochastic neurons and demonstrate its use as a building-block for neuromorphic
hardware. By coupling circular magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) with a CMOS
based analog buffer, we show that these units can act as leaky-integrate-and
fire (LIF) neurons, a model of biological neural networks particularly suited
for temporal inferencing and pattern recognition. We demonstrate examples of
temporal sequence learning, processing, and prediction tasks in real time, as a
proof of concept demonstration of scalable and adaptive signal-processors.
Efficient non von-Neumann hardware implementation of such processors can open
up a pathway for integration of hardware based cognition in a wide variety of
emerging systems such as IoT, industrial controls, bio- and photo-sensors, and
Unmanned Autonomous Vehicles.
"
1377,Soft Realization: a Bio-inspired Implementation Paradigm,"  Researchers traditionally solve the computational problems through rigorous
and deterministic algorithms called as Hard Computing. These precise algorithms
have widely been realized using digital technology as an inherently reliable
and accurate implementation platform, either in hardware or software forms.
This rigid form of implementation which we refer as Hard Realization relies on
strict algorithmic accuracy constraints dictated to digital design engineers.
Hard realization admits paying as much as necessary implementation costs to
preserve computation precision and determinism throughout all the design and
implementation steps. Despite its prior accomplishments, this conventional
paradigm has encountered serious challenges with today's emerging applications
and implementation technologies. Unlike traditional hard computing, the
emerging soft and bio-inspired algorithms do not rely on fully precise and
deterministic computation. Moreover, the incoming nanotechnologies face
increasing reliability issues that prevent them from being efficiently
exploited in hard realization of applications. This article examines Soft
Realization, a novel bio-inspired approach to design and implementation of an
important category of applications noticing the internal brain structure. The
proposed paradigm mitigates major weaknesses of hard realization by (1)
alleviating incompatibilities with today's soft and bio-inspired algorithms
such as artificial neural networks, fuzzy systems, and human sense signal
processing applications, and (2) resolving the destructive inconsistency with
unreliable nanotechnologies. Our experimental results on a set of well-known
soft applications implemented using the proposed soft realization paradigm in
both reliable and unreliable technologies indicate that significant energy,
delay, and area savings can be obtained compared to the conventional
implementation.

1378,On Testing Quantum Programs,"  A quantum computer (QC) can solve many computational problems more
efficiently than a classic one. The field of QCs is growing: companies (such as
DWave, IBM, Google, and Microsoft) are building QC offerings. We position that
software engineers should look into defining a set of software engineering
practices that apply to QC's software. To start this process, we give examples
of challenges associated with testing such software and sketch potential
solutions to some of these challenges.
"
1379,"PBMap: A Path Balancing Technology Mapping Algorithm for Single Flux
  Quantum Logic Circuits","  This paper presents a path balancing technology mapping algorithm, which is a
new algorithm for generating a mapping solution for a given Boolean network
such that the average logic level difference among fanin gates of each gate in
the network is minimized. Path balancing technology mapping is required in
dc-biased Single Flux Quantum (SFQ) circuits for guaranteeing the correct
operation, and it is beneficial in CMOS circuits to reduce the hazard issues.
We present a dynamic programming based algorithm for path balancing technology
mapping which generates optimal solutions for dc-biased SFQ (e.g. Rapid SFQ or
RSFQ) circuits with tree structure and acts as an effective heuristic for
circuits with general Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure. Experimental
results show that our path balancing technology mapper reduces the balancing
overhead by up to 2.7 times and with an average of 21% compared to the
state-of-the-art academic technology mappers.
"
1380,"Single Flux Quantum Based Ultrahigh Speed Spiking Neuromorphic Processor
  Architecture","  Artificial neural networks inspired by brain operations can improve the
possibilities of solving complex problems more efficiently. Today's computing
hardware, on the other hand, is mainly based on von Neumann architecture and
CMOS technology, which is inefficient at implementing neural networks. For the
first time, we propose an ultrahigh speed, spiking neuromorphic processor
architecture built upon single flux quantum (SFQ) based artificial neurons
(JJ-Neuron). Proposed architecture has the potential to provide higher
performance and power efficiency over the state of the art including CMOS,
memristors and nanophotonics devices. JJ-Neuron has the ultrafast spiking
capability, trainability with commodity design software even after fabrication
and compatibility with commercial CMOS and SFQ foundry services. We
experimentally demonstrate the soma part of the JJ-Neuron for various
activation functions together with peripheral SFQ logic gates. Then, the neural
network is trained for the IRIS dataset and we have shown 100% match with the
results of the offline training with 1.2x${10}^{10}$ synaptic operations per
second (SOPS) and 8.57x${10}^{11}$ SOPS/W performance and power efficiency,
respectively. In addition, scalability for ${10}^{18}$ SOPS and ${10}^{17}$
SOPS/W is shown which is at least five orders of magnitude more efficient than
the state of the art CMOS circuits and one order of magnitude more efficient
than estimations of nanophotonics-based architectures.

1381,"Neuromemrisitive Architecture of HTM with On-Device Learning and
  Neurogenesis","  Hierarchical temporal memory (HTM) is a biomimetic sequence memory algorithm
that holds promise for invariant representations of spatial and spatiotemporal
inputs. This paper presents a comprehensive neuromemristive crossbar
architecture for the spatial pooler (SP) and the sparse distributed
representation classifier, which are fundamental to the algorithm. There are
several unique features in the proposed architecture that tightly link with the
HTM algorithm. A memristor that is suitable for emulating the HTM synapses is
identified and a new Z-window function is proposed. The architecture exploits
the concept of synthetic synapses to enable potential synapses in the HTM. The
crossbar for the SP avoids dark spots caused by unutilized crossbar regions and
supports rapid on-chip training within 2 clock cycles. This research also
leverages plasticity mechanisms such as neurogenesis and homeostatic intrinsic
plasticity to strengthen the robustness and performance of the SP. The proposed
design is benchmarked for image recognition tasks using MNIST and Yale faces
datasets, and is evaluated using different metrics including entropy,
sparseness, and noise robustness. Detailed power analysis at different stages
of the SP operations is performed to demonstrate the suitability for mobile
platforms.
"
1382,"Shortcuts to Thermodynamic Computing: The Cost of Fast and Faithful
  Erasure","  Landauer's Principle states that the energy cost of information processing
must exceed the product of the temperature and the change in Shannon entropy of
the information-bearing degrees of freedom. However, this lower bound is
achievable only for quasistatic, near-equilibrium computations -- that is, only
over infinite time. In practice, information processing takes place in finite
time, resulting in dissipation and potentially unreliable logical outcomes. For
overdamped Langevin dynamics, we show that counterdiabatic potentials can be
crafted to guide systems rapidly and accurately along desired computational
paths, providing shortcuts that allows for the precise design of finite-time
computations. Such shortcuts require additional work, beyond Landauer's bound,
that is irretrievably dissipated into the environment. We show that this
dissipated work is proportional to the computation rate as well as the square
of the information-storing system's length scale. As a paradigmatic example, we
design shortcuts to erase a bit of information metastably stored in a
double-well potential. Though dissipated work generally increases with erasure
fidelity, we show that it is possible perform perfect erasure in finite time
with finite work. We also show that the robustness of information storage
affects the energetic cost of erasure---specifically, the dissipated work
scales as the information lifetime of the bistable system. Our analysis exposes
a rich and nuanced relationship between work, speed, size of the
information-bearing degrees of freedom, storage robustness, and the difference
between initial and final informational statistics.
"
1383,A Circuit-Level Amoeba-Inspired SAT Solver,"  AmbSAT (or AmoebaSAT) is a biologically-inspired stochastic local search
(SLS) solver to explore solutions to the Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT).
AmbSAT updates multiple variables in parallel at every iteration step, and thus
AmbSAT can find solutions with a fewer number of iteration steps than some
other conventional SLS solvers for a specific set of SAT instances. However,
the parallelism of AmbSAT is not compatible with general-purpose
microprocessors in that many clock cycles are required to execute each
iteration; thus, AmbSAT requires special hardware that can exploit the
parallelism of AmbSAT to quickly find solutions. In this paper, we propose a
circuit model (hardware-friendly algorithm) that explores solutions to SAT in a
similar way to AmbSAT, which we call circuit-level AmbSAT (CL-AmbSAT). We
conducted numerical simulation to evaluate the search performance of CL-AmbSAT
for a set of randomly generated SAT instances that was designed to estimate the
scalability of our approach. Simulation results showed that CL-AmbSAT finds
solutions with a fewer iteration number than a powerful SLS solver, ProbSAT,
and outperforms even AmbSAT. Since CL-AmbSAT uses simple combinational logic to
update variables, CL-AmbSAT can be easily implemented in various hardware.
"
1384,"A Hardware Friendly Unsupervised Memristive Neural Network with Weight
  Sharing Mechanism","  Memristive neural networks (MNNs), which use memristors as neurons or
synapses, have become a hot research topic recently. However, most memristors
are not compatible with mainstream integrated circuit technology and their
stabilities in large-scale are not very well so far. In this paper, a hardware
friendly MNN circuit is introduced, in which the memristive characteristics are
implemented by digital integrated circuit. Through this method, spike timing
dependent plasticity (STDP) and unsupervised learning are realized. A weight
sharing mechanism is proposed to bridge the gap of network scale and hardware
resource. Experiment results show the hardware resource is significantly saved
with it, maintaining good recognition accuracy and high speed. Moreover, the
tendency of resource increase is slower than the expansion of network scale,
which infers our method's potential on large scale neuromorphic network's
realization.
"
1385,"MaD: Mapping and debugging framework for implementing deep neural
  network onto a neuromorphic chip with crossbar array of synapses","  Neuromorphic systems or dedicated hardware for neuromorphic computing is
getting popular with the advancement in research on different device materials
for synapses, especially in crossbar architecture and also algorithms specific
or compatible to neuromorphic hardware. Hence, an automated mapping of any deep
neural network onto the neuromorphic chip with crossbar array of synapses and
an efficient debugging framework is very essential. Here, mapping is defined as
the deployment of a section of deep neural network layer onto a neuromorphic
core and the generation of connection lists among population of neurons to
specify the connectivity between various neuromorphic cores on the neuromorphic
chip. Debugging is the verification of computations performed on the
neuromorphic chip during inferencing. Together the framework becomes Mapping
and Debugging (MaD) framework. MaD framework is quite general in usage as it is
a Python wrapper which can be integrated with almost every simulator tools for
neuromorphic chips. This paper illustrates the MaD framework in detail,
considering some optimizations while mapping onto a single neuromorphic core. A
classification task on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets are considered for test case
implementation of MaD framework.
"
1386,"Dilution with Digital Microfluidic Biochips: How Unbalanced Splits
  Corrupt Target-Concentration","  Sample preparation is an indispensable component of almost all biochemical
protocols, and it involves, among others, making dilutions and mixtures of
fluids in certain ratios. Recent microfluidic technologies offer suitable
platforms for automating dilutions on-chip, and typically on a digital
microfluidic biochip (DMFB), a sequence of (1:1) mix-split operations is
performed on fluid droplets to achieve the target concentration factor (CF) of
a sample. An (1:1) mixing model ideally comprises mixing of two unit-volume
droplets followed by a (balanced) splitting into two unit-volume
daughter-droplets. However, a major source of error in fluidic operations is
due to unbalanced splitting, where two unequal-volume droplets are produced
following a split. Such volumetric split-errors occurring in different
mix-split steps of the reaction path often cause a significant drift in the
target-CF of the sample, the precision of which cannot be compromised in
life-critical assays. In order to circumvent this problem, several
error-recovery or error-tolerant techniques have been proposed recently for
DMFBs. Unfortunately, the impact of such fluidic errors on a target-CF and the
dynamics of their behavior have not yet been rigorously analyzed. In this work,
we investigate the effect of multiple volumetric split-errors on various
target-CFs during sample preparation. We also perform a detailed analysis of
the worst-case scenario, i.e., the condition when the error in a target-CF is
maximized. This analysis may lead to the development of new techniques for
error-tolerant sample preparation with DMFBs without using any sensing
operation.
"
1387,3DCAM: A Low Overhead Crosstalk Avoidance Mechanism for TSV-Based 3D ICs,"  Three Dimensional Integrated Circuits (3D IC) offer lower power consumption,
higher performance, higher bandwidth, and scalability over the conventional two
dimensional ICs. Through-Silicon Via (TSV) is one of the fabrication mechanisms
that connects stacked dies to each other. The large size of TSVs and the
proximity between them lead to undesirable coupling capacitance. This
interference causes mutual influences between adjacent TSVs and produces
crosstalk noise. Furthermore, this effect threats the reliability of data
during traversal between layers. This paper proposes a mechanism that
efficiently reduces crosstalk noise between TSVs with lower area overhead as
compared to previous works. This mechanism revolves around the fact that
retaining TSV value in current state can reduce coupling in some cases. To
evaluate the mechanism, gem5 simulator is used for data extraction and several
benchmarks are taken from the SPEC2006 suite. The simulation results show that
the proposed mechanism reduces crosstalk noise with only 30% imposed TSV
overhead while delay decreased up to 25.7% as compared to a recent related
work.

1388,"Trainable Associative Memory Neural Networks in a Quantum-Dot Cellular
  Automata","  Quantum-dot cellular automata (QCAs) offer a diffusive computing paradigm
with picosecond transmission speed, making them an ideal candidate for moving
diffusive computing to real-world applications. By implementing a trainable
associative memory neural network into this substrate, we demonstrate that
high-speed, high-density associative memory is feasible through QCAs. The
presented design occupies $415\text{nm}^2$ per neuron, which translates to
circa $240 \text{ billion neurons/cm}^2$, or $28\text{GB/cm}^2$ of memory
storage, offering a real possibility for large-scale associative memory
circuits. Results are presented from simulation, demonstrating correct working
behaviour of the associative memory in single neurons, two-neuron and
four-neuron arrays.
"
1389,SFQmap: A Technology Mapping Tool for Single Flux Quantum Logic Circuits,"  Single flux quantum (SFQ) logic is a promising candidate to replace the CMOS
logic for high speed and low power applications due to its superiority in
providing high performance and energy efficient circuits. However, developing
effective Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools, which cater to special
characteristics and requirements of SFQ circuits such as depth minimization and
path balancing, are essential to automate the whole process of designing large
SFQ circuits. In this paper, a novel technology mapping tool, called SFQmap, is
presented, which provides optimization methods for minimizing first the circuit
depth and path balancing overhead and then the worst-case stage delay of mapped
SFQ circuits. Compared with the state-of-the-art technology mappers, SFQmap
reduces the depth and path balancing overhead by an average of 14% and 31%,
respectively.
"
1390,"A Survey of Biological Building Blocks for Synthetic Molecular
  Communication Systems","  Synthetic molecular communication (MC) is a new communication engineering
paradigm which is expected to enable revolutionary applications such as smart
drug delivery and real-time health monitoring. The design and implementation of
synthetic MC systems (MCSs) at nano- and microscale is very challenging. This
is particularly true for synthetic MCSs employing biological components as
transmitters and receivers or as interfaces with natural biological MCSs.
Nevertheless, since such biological components have been optimized by nature
over billions of years, using them in synthetic MCSs is highly promising. This
paper provides a survey of biological components that can potentially serve as
the main building blocks, i.e., transmitter, receiver, and signaling particles,
for the design and implementation of synthetic MCSs. Nature uses a large
variety of signaling particles of different sizes and with vastly different
properties for communication among biological entities. Here, we focus on three
important classes of signaling particles: cations (specifically protons and
calcium ions), neurotransmitters (specifically acetylcholine, dopamine, and
serotonin), and phosphopeptides. For each of these candidate signaling
particles, we present several specific transmitter and receiver structures
mainly built upon proteins that are capable of performing the distinct
physiological functionalities required from the transmitters and receivers of
MCSs. Moreover, we present options for both microscale implementation of MCSs
as well as the micro-to-macroscale interfaces needed for experimental
evaluation of MCSs. Furthermore, we outline new research directions for the
implementation and the theoretical design and analysis of the proposed
transmitter and receiver architectures.
"
1391,Using ZDDs in the Mapping of Quantum Circuits,"  A critical step in quantum compilation is the transformation of a
technology-independent quantum circuit into a technology-dependent form for a
targeted device. In addition to mapping quantum gates into the supported gate
set, it is necessary to map pseudo qubits in the technology-independent circuit
into physical qubits of the technology-dependent circuit such that coupling
constraints among qubits acting in multiple-qubit gates are satisfied. It is
usually not possible to find such a mapping without adding SWAP gates into the
circuit. To cope with the technical limitations of NISQ-era quantum devices, it
is advantageous to find a mapping that requires as few additional gates as
possible. The large search space of possible mappings makes this task a
difficult combinatorial optimization problem. In this work, we demonstrate how
zero-suppressed decision diagrams (ZDDs) can be used for typical implementation
tasks in quantum mapping algorithms. We show how to maximally partition a
quantum circuit into blocks of adjacent gates, and if adjacent gates within a
circuit do not share common mapping permutations, we attempt to combine them
using parallelized SWAP operations represented in a ZDD. Boundaries for the
partitions are formed where adjacent gates are unable to be combined. Within
each partition block, ZDDs represent all possible mappings of pseudo qubits to
physical qubits.

1392,"SNRA: A Spintronic Neuromorphic Reconfigurable Array for In-Circuit
  Training and Evaluation of Deep Belief Networks","  In this paper, a spintronic neuromorphic reconfigurable Array (SNRA) is
developed to fuse together power-efficient probabilistic and in-field
programmable deterministic computing during both training and evaluation phases
of restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs). First, probabilistic spin logic
devices are used to develop an RBM realization which is adapted to construct
deep belief networks (DBNs) having one to three hidden layers of size 10 to 800
neurons each. Second, we design a hardware implementation for the contrastive
divergence (CD) algorithm using a four-state finite state machine capable of
unsupervised training in N+3 clocks where N denotes the number of neurons in
each RBM. The functionality of our proposed CD hardware implementation is
validated using ModelSim simulations. We synthesize the developed Verilog HDL
implementation of our proposed test/train control circuitry for various DBN
topologies where the maximal RBM dimensions yield resource utilization ranging
from 51 to 2,421 lookup tables (LUTs). Next, we leverage spin Hall effect
(SHE)-magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) based non-volatile LUTs circuits as an
alternative for static random access memory (SRAM)-based LUTs storing the
deterministic logic configuration to form a reconfigurable fabric. Finally, we
compare the performance of our proposed SNRA with SRAM-based configurable
fabrics focusing on the area and power consumption induced by the LUTs used to
implement both CD and evaluation modes. The results obtained indicate more than
80% reduction in combined dynamic and static power dissipation, while achieving
at least 50% reduction in device count.

1393,An Optical Frontend for a Convolutional Neural Network,"  The parallelism of optics and the miniaturization of optical components using
nanophotonic structures, such as metasurfaces present a compelling alternative
to electronic implementations of convolutional neural networks. The lack of a
low-power optical nonlinearity, however, requires slow and energy-inefficient
conversions between the electronic and optical domains. Here, we design an
architecture which utilizes a single electrical to optical conversion by
designing a free-space optical frontend unit that implements the linear
operations of the first layer with the subsequent layers realized
electronically. Speed and power analysis of the architecture indicates that the
hybrid photonic-electronic architecture outperforms sole electronic
architecture for large image sizes and kernels. Benchmarking of the
photonic-electronic architecture on a modified version of AlexNet achieves a
classification accuracy of 87% on images from the Kaggle Cats and Dogs
challenge database.
"
1394,Low-Power Neuromorphic Hardware for Signal Processing Applications,"  Machine learning has emerged as the dominant tool for implementing complex
cognitive tasks that require supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement
learning. While the resulting machines have demonstrated in some cases even
super-human performance, their energy consumption has often proved to be
prohibitive in the absence of costly super-computers. Most state-of-the-art
machine learning solutions are based on memory-less models of neurons. This is
unlike the neurons in the human brain, which encode and process information
using temporal information in spike events. The different computing principles
underlying biological neurons and how they combine together to efficiently
process information is believed to be a key factor behind their superior
efficiency compared to current machine learning systems. Inspired by the
time-encoding mechanism used by the brain, third generation spiking neural
networks (SNNs) are being studied for building a new class of information
processing engines.
  Modern computing systems based on the von Neumann architecture, however, are
ill-suited for efficiently implementing SNNs, since their performance is
limited by the need to constantly shuttle data between physically separated
logic and memory units. Hence, novel computational architectures that address
the von Neumann bottleneck are necessary in order to build systems that can
implement SNNs with low energy budgets. In this paper, we review some of the
architectural and system level design aspects involved in developing a new
class of brain-inspired information processing engines that mimic the
time-based information encoding and processing aspects of the brain.

1395,"Thermal switch of oscillation frequency in Belousov-Zhabotinsky liquid
  marbles","  External control of oscillation dynamics in the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction
is important for many applications including encoding computing schemes. When
considering the BZ reaction there are limited studies dealing with thermal
cycling, particularly cooling, for external control. Recently, liquid marbles
(LMs) have been demonstrated as a means of confining the Belousov-Zhabotinsky
reaction in a system containing a solid-liquid interface. BZ LMs were prepared
by rolling 50 {\mu}l droplets in polyethylene (PE) powder. Oscillations of
electrical potential differences within the marble were recorded by inserting a
pair of electrodes through the LM powder coating into the BZ solution core.
Electrical potential differences of up to 100mV were observed with an average
period of oscillation ca. 44 s. BZ LMs were subsequently frozen to -1oC to
observe changes in the frequency of electrical potential oscillations. The
frequency of oscillations reduced upon freezing to 11mHz cf. 23mHz at ambient
temperature. The oscillation frequency of the frozen BZ LM returned to 23mHz
upon warming to ambient temperature. Several cycles of frequency fluctuations
were able to be achieved.
"
1396,On complexity of branching droplets in electrical field,"  Decanol droplets in a thin layer of sodium decanoate with sodium chloride
exhibit bifurcation branching growth due to interplay between osmotic pressure,
diffusion and surface tension. We aimed to evaluate if morphology of the
branching droplets changes when the droplets are subject to electrical
potential difference. We analysed graph-theoretic structure of the droplets and
applied several complexity measures. We found that, in overall, the current
increases complexity of the branching droplets in terms of number of connected
components and nodes in their graph presentations, morphological complexity and
compressibility.
"
1397,"Fully Memristive Spiking-Neuron Learning Framework and its Applications
  on Pattern Recognition and Edge Detection","  Fully memristive spiking-neuron learning framework, which uses drift and
diffusion memristor models as axon and dendrite respectively, becomes a hot
topic recently with the development of memristor devices. Normally, some other
devices like resistor or capacitor are still necessary on recent works of fully
memristive learning framework. However, theoretically, one neuron needs axon
and dendrite only, which makes technique process simpler and learning framework
more similar to biologic brain. In this paper, a fully memristive
spiking-neuron learning framework is introduced, in which a neuron structure is
just built of one drift and one diffusion memristive models. To verify it
merits, a feedforward neural network for pattern recognition and a cellular
neural network for edge detection are designed. Experiment results show that
compared to other memristive neural networks, our framework's the processing
speed is much faster and the hardware resource is saved in pattern recognition
due to its simple structure. Further due to the dynamic filtering function of
diffusion memristor model in our learning framework, its peak signal noise
ratio (PSNR) is much higher than traditional algorithms in edge detection.
"
1398,"Training neural nets to learn reactive potential energy surfaces using
  interactive quantum chemistry in virtual reality","  Whilst the primary bottleneck to a number of computational workflows was not
so long ago limited by processing power, the rise of machine learning
technologies has resulted in a paradigm shift which places increasing value on
issues related to data curation - i.e., data size, quality, bias, format, and
coverage. Increasingly, data-related issues are equally as important as the
algorithmic methods used to process and learn from the data. Here we introduce
an open source GPU-accelerated neural network (NN) framework for learning
reactive potential energy surfaces (PESs), and investigate the use of real-time
interactive ab initio molecular dynamics in virtual reality (iMD-VR) as a new
strategy for rapidly sampling geometries along reaction pathways which can be
used to train NNs to learn reactive PESs. Focussing on hydrogen abstraction
reactions of CN radical with isopentane, we compare the performance of NNs
trained using iMD-VR data versus NNs trained using a more traditional method,
namely molecular dynamics (MD) constrained to sample a predefined grid of
points along hydrogen abstraction reaction coordinates. Both the NN trained
using iMD-VR data and the NN trained using the constrained MD data reproduce
important qualitative features of the reactive PESs, such as a low and early
barrier to abstraction. Quantitatively, learning is sensitive to the training
dataset. Our results show that user-sampled structures obtained with the
quantum chemical iMD-VR machinery enable better sampling in the vicinity of the
minimum energy path (MEP). As a result, the NN trained on the iMD-VR data does
very well predicting energies in the vicinity of the MEP, but less well
predicting energies for 'off-path' structures. The NN trained on the
constrained MD data does better in predicting energies for 'off-path'
structures, given that it included a number of such structures in its training
set.
"
1399,The pH sensitivity of solvated tectomer electronics,"  Colloidal liquid robotics with embodied intelligence solutions mimicking
biologic systems, in response to the future increasingly distributed sensing
and the resulting data to be managed, has been proposed as the next cybernetic
paradigm. Solutions for data storage and readout in liquido require a physical
structure able to change configuration under electrical stimuli. We propose
tectomers as a candidate for such an adaptive structure. A tectomer is a
oligomer made of few oligoglycine units with a common centre. Tectomers undergo
pH dependent assembly in a single layer supramers. Tectomers represent a stable
paradigm, in their amorphous or crystalline forms, reversibly influenced by
solution pH, whose electronic properties are studied herein.
"
1400,"Channel Sensing in Molecular Communications with Single Type of Ligand
  Receptors","  Molecular Communications (MC) uses molecules as information carriers between
nanomachines. MC channel in practice can be crowded with different types of
molecules, i.e., ligands, which can have similar binding properties causing
severe cross-talk on ligand receptors. Simultaneous sensing of multiple ligand
types provides opportunities for eliminating interference of external molecular
sources and multi-user interference (MUI), and developing new multiple access
techniques for MC nanonetworks. In this paper, we investigate channel sensing
methods that use only a single type of receptors and exploit the amount of time
receptors stay bound and unbound during ligand-receptor binding reaction to
concurrently estimate the concentration of multiple types of ligands. We derive
the Cram\'er-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) for multi-ligand estimation, and propose
practical and low-complexity suboptimal estimators for channel sensing. We
analyze the performance of the proposed methods in terms of normalized mean
squared error (NMSE), and show that they can efficiently estimate the
concentration of ligands up to $10$ different types with an average NMSE far
below $10^{-2}$. Lastly, we propose a synthetic receptor design based on
modified kinetic proofreading (KPR) scheme to sample the unbound and bound time
durations, and a Chemical Reaction Network (CRN) to perform the required
computations in synthetic cells.
"
1401,"Transmitter and Receiver Architectures for Molecular Communications: A
  Survey on Physical Design with Modulation, Coding and Detection Techniques","  Inspired by Nature, molecular communications (MC), i.e., use of molecules to
encode, transmit and receive information, stands as the most promising
communication paradigm to realize nanonetworks. Even though there has been
extensive theoretical research towards nanoscale MC, there are no examples of
implemented nanoscale MC networks. The main reason for this lies in the
peculiarities of nanoscale physics, challenges in nanoscale fabrication and
highly stochastic nature of biochemical domain of envisioned nanonetwork
applications. This mandates developing novel device architectures and
communication methods compatible with MC constraints. To that end, various
transmitter and receiver designs for MC have been proposed in literature
together with numerable modulation, coding and detection techniques. However,
these works fall into domains of a very wide spectrum of disciplines, including
but not limited to information and communication theory, quantum physics,
materials science, nanofabrication, physiology and synthetic biology.
Therefore, we believe it is imperative for the progress of the field that, an
organized exposition of cumulative knowledge on subject matter be compiled.
Thus, to fill this gap, in this comprehensive survey we review the existing
literature on transmitter and receiver architectures towards realizing MC
amongst nanomaterial-based nanomachines and/or biological entities, and provide
a complete overview of modulation, coding and detection techniques employed for
MC. Moreover, we identify the most significant shortcomings and challenges in
all these research areas, and propose potential solutions to overcome some of
them.
"
1402,"BioSEAL: In-Memory Biological Sequence Alignment Accelerator for
  Large-Scale Genomic Data","  Genome sequences contain hundreds of millions of DNA base pairs. Finding the
degree of similarity between two genomes requires executing a compute-intensive
dynamic programming algorithm, such as Smith-Waterman. Traditional von Neumann
architectures have limited parallelism and cannot provide an efficient solution
for large-scale genomic data. Approximate heuristic methods (e.g. BLAST) are
commonly used. However, they are suboptimal and still compute-intensive. In
this work, we present BioSEAL, a Biological SEquence ALignment accelerator.
BioSEAL is a massively parallel non-von Neumann processing-in-memory
architecture for large-scale DNA and protein sequence alignment. BioSEAL is
based on resistive content addressable memory, capable of energy-efficient and
high-performance associative processing. We present an associative processing
algorithm for entire database sequence alignment on BioSEAL and compare its
performance and power consumption with state-of-art solutions. We show that
BioSEAL can achieve up to 57x speedup and 156x better energy efficiency,
compared with existing solutions for genome sequence alignment and protein
sequence database search.

1403,"RDCSim: a GPU-Accelerated, Interactive Simulator for Reaction--Diffusion
  Chemistry","  This paper presents RDCSim, an interactive simulator for reaction--diffusion
chemistry (RDC) research, being developed as part of an ongoing project
studying how humans interact with unconventional computing systems.
  While much research into the computational properties of RDC makes use of
simulations, the development of multiple RDC simulations across different
research groups can lead to results that are harder to reproduce. By automating
the storage of parameter values alongside simulation results, RDCSim aims to
make reproducing RDC results painless.
  This paper presents the functionality of RDCSim, and verifies the behaviour
of the underlying chemical simulation using two seminal examples from the RDC
literature: logical AND gates and chemical diodes.
"
1404,"Pegasus: The second connectivity graph for large-scale quantum annealing
  hardware","  Pegasus is a graph which offers substantially increased connectivity between
the qubits of quantum annealing hardware compared to the graph Chimera. It is
the first fundamental change in the connectivity graph of quantum annealers
built by D-Wave since Chimera was introduced in 2009 and then used in 2011 for
D-Wave's first commercial quantum annealer. In this article we describe an
algorithm which defines the connectivity of Pegasus and we provide what we
believe to be the best way to graphically visualize Pegasus in order to see
which qubits couple to each other. As supplemental material, we provide a wide
variety of different visualizations of Pegasus which expose different
properties of the graph in different ways. We provide an open source code for
generating the many depictions of Pegasus that we show.
"
1405,Embedding quadratization gadgets on Chimera and Pegasus graphs,"  We group all known quadratizations of cubic and quartic terms in binary
optimization problems into six and seven unique graphs respectively. We then
perform a minor embedding of these graphs onto the well-known Chimera graph,
and the brand new Pegasus graph. We conclude with recommendations for which
gadgets are best to use when aiming to reduce the total number of qubits
required to embed a problem.
"
1406,Approximation Techniques for Stochastic Analysis of Biological Systems,"  There has been an increasing demand for formal methods in the design process
of safety-critical synthetic genetic circuits. Probabilistic model checking
techniques have demonstrated significant potential in analyzing the intrinsic
probabilistic behaviors of complex genetic circuit designs. However, its
inability to scale limits its applicability in practice. This chapter addresses
the scalability problem by presenting a state-space approximation method to
remove unlikely states resulting in a reduced, finite state representation of
the infinite-state continuous-time Markov chain that is amenable to
probabilistic model checking. The proposed method is evaluated on a design of a
genetic toggle switch. Comparisons with another state-of-art tool demonstrates
both accuracy and efficiency of the presented method.
"
1407,"Physical reservoir computing built by spintronic devices for temporal
  information processing","  Spintronic nanodevices have ultrafast nonlinear dynamic and recurrence
behaviors on a nanosecond scale that promises to enable spintronic reservoir
computing (RC) system. Here two physical RC systems based on a single magnetic
skyrmion memristor (MSM) and 24 spin-torque nano-oscillators (STNOs) were
proposed and modeled to process image classification task and nonlinear dynamic
system prediction, respectively. Based on our micromagnetic simulation results
on the nonlinear responses of MSM and STNO with current pulses stimulation, the
handwritten digits recognition task domesticates that an RC system using one
single MSM has the outstanding performance on image classification. In
addition, the complex unknown nonlinear dynamic problems can also be well
solved by a physical RC system consisted of 24 STNOs confirmed in a
second-order nonlinear dynamic system and NARMA10 tasks. The capability of both
high accuracy and fast information processing promises to enable one type of
brain-like chip based on spintronics for various artificial intelligence tasks.
"
1408,Hybrid 2D/3D photonic integration for non-planar circuit topologies,"  Complex photonic integrated circuits (PIC) may have strongly non-planar
topologies that require waveguide crossings (WGX) when realized in single-layer
integration platforms. The number of WGX increases rapidly with the complexity
of the circuit, in particular when it comes to highly interconnected optical
switch topologies. Here, we present a concept for WGX-free PIC that rely on
3D-printed freeform waveguide overpasses (WOP). We experimentally demonstrate
the viability of our approach using the example of a $4 \times 4$
switch-and-select (SAS) circuit realized on the silicon photonic platform. We
further present a comprehensive graph-theoretical analysis of different $n
\times n$ SAS circuit topologies. We find that for increasing port counts $n$
of the SAS circuit, the number of WGX increases with $n^4$, whereas the number
of WOP increases only in proportion to $n^2$.
"
1409,"FPSA: A Full System Stack Solution for Reconfigurable ReRAM-based NN
  Accelerator Architecture","  Neural Network (NN) accelerators with emerging ReRAM (resistive random access
memory) technologies have been investigated as one of the promising solutions
to address the \textit{memory wall} challenge, due to the unique capability of
\textit{processing-in-memory} within ReRAM-crossbar-based processing elements
(PEs). However, the high efficiency and high density advantages of ReRAM have
not been fully utilized due to the huge communication demands among PEs and the
overhead of peripheral circuits.
  In this paper, we propose a full system stack solution, composed of a
reconfigurable architecture design, Field Programmable Synapse Array (FPSA) and
its software system including neural synthesizer, temporal-to-spatial mapper,
and placement & routing. We highly leverage the software system to make the
hardware design compact and efficient. To satisfy the high-performance
communication demand, we optimize it with a reconfigurable routing architecture
and the placement & routing tool. To improve the computational density, we
greatly simplify the PE circuit with the spiking schema and then adopt neural
synthesizer to enable the high density computation-resources to support
different kinds of NN operations. In addition, we provide spiking memory blocks
(SMBs) and configurable logic blocks (CLBs) in hardware and leverage the
temporal-to-spatial mapper to utilize them to balance the storage and
computation requirements of NN. Owing to the end-to-end software system, we can
efficiently deploy existing deep neural networks to FPSA. Evaluations show
that, compared to one of state-of-the-art ReRAM-based NN accelerators, PRIME,
the computational density of FPSA improves by 31x; for representative NNs, its
inference performance can achieve up to 1000x speedup.
"
1410,ReQWIRE: Reasoning about Reversible Quantum Circuits,"  Common quantum algorithms make heavy use of ancillae: scratch qubits that are
initialized at some state and later returned to that state and discarded.
Existing quantum circuit languages let programmers assert that a qubit has been
returned to the |0> state before it is discarded, allowing for a range of
optimizations. However, existing languages do not provide the tools to verify
these assertions, introducing a potential source of errors. In this paper we
present methods for verifying that ancillae are discarded in the desired state,
and use these methods to implement a verified compiler from classical functions
to quantum oracles.
"
1411,Physical Foundations of Landauer's Principle,"  We review the physical foundations of Landauer's Principle, which relates the
loss of information from a computational process to an increase in
thermodynamic entropy. Despite the long history of the Principle, its
fundamental rationale and proper interpretation remain frequently
misunderstood. Contrary to some misinterpretations of the Principle, the mere
transfer of entropy between computational and non-computational subsystems can
occur in a thermodynamically reversible way without increasing total entropy.
However, Landauer's Principle is not about general entropy transfers; rather,
it more specifically concerns the ejection of (all or part of) some correlated
information from a controlled, digital form (e.g., a computed bit) to an
uncontrolled, non-computational form, i.e., as part of a thermal environment.
Any uncontrolled thermal system will, by definition, continually re-randomize
the physical information in its thermal state, from our perspective as
observers who cannot predict the exact dynamical evolution of the microstates
of such environments. Thus, any correlations involving information that is
ejected into and subsequently thermalized by the environment will be lost from
our perspective, resulting directly in an irreversible increase in total
entropy. Avoiding the ejection and thermalization of correlated computational
information motivates the reversible computing paradigm, although the
requirements for computations to be thermodynamically reversible are less
restrictive than frequently described, particularly in the case of stochastic
computational operations. There are interesting possibilities for the design of
computational processes that utilize stochastic, many-to-one computational
operations while nevertheless avoiding net entropy increase that remain to be
fully explored.
"
1412,"PUMA: A Programmable Ultra-efficient Memristor-based Accelerator for
  Machine Learning Inference","  Memristor crossbars are circuits capable of performing analog matrix-vector
multiplications, overcoming the fundamental energy efficiency limitations of
digital logic. They have been shown to be effective in special-purpose
accelerators for a limited set of neural network applications.
  We present the Programmable Ultra-efficient Memristor-based Accelerator
(PUMA) which enhances memristor crossbars with general purpose execution units
to enable the acceleration of a wide variety of Machine Learning (ML) inference
workloads. PUMA's microarchitecture techniques exposed through a specialized
Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) retain the efficiency of in-memory computing
and analog circuitry, without compromising programmability.
  We also present the PUMA compiler which translates high-level code to PUMA
ISA. The compiler partitions the computational graph and optimizes instruction
scheduling and register allocation to generate code for large and complex
workloads to run on thousands of spatial cores.
  We have developed a detailed architecture simulator that incorporates the
functionality, timing, and power models of PUMA's components to evaluate
performance and energy consumption. A PUMA accelerator running at 1 GHz can
reach area and power efficiency of $577~GOPS/s/mm^2$ and $837~GOPS/s/W$,
respectively. Our evaluation of diverse ML applications from image recognition,
machine translation, and language modelling (5M-800M synapses) shows that PUMA
achieves up to $2,446\times$ energy and $66\times$ latency improvement for
inference compared to state-of-the-art GPUs. Compared to an
application-specific memristor-based accelerator, PUMA incurs small energy
overheads at similar inference latency and added programmability.
"
1413,Using Floating Gate Memory to Train Ideal Accuracy Neural Networks,"  Floating gate SONOS (Silicon-Oxygen-Nitrogen-Oxygen-Silicon) transistors can
be used to train neural networks to ideal accuracies that match those of
floating point digital weights on the MNIST dataset when using multiple devices
to represent a weight or within 1% of ideal accuracy when using a single
device. This is enabled by operating devices in the subthreshold regime, where
they exhibit symmetric write nonlinearities. A neural training accelerator core
based on SONOS with a single device per weight would increase energy efficiency
by 120X, operate 2.1X faster and require 5X lower area than an optimized SRAM
based ASIC.
"
1414,A QUBO Model for Gaussian Process Variance Reduction,"  Gaussian Processes are used in many applications to model spatial phenomena.
Within this context, a key issue is to decide the set of locations where to
take measurements so as to obtain a better approximation of the underlying
function. Current state of the art techniques select such set to minimize the
posterior variance of the Gaussian process. We explore the feasibility of
solving this problem by proposing a novel Quadratic Unconstrained Binary
Optimization (QUBO) model. In recent years this QUBO formulation has gained
increasing attention since it represents the input for the specialized quantum
annealer D-Wave machines. Hence, our contribution takes an important first step
towards the sampling optimization of Gaussian processes in the context of
quantum computation. Results of our empirical evaluation shows that the optimum
of the QUBO objective function we derived represents a good solution for the
above mentioned problem. In fact we are able to obtain comparable and in some
cases better results than the widely used submodular technique.
"
1415,Signal reconstruction in diffusion-based molecular communication,"  Molecular Communication (MC) is an important nanoscale communication
paradigm, which is employed for the interconnection of the nanomachines (NMs)
to form nanonetworks. A transmitter NM (TN) sends the information symbols by
emitting molecules into the transmission medium and a receiver NM (RN) receives
the information symbols by sensing the molecule concentration. In this paper, a
model of how a RN measures and reconstructs the molecular signal is proposed.
The signal around the RN is assumed to be a Gaussian random process instead of
deterministic approach in a more realistic way. After the reconstructed signal
is derived as a Doubly Stochastic Poisson Process (DSPP), the distortion
between the signal around the RN and the reconstructed signal is derived as a
new performance parameter in MC systems. The derived distortion which is a
function of system parameters such as RN radius, sampling period and the
diffusion coefficient of the channel, is shown to be valid by employing random
walk simulations. Then, it is shown that the original signal can be
satisfactorily reconstructed with a sufficiently low-level of distortion.
Finally, optimum RN design parameters, namely RN radius, sampling period and
sampling frequency, are derived by minimizing the signal distortion. The
simulation results reveal that there is a trade-off among the RN design
parameters which can be jointly set for a desired signal distortion.
"
1416,Function Maximization with Dynamic Quantum Search,"  Finding the maximum value of a function in a dynamic model plays an important
role in many application settings, including discrete optimization in the
presence of hard constraints. We present an iterative quantum algorithm for
finding the maximum value of a function in which prior search results update
the acceptable response. Our approach is based on quantum search and utilizes a
dynamic oracle function to mark items in a specified input set. As a
realization of function optimization, we verify the correctness of the
algorithm using numerical simulations of quantum circuits for the Knapsack
problem. Our simulations make use of an explicit oracle function based on
arithmetic operations and a comparator subroutine, and we verify these
implementations using numerical simulations up to 30 qubits.
"
1417,"SurfBraid: A concept tool for preparing and resource estimating quantum
  circuits protected by the surface code","  The first generations of quantum computers will execute fault-tolerant
quantum circuits, and it is very likely that such circuits will use surface
quantum error correcting codes. To the best of our knowledge, no complete
design automation tool for such circuits is currently available. This is to a
large extent because such circuits have three dimensional layouts (e.g. two
dimensional hardware and time axis as a third dimension) and their optimisation
is still ongoing research. This work introduces SurfBraid, a tool for the
automatic design of surface code protected quantum circuits -- it includes a
complete workflow that compiles an arbitrary quantum circuit into an
intermediary Clifford+T equivalent representation which is further synthesised
and optimised to surface code protected structures (for the moment, braided
defects). SurfBraid is arguably the first flexible (modular structure,
extensible through user provided scripts) and interactive (automatically
updating the results based on user interaction, browser based) tool for such
circuits. One of the prototype's methodological novelty is its capability to
automatically estimate the resources necessary for executing large
fault-tolerant circuits. A prototype implementation and the corresponding
source code are available at https://alexandrupaler.github.io/quantjs/.

1418,"In-Memory and Error-Immune Differential RRAM Implementation of Binarized
  Deep Neural Networks","  RRAM-based in-Memory Computing is an exciting road for implementing highly
energy efficient neural networks. This vision is however challenged by RRAM
variability, as the efficient implementation of in-memory computing does not
allow error correction. In this work, we fabricated and tested a differential
HfO2-based memory structure and its associated sense circuitry, which are ideal
for in-memory computing. For the first time, we show that our approach achieves
the same reliability benefits as error correction, but without any CMOS
overhead. We show, also for the first time, that it can naturally implement
Binarized Deep Neural Networks, a very recent development of Artificial
Intelligence, with extreme energy efficiency, and that the system is fully
satisfactory for image recognition applications. Finally, we evidence how the
extra reliability provided by the differential memory allows programming the
devices in low voltage conditions, where they feature high endurance of
billions of cycles.
"
1419,Integrated magnonic half-adder,"  Spin waves and their quanta magnons open up a promising branch of high-speed
and low-power information processing. Several important milestones were
achieved recently in the realization of separate magnonic data processing units
including logic gates, a magnon transistor and units for non-Boolean computing.
Nevertheless, the realization of an integrated magnonic circuit consisting of
at least two logic gates and suitable for further integration is still an
unresolved challenge. Here we demonstrate such an integrated circuit
numerically on the example of a magnonic half-adder. Its key element is a
nonlinear directional coupler serving as combined XOR and AND logic gate that
utilizes the dependence of the spin wave dispersion on its amplitude. The
circuit constitutes of only three planar nano-waveguides and processes all
information within the magnon domain. Benchmarking of the proposed device is
performed showing the potential for sub-aJ energy consumption per operation.
"
1420,"Low Barrier Magnet Design for Efficient Hardware Binary Stochastic
  Neurons","  Binary stochastic neurons (BSN's) form an integral part of many machine
learning algorithms, motivating the development of hardware accelerators for
this complex function. It has been recognized that hardware BSN's can be
implemented using low barrier magnets (LBM's) by minimally modifying
present-day magnetoresistive random access memory (MRAM) devices. A crucial
parameter that determines the response of these LBM based BSN designs is the
\emph{correlation time} of magnetization, $\tau_c$. In this letter, we show
that for magnets with low energy barriers ($\Delta \approx k_BT$ and below),
circular disk magnets with in-plane magnetic anisotropy (IMA) lead to $\tau_c$
values that are two orders of magnitude smaller compared to $\tau_c$ for
magnets having perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) and provide analytical
descriptions. We show that this striking difference in $\tau_c$ is due to a
precession-like fluctuation mechanism that is enabled by the large
demagnetization field in IMA magnets. We provide a detailed energy-delay
performance evaluation of previously proposed BSN designs based on
Spin-Orbit-Torque (SOT) MRAM and Spin-Transfer-Torque (STT) MRAM employing low
barrier circular IMA magnets by SPICE simulations. The designs exhibit sub-ns
response times leading to energy requirements of $\sim$a few fJ to evaluate the
BSN function, orders of magnitude lower than digital CMOS implementations with
a much larger footprint. While modern MRAM technology is based on PMA magnets,
results in this paper suggest that low barrier circular IMA magnets may be more
suitable for this application.
"
1421,Reliable quantum circuits have defects,"  State of the art quantum computing architectures are founded on the decision
to use scalable but faulty quantum hardware in conjunction with an efficient
error correcting code capable of tolerating high error rates. The promised
effect of this decision is that the first large-scale practical quantum
computer is within reach. Coming to grips with the strategy and the challenges
of preparing reliable executions of an arbitrary quantum computation is not
difficult. Moreover, the article explains why defects are good.

1422,"Graver Bases via Quantum Annealing with Application to Non-Linear
  Integer Programs","  We propose a novel hybrid quantum-classical approach to calculate Graver
bases, which have the potential to solve a variety of hard linear and
non-linear integer programs, as they form a test set (optimality certificate)
with very appealing properties. The calculation of Graver bases is
exponentially hard (in general) on classical computers, so they not used for
solving practical problems on commercial solvers. With a quantum annealer,
however, it may be a viable approach to use them. We test two hybrid
quantum-classical algorithms (on D-Wave)--one for computing Graver basis and a
second for optimizing non-linear integer programs that utilize Graver bases--to
understand the strengths and limitations of the practical quantum annealers
available today. Our experiments suggest that with a modest increase in coupler
precision--along with near-term improvements in the number of qubits and
connectivity (density of hardware graph) that are expected--the ability to
outperform classical best-in-class algorithms is within reach, with respect to
non-linear integer optimization.
"
1423,On Conflict Free DNA Codes,"  DNA storage has emerged as an important area of research. The reliability of
DNA storage system depends on designing the DNA strings (called DNA codes) that
are sufficiently dissimilar. In this work, we introduce DNA codes that satisfy
a special constraint. Each codeword of the DNA code has a specific property
that any two consecutive sub-strings of the DNA codeword will not be the same
(a generalization of homo-polymers constraint). This is in addition to the
usual constraints such as Hamming, reverse, reverse-complement and
$GC$-content. We believe that the new constraint will help further in reducing
the errors during reading and writing data into the synthetic DNA strings. We
also present a construction (based on a variant of stochastic local search
algorithm) to calculate the size of the DNA codes with all the above
constraints, which improves the lower bounds from the existing literature, for
some specific cases. Moreover, a recursive isometric map between binary vectors
and DNA strings is proposed. Using the map and the well known binary codes we
obtain few classes of DNA codes with all the constraints including the property
that the constructed DNA codewords are free from the hairpin-like secondary
structures.
"
1424,A Case for Superconducting Accelerators,"  As the scaling of conventional CMOS-based technologies slows down, there is
growing interest in alternative technologies that can improve performance or
energy-efficiency. Superconducting circuits based on Josephson Junction (JJ) is
an emerging technology that can provide devices which can be switched with
pico-second latencies and consuming two orders of magnitude lower switching
energy compared to CMOS. While JJ-based circuits can provide high operating
frequency and energy-efficiency, this technology faces three critical
challenges: limited device density and lack of area-efficient technology for
memory structures, reduced gate fanout compared to CMOS, and new failure modes
of Flux-Traps that occurs due to the operating environment.
  The lack of dense memory technology restricts the use of superconducting
technology in the near term to application domains that have high compute
intensity but require negligible amount of memory. In this paper, we study the
use of superconducting technology to build an accelerator for SHA-256 engines
commonly used in Bitcoin mining applications. We show that merely porting
existing CMOS-based accelerator to superconducting technology provides 10.6X
improvement in energy efficiency. Redesigning the accelerator to suit the
unique constraints of superconducting technology (such as low fanout) improves
the energy efficiency to 12.2X. We also investigate solutions to make the
accelerator tolerant of new fault modes and show how this fault-tolerant design
can be leveraged to reduce the operating current, thereby increasing the
overall energy-efficiency to 46X compared to CMOS. Our paper also develops a
workflow for evaluating area, performance, and power for accelerators built in
superconducting technology, and this workflow can help other researchers
explore designs using this technology.
"
1425,Assessing Solution Quality of 3SAT on a Quantum Annealing Platform,"  When solving propositional logic satisfiability (specifically 3SAT) using
quantum annealing, we analyze the effect the difficulty of different instances
of the problem has on the quality of the answer returned by the quantum
annealer. A high-quality response from the annealer in this case is defined by
a high percentage of correct solutions among the returned answers. We show that
the phase transition regarding the computational complexity of the problem,
which is well-known to occur for 3SAT on classical machines (where it causes a
detrimental increase in runtime), persists in some form (but possibly to a
lesser extent) for quantum annealing.
"
1426,Some Interesting Features of Memristor CNN,"  In this paper, we introduce some interesting features of a memristor CNN
(Cellular Neural Network). We first show that there is the similarity between
the dynamics of memristors and neurons. That is, some kind of flux-controlled
memristors can not respond to the sinusoidal voltage source quickly, namely,
they can not switch `on' rapidly. Furthermore, these memristors have refractory
period after switch `on', which means that it can not respond to further
sinusoidal inputs until the flux is decreased. We next show that the
memristor-coupled two-cell CNN can exhibit chaotic behavior. In this system,
the memristors switch `off' and `on' at irregular intervals, and the two cells
are connected when either or both of the memristors switches `on'. We then
propose the modified CNN model, which can hold a binary output image, even if
all cells are disconnected and no signal is supplied to the cell after a
certain point of time. However, the modified CNN requires power to maintain the
output image, that is, it is volatile. We next propose a new memristor CNN
model. It can also hold a binary output state (image), even if all cells are
disconnected, and no signal is supplied to the cell, by memristor's switching
behavior. Furthermore, even if we turn off the power of the system during the
computation, it can resume from the previous average output state, since the
memristor CNN has functions of both short-term (volatile) memory and long-term
(non-volatile) memory. The above suspend and resume feature are useful when we
want to save the current state, and continue work later from the previous
state. Finally, we show that the memristor CNN can exhibit interesting
two-dimensional waves, if an inductor is connected to each memristor CNN cell.
"
1427,Coupled nonlinear delay systems as deep convolutional neural networks,"  Neural networks are currently transforming the field of computer algorithms,
yet their emulation on current computing substrates is highly inefficient.
Reservoir computing was successfully implemented on a large variety of
substrates and gave new insight in overcoming this implementation bottleneck.
Despite its success, the approach lags behind the state of the art in deep
learning. We therefore extend time-delay reservoirs to deep networks and
demonstrate that these conceptually correspond to deep convolutional neural
networks. Convolution is intrinsically realized on a substrate level by generic
drive-response properties of dynamical systems. The resulting novelty is
avoiding vector-matrix products between layers, which cause low efficiency in
today's substrates. Compared to singleton time-delay reservoirs, our deep
network achieves accuracy improvements by at least an order of magnitude in
Mackey-Glass and Lorenz timeseries prediction.
"
1428,"Applying Multi-qubit Correction to Frustrated Cluster Loops on an
  Adiabatic Quantum Computer","  The class of problems represented by frustrated cluster loops, FCL, is a
robust set of problems that spans a wide range of computational difficulty and
that are easy to determine what their solutions are. Here, we use frustrated
cluster loops to test the relative performance of the D-Wave without
post-processing and the D-Wave with multi-qubit correction (MQC)
post-processing. MQC post-processing has shown itself exceptionally beneficial
in improving the performance of the D-Wave 2000Q when processing difficult FCL
problems.
"
1429,"Synthesizing Number Generators for Stochastic Computing using Mixed
  Integer Programming","  Stochastic computing (SC) is a high density, low-power computation technique
which encodes values as unary bitstreams instead of binary-encoded (BE) values.
Practical SC implementations require deterministic or pseudo-random number
sequences which are optimally correlated to generate bitstreams and achieve
accurate results. Unfortunately, the size of the search space makes manually
designing optimally correlated number sequences a difficult task. To automate
this design burden, we propose a synthesis formulation using mixed integer
programming to automatically generate optimally correlated number sequences. In
particular, our synthesis formulation improves the accuracy of arithmetic
operations such as multiplication and squaring circuits by up to 2.5x and 20x
respectively. We also show how our technique can be extended to scale to larger
circuits.
"
1430,Robustness and Games Against Nature in Molecular Programming,"  Matter, especially DNA, is now programmed to carry out useful processes at
the nanoscale. As these programs and processes become more complex and their
envisioned safety-critical applications approach deployment, it is essential to
develop methods for engineering trustworthiness into molecular programs. Some
of this can be achieved by adapting existing software engineering methods, but
molecular programming also presents new challenges that will require new
methods. This paper presents a method for dealing with one such challenge,
namely, the difficulty of ascertaining how robust a molecular program is to
perturbations of the relative ""clock speeds"" of its various reactions. The
method proposed here is game-theoretic. The robustness of a molecular program
is quantified in terms of its ability to win (achieve its original objective)
in games against other molecular programs that manipulate its relative clock
speeds. This game-theoretic approach is general enough to quantify the security
of a molecular program against malicious manipulations of its relative clock
speeds. However, this preliminary report focuses on games against nature, games
in which the molecular program's opponent perturbs clock speeds randomly
(indifferently) according to the probabilities inherent in chemical kinetics.
"
1431,"A Reed Muller-based approach for optimization of general binary quantum
  multiplexers","  Previous work has provided methods for decomposing unitary matrices to series
of quantum multiplexers, but the multiplexers created in this way are highly
non-minimal. This paper presents a new approach for optimizing quantum
multiplexers with arbitrary single-qubit quantum target functions. For quantum
multiplexers, we define standard forms and two types of new forms: fixed
polarity quantum forms (FPQF) and Kronecker quantum forms (KQF), which are
analogous to Minterm Sum of Products forms, Fixed Polarity Reed-Muller (FPRM)
forms, and Kronecker Reed-Muller (KRM) forms, respectively, for classical logic
functions. Drawing inspiration from the usage of butterfly diagrams for FPRM
and KRM forms, we devise a method to exhaustively construct all FPQF and KQF
forms. Thus, the new forms can be used to optimize quantum circuits with
arbitrary target unitary matrices, rather than only multi-controlled NOT gates
such as CNOT, CCNOT, and their extensions. Experimental results on FPQF and KQF
forms, as well as FPRM and KRM classical forms, applied to various target gates
such as NOT, V, V+, Hadamard, and Pauli rotations, demonstrate that FPQF and
KQF forms greatly reduce the gate cost of quantum multiplexers in both randomly
generated data and FPRM benchmarks.
"
1432,"SPINBIS: Spintronics based Bayesian Inference System with Stochastic
  Computing","  Bayesian inference is an effective approach for solving statistical learning
problems, especially with uncertainty and incompleteness. However, Bayesian
inference is a computing-intensive task whose efficiency is physically limited
by the bottlenecks of conventional computing platforms. In this work, a
spintronics based stochastic computing approach is proposed for efficient
Bayesian inference. The inherent stochastic switching behaviors of spintronic
devices are exploited to build stochastic bitstream generator (SBG) for
stochastic computing with hybrid CMOS/MTJ circuits design. Aiming to improve
the inference efficiency, an SBG sharing strategy is leveraged to reduce the
required SBG array scale by integrating a switch network between SBG array and
stochastic computing logic. A device-to-architecture level framework is
proposed to evaluate the performance of spintronics based Bayesian inference
system (SPINBIS). Experimental results on data fusion applications have shown
that SPINBIS could improve the energy efficiency about 12X than MTJ-based
approach with 45% design area overhead and about 26X than FPGA-based approach.
"
1433,An ultra-low-power sigma-delta neuron circuit,"  Neural processing systems typically represent data using leaky integrate and
fire (LIF) neuron models that generate spikes or pulse trains at a rate
proportional to their input amplitudes. This mechanism requires high firing
rates when encoding time-varying signals, leading to increased power
consumption. Neuromorphic systems that use adaptive LIF neuron models overcome
this problem by encoding signals in the relative timing of their output spikes
rather than their rate. In this paper, we analyze recent adaptive LIF neuron
circuit implementations and highlight the analogies and differences between
them and a first-order sigma-delta feedback loop. We propose a new sigma-delta
neuron circuit that addresses some of the limitations in existing
implementations and present simulation results that quantify the improvements.
We show that the new circuit, implemented in a 1.8 V, 180 nm CMOS process,
offers up to 42 dB signal-to-distortion ratio and consumes orders of magnitude
lower energy. Finally, we also demonstrate how the sigma-delta interpretation
enables mapping of real-valued recurrent neural network to the spiking
framework to emphasize the envisioned application of the proposed circuit.
"
1434,"An Energy-efficient Time-domain Analog VLSI Neural Network Processor
  Based on a Pulse-width Modulation Approach","  A time-domain analog-weighted-sum calculation model based on a pulse-width
modulation (PWM) approach is proposed. The proposed calculation model can be
applied to any types of network structure including multi-layer feedforward
networks. We also propose very large-scale integrated (VLSI) circuits to
implement the proposed model. Unlike the conventional analog voltage or current
mode circuits used in computing-in-memory circuits, our time-domain analog
circuits use transient operation in charging/discharging processes to
capacitors. Since the circuits can be designed without operational amplifiers,
they can be operated with extremely low power consumption. However, they have
to use very high-resistance devices, on the order of giga-ohms. We designed a
CMOS VLSI chip to verify weighted-sum operation based on the proposed model
with binary weights, which realizes the BinaryConnect model. In the chip,
memory cells of static-random-access memory (SRAM) are used for synaptic
connection weights. High-resistance operation was realized by using the
subthreshold operation region of MOS transistors unlike the ordinary
computing-in-memory circuits. The chip was designed and fabricated using a
250-nm fabrication technology. Measurement results showed that energy
efficiency for the weighted-sum calculation was 300~TOPS/W (Tera-Operations Per
Second per Watt), which is more than one order of magnitude higher than that in
state-of-the-art digital AI processors, even though the minimum width of
interconnection used in this chip was several times larger than that in such
digital processors. If state-of-the-art VLSI technology is used to implement
the proposed model, an energy efficiency of more than 1,000~TOPS/W will be
possible. For practical applications, development of emerging analog memory
devices such as ferroelectric-gate field effect transistors (FeFETs) is
necessary.
"
1435,"SMART: Secure Magnetoelectric AntifeRromagnet-Based Tamper-Proof
  Non-Volatile Memory","  The storage industry is moving toward emerging non-volatile memories (NVMs),
including the spin-transfer torque magnetoresistive random-access memory
(STT-MRAM) and the phase-change memory (PCM), owing to their high density and
low-power operation. In this paper, we demonstrate, for the first time, circuit
models and performance benchmarking for the domain wall (DW) reversal-based
magnetoelectric-antiferromagnetic random access memory (ME-AFMRAM) at
cell-level and at array-level. We also provide perspectives for coherent
rotation-based memory switching with topological insulator-driven anomalous
Hall read-out. In the coherent rotation regime, the ultra-low power
magnetoelectric switching coupled with the terahertz-range antiferromagnetic
dynamics result in substantially lower energy-per-bit and latency metrics for
the ME-AFMRAM compared to other NVMs including STTMRAM and PCM. After
characterizing the novel ME-AFMRAM, we leverage its unique properties to build
a dense, on-chip, secure NVM platform, called SMART: A Secure Magnetoelectric
Antiferromagnet- Based Tamper-Proof Non-Volatile Memory. New NVM technologies
open up challenges and opportunities from a data-security perspective. For
example, their sensitivity to magnetic fields and temperature fluctuations, and
their data remanence after power-down make NVMs vulnerable to data theft and
tampering attacks. The proposed SMART memory is not only resilient against data
confidentiality attacks seeking to leak sensitive information but also ensures
data integrity and prevents Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks on the memory. It
is impervious to particular power side-channel (PSC) attacks which exploit
asymmetric read/write signatures for 0 and 1 logic levels, and photonic
side-channel attacks which monitor photo-emission signatures from the chip
backside.

1436,Really Small Shoe Boxes - On Realistic Quantum Resource Estimation,"  Reliable resource estimation and benchmarking of quantum algorithms is a
critical component of the development cycle of viable quantum applications for

1437,"Ultra-low Energy charge trap flash based synapse enabled by parasitic
  leakage mitigation","  Brain-inspired computation promises complex cognitive tasks at biological
energy efficiencies. The brain contains $10^4$ synapses per neuron. Hence,
ultra-low energy, high-density synapses are needed for spiking neural networks
(SNN). In this paper, we use tunneling enabled CTF (Charge Trap Flash) stack
for ultra-low-energy operation (1F); Further, CTF on an SOI platform and
back-to-back connected pn diode and Zener diode (2D) prevent parasitic leakage
to preserve energy advantage in array operation. A bulk $100 {\mu}m $ x $100
{\mu}m$ CTF operation offers tunable, gradual conductance change $({\Delta}G)
i.e. 10^4 $levels, which gives $100$x improvement over literature. SPICE
simulations of 1F2D synapse shows ultra-low energy $(\leqslant 3 fJ/pulse)$ at
180 nm node for long-term potentiation (LTP) and depression (LTD), at 180nm
node for long-term potentiation (LTP) and depression (LTD), which is comparable
to energy estimate in biological synapses (10 fJ). A record low learning rate
(i.e., maximum ${\Delta}G< 1%$ of G-range) is observed - which is tunable.
Excellent reliability ($>10^6 endurance cycles at full conductance swing) is
observed. Such a highly energy efficient synapse with tunable learning rate on
the CMOS platform is a key enabler for the human-brain-scale systems. Keywords:

The proposed architecture consists of refractory, convolution and clustering
layers designed with bio-realistic leaky integrate and fire (LIF) neurons and

DAVIS sensor setup. The performance of the region proposal network has been
compared with event based mean shift algorithm and is found to be far superior
(~50% better) in recall for similar precision (~85%). Computational and memory
complexity of the proposed method are also shown to be similar to that of event
based mean shift

1439,"Ground-state energy estimation of the water molecule on a trapped ion
  quantum computer","  Quantum computing leverages the quantum resources of superposition and
entanglement to efficiently solve computational problems considered intractable
for classical computers. Examples include calculating molecular and nuclear
structure, simulating strongly-interacting electron systems, and modeling
aspects of material function. While substantial theoretical advances have been
made in mapping these problems to quantum algorithms, there remains a large gap
between the resource requirements for solving such problems and the
capabilities of currently available quantum hardware. Bridging this gap will
require a co-design approach, where the expression of algorithms is developed
in conjunction with the hardware itself to optimize execution. Here, we
describe a scalable co-design framework for solving chemistry problems on a
trapped ion quantum computer, and apply it to compute the ground-state energy
of the water molecule. The robust operation of the trapped ion quantum computer
yields energy estimates with errors approaching the chemical accuracy, which is
the target threshold necessary for predicting the rates of chemical reaction
dynamics.
"
1440,"Diffusive Molecular Communications with Reactive Molecules: Channel
  Modeling and Signal Design","  This paper focuses on molecular communication (MC) systems using two types of
signaling molecules which may participate in a reversible bimolecular reaction
in the channel. The motivation for studying these MC systems is that they can
realize the concept of constructive and destructive signal superposition, which
leads to favorable properties such as inter-symbol interference (ISI) reduction
and avoiding environmental contamination due to continuous release of signaling
molecules into the channel. This work first presents a general formulation for
binary modulation schemes that employ two types of signaling molecules and
proposes several modulation schemes as special cases. Moreover, two types of
receivers are considered: a receiver that is able to observe both types of
signaling molecules (2TM), and a simpler receiver that can observe only one
type of signaling molecules (1TM). For both of these receivers, the maximum
likelihood (ML) detector for general binary modulation is derived under the
assumption that the detector has perfect knowledge of the ISI-causing sequence.
In addition, two suboptimal detectors of different complexity are proposed,
namely an ML-based detector that employs an estimate of the ISI-causing
sequence and a detector that neglects the effect of ISI. The proposed
detectors, except for the detector that neglects ISI for the 2TM receiver,
require knowledge of the channel response (CR) of the considered MC system.
Moreover, the CR is needed for performance evaluation of all proposed
detectors. However, deriving the CR of MC systems with reactive signaling
molecules is challenging since the underlying partial differential equations
that describe the reaction-diffusion mechanism are coupled and non-linear.
Therefore, we develop an algorithm for efficient computation of the CR and
validate its accuracy via particle-based simulation.

1441,"AQuRate: MRAM-based Stochastic Oscillator for Adaptive Quantization Rate
  Sampling of Sparse Signals","  Recently, the promising aspects of compressive sensing have inspired new
circuit-level approaches for their efficient realization within the literature.
However, most of these recent advances involving novel sampling techniques have
been proposed without considering hardware and signal constraints.
Additionally, traditional hardware designs for generating non-uniform sampling
clock incur large area overhead and power dissipation. Herein, we propose a
novel non-uniform clock generator called Adaptive Quantization Rate (AQR)
generator using Magnetic Random Access Memory (MRAM)-based stochastic
oscillator devices. Our proposed AQR generator provides ~25-fold reduction in
area, on average, while offering ~6-fold reduced power dissipation, on average,
compared to the state-of-the-art non-uniform clock generators.
"
1442,Clockless Spin-based Look-Up Tables with Wide Read Margin,"  In this paper, we develop a 6-input fracturable non-volatile Clockless LUT
(C-LUT) using spin Hall effect (SHE)-based Magnetic Tunnel Junctions (MTJs) and
provide a detailed comparison between the SHE-MTJ-based C-LUT and Spin Transfer
Torque (STT)-MTJ-based C-LUT. The proposed C-LUT offers an attractive
alternative for implementing combinational logic as well as sequential logic
versus previous spin-based LUT designs in the literature. Foremost, C-LUT
eliminates the sense amplifier typically employed by using a differential
polarity dual MTJ design, as opposed to a static reference resistance MTJ. This
realizes a much wider read margin and the Monte Carlo simulation of the
proposed fracturable C-LUT indicates no read and write errors in the presence
of a variety of process variations scenarios involving MOS transistors as well
as MTJs. Additionally, simulation results indicate that the proposed C-LUT
reduces the standby power dissipation by 5.4-fold compared to the SRAM-based
LUT. Furthermore, the proposed SHE-MTJ-based C-LUT reduces the area by 1.3-fold
and 2-fold compared to the SRAM-based LUT and the STT-MTJ-based C-LUT,
respectively.

1443,A caloritronics-based Mott neuristor,"  Machine learning imitates the basic features of biological neural networks to
efficiently perform tasks such as pattern recognition. This has been mostly
achieved at a software level, and a strong effort is currently being made to
mimic neurons and synapses with hardware components, an approach known as
neuromorphic computing. CMOS-based circuits have been used for this purpose,
but they are non-scalable, limiting the device density and motivating the
search for neuromorphic materials. While recent advances in resistive switching
have provided a path to emulate synapses at the 10 nm scale, a scalable neuron
analogue is yet to be found. Here, we show how heat transfer can be utilized to
mimic neuron functionalities in Mott nanodevices. We use the Joule heating
created by current spikes to trigger the insulator-to-metal transition in a
biased VO2 nanogap. We show that thermal dynamics allow the implementation of
the basic neuron functionalities: activity, leaky integrate-and-fire,
volatility and rate coding. By using local temperature as the internal
variable, we avoid the need of external capacitors, which reduces neuristor
size by several orders of magnitude. This approach could enable neuromorphic
hardware to take full advantage of the rapid advances in memristive synapses,
allowing for much denser and complex neural networks. More generally, we show
that heat dissipation is not always an undesirable effect: it can perform
computing tasks if properly engineered.
"
1444,"On Resistive Memories: One Step Row Readout Technique and Sensing
  Circuitry","  Transistor-based memories are rapidly approaching their maximum density per
unit area. Resistive crossbar arrays enable denser memory due to the small size
of switching devices. However, due to the resistive nature of these memories,
they suffer from current sneak paths complicating the readout procedure. In
this paper, we propose a row readout technique with circuitry that can be used
to read {selector-less} resistive crossbar based memories. High throughput
reading and writing techniques are needed to overcome the memory-wall
bottleneck problem and to enable near memory computing paradigm. The proposed
technique can read the entire row of dense crossbar arrays in one cycle, unlike
previously published techniques. The requirements for the readout circuitry are
discussed and satisfied in the proposed circuit. Additionally, an approximated
expression for the power consumed while reading the array is derived. A figure
of merit is defined and used to compare the proposed approach with existing
reading techniques. Finally, a quantitative analysis of the effect of biasing
mismatch on the array size is discussed.

1445,"Efficient Winograd or Cook-Toom Convolution Kernel Implementation on
  Widely Used Mobile CPUs","  The Winograd or Cook-Toom class of algorithms help to reduce the overall
compute complexity of many modern deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
Although there has been a lot of research done on model and algorithmic
optimization of CNN, little attention has been paid to the efficient
implementation of these algorithms on embedded CPUs, which usually have very
limited memory and low power budget. This paper aims to fill this gap and
focuses on the efficient implementation of Winograd or Cook-Toom based
convolution on modern Arm Cortex-A CPUs, widely used in mobile devices today.
Specifically, we demonstrate a reduction in inference latency by using a set of
optimization strategies that improve the utilization of computational
resources, and by effectively leveraging the ARMv8-A NEON SIMD instruction set.
We evaluated our proposed region-wise multi-channel implementations on Arm
Cortex-A73 platform using several representative CNNs. The results show
significant performance improvements in full network, up to 60%, over existing
im2row/im2col based optimization techniques
"
1446,Streaming Batch Eigenupdates for Hardware Neuromorphic Networks,"  Neuromorphic networks based on nanodevices, such as metal oxide memristors,
phase change memories, and flash memory cells, have generated considerable
interest for their increased energy efficiency and density in comparison to
graphics processing units (GPUs) and central processing units (CPUs). Though
immense acceleration of the training process can be achieved by leveraging the
fact that the time complexity of training does not scale with the network size,
it is limited by the space complexity of stochastic gradient descent, which
grows quadratically. The main objective of this work is to reduce this space
complexity by using low-rank approximations of stochastic gradient descent.
This low spatial complexity combined with streaming methods allows for
significant reductions in memory and compute overhead, opening the doors for
improvements in area, time and energy efficiency of training. We refer to this
algorithm and architecture to implement it as the streaming batch eigenupdate
(SBE) approach.

especially the learning/training algorithm to design a series of brains with
different memristive values to solve complex ill-posed inverse problems based
on a Finite Element(FE) method. First, the neuromorphic computing is addressed
and we focus on a type of memristive circuit computing that falls into the
scope of neuromorphic computing. Secondly based on reference [1] in which the
complex dynamics of the complex memristive circuit was studied, we design a

"
1450,Composable computation in discrete chemical reaction networks,"  We study the composability of discrete chemical reaction networks (CRNs) that
stably compute (i.e., with probability 0 of error) integer-valued functions
$f:\mathbb{N}^d\to\mathbb{N}$. We consider output-oblivious CRNs in which the
output species is never a reactant (input) to any reaction. The class of
output-oblivious CRNs is fundamental, appearing in earlier studies of CRN
computation, because it is precisely the class of CRNs that can be composed by
simply renaming the output of the upstream CRN to match the input of the
downstream CRN.
  Our main theorem precisely characterizes the functions $f$ stably computable
by output-oblivious CRNs with an initial leader. The key necessary condition is
that for sufficiently large inputs, $f$ is the minimum of a finite number of
nondecreasing quilt-affine functions. (An affine function is linear with a
constant offset; a quilt-affine function is linear with a periodic offset).
"
1451,ShiftsReduce: Minimizing Shifts in Racetrack Memory 4.0,"  Racetrack memories (RMs) have significantly evolved since their conception in
2008, making them a serious contender in the field of emerging memory
technologies. Despite key technological advancements, the access latency and
energy consumption of an RM-based system are still highly influenced by the
number of shift operations. These operations are required to move bits to the
right positions in the racetracks. This paper presents data placement
techniques for RMs that maximize the likelihood that consecutive references
access nearby memory locations at runtime thereby minimizing the number of
shifts. We present an integer linear programming (ILP) formulation for optimal
data placement in RMs, and revisit existing offset assignment heuristics,
originally proposed for random-access memories. We introduce a novel heuristic
tailored to a realistic RM and combine it with a genetic search to further
improve the solution. We show a reduction in the number of shifts of up to
52.5%, outperforming the state of the art by up to 16.1%.
"
1452,Polar Coding with Chemical Reaction Networks,"  In this paper, we propose a new polar coding scheme with molecular
programming, which is capable of highly parallel implementation at a nano-scale
without a need of electrical power sources. We designed chemical reaction
networks (CRN) to employ either successive cancellation (SC) or
maximum-likelihood (ML) decoding schemes for short polar codes. From ordinary
differential equation (ODE) analysis of the proposed CRNs, we demonstrate that
SC and ML decoding achieve accurate computations across fully-parallel chemical
reactions. We also make a comparison in terms of the number of required
chemical reactions and species, where the superiority of ML decoder over SC
decoder is observed for very short block lengths.

1453,"Native Chemical Automata and the Thermodynamic Interpretation of Their
  Experimental Accept/Reject Responses","  The theory of computation is based on abstract computing automata which can
be classified into a three-class hierarchy: Finite Automata (FA), Push-down
Automata (PDA) and the Turing Machines (TM). Each class corresponds to
grammar/language classes. The function of the automata consists on recognizing
words in a language generated by some grammar and expressed with letters from
an alphabet. Such automata are, in principle, abstract entities and with
suitable combinations of them we can represent any computation, no matter how
complex. Their physical implementations are possible in any information
carrying and recognition contexts and media, such as electrons in
semiconductors, certain biomolecules in biology or even non-biological
molecules. Here we describe and build non-biochemistry (inorganic chemistry)
examples of a FA, PDA and TM computations carried out by specific laboratory
realizations of the automata. For each of the three realizations we find a
thermodynamic metric, based on enthalpy for the FA and PDA, and on the Gibbs
free energy for the TM, to both assess the results of computation and as a
first step towards quantifying the energetic cost of such computations.
"
1454,A Quantum Router for the Entangled Web,"  Qubit transmission protocols are presently point-to-point, and thus
restrictive in their functionality. A quantum router is necessary for the
quantum Internet to become a reality. We present a quantum router design based
on teleportation, as well as mechanisms for entangled pair management. The
prototype was validated using a quantum simulator.
"
1455,Control Electronics For Semiconductor Spin Qubits,"  Future universal quantum computers solving problems of practical relevance
are expected to require at least $10^6$ qubits, which is a massive scale-up
from the present numbers of less than 50 qubits operated together. Out of the
different types of qubits, solid state qubits are considered to be viable
candidates for this scale-up, but interfacing to and controlling such a large
number of qubits is a complex challenge that has not been solved yet. One
possibility to address this challenge is to use qubit control circuits located
close to the qubits at cryogenic temperatures. In this work we evaluate the
feasibility of this idea, taking as a reference the physical requirements of a
two-electron spin qubit and the specifications of a standard 65 nm
complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) process. Using principles and
flows from electrical systems engineering we provide realistic estimates of the
footprint and of the power consumption of a complete control-circuit
architecture. Our results show that with further research it is possible to
provide scalable electrical control in the vicinity of the qubit, with our
concept.
"
1456,"Geometric Tiles and Powers and Limitations of Geometric Hindrance in
  Self-Assembly","  Tile-based self-assembly systems are capable of universal computation and
algorithmically-directed growth. Systems capable of such behavior typically
make use of ""glue cooperation"" in which the glues on at least $2$ sides of a
tile must match and bind to those exposed on the perimeter of an assembly for
that tile to attach. However, several models have been developed which utilize
""weak cooperation"", where only a single glue needs to bind but other
preventative forces (such as geometric, or steric, hindrance) provide
additional selection for which tiles may attach, and where this allows for
algorithmic behavior. In this paper we first work in a model where tiles are
allowed to have geometric bumps and dents on their edges. We show how such
tiles can simulate systems of square tiles with complex glue functions (using
asymptotically optimal sizes of bumps and dents), and also how they can
simulate weakly cooperative systems in a model which allows for duples (i.e.
tiles either twice as long or twice as tall as square tiles). We then show that
with only weak cooperation via geometric hindrance, no system in any model can
simulate even a class of tightly constrained, deterministic cooperative
systems, further defining the boundary of what is possible using this tool.
"
1457,"Quantum Annealing of Vehicle Routing Problem with Time, State and
  Capacity","  We propose a brand-new formulation of capacitated vehicle routing problem
(CVRP) as quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO). The formulated
CVRP is equipped with time-table which describes time-evolution of each
vehicle. Therefore, various constraints associated with time are successfully
realized. With a similar method, constraints of capacities are also introduced,
where capacitated quantities are allowed to increase and decrease according to
the cities which vehicles arrive. As a bonus of capacity-qubits, one also
obtains a description of state, which allows us to set a variety of traveling
rules, depending on each state of vehicles. As a consistency check, the
proposed QUBO formulation is also evaluated by quantum annealing with D-Wave
2000Q.
"
1458,"Application-level Studies of Cellular Neural Network-based Hardware
  Accelerators","  As cost and performance benefits associated with Moore's Law scaling slow,
researchers are studying alternative architectures (e.g., based on analog
and/or spiking circuits) and/or computational models (e.g., convolutional and
recurrent neural networks) to perform application-level tasks faster, more
energy efficiently, and/or more accurately. We investigate cellular neural
network (CeNN)-based co-processors at the application-level for these metrics.
While it is well-known that CeNNs can be well-suited for spatio-temporal
information processing, few (if any) studies have quantified the
energy/delay/accuracy of a CeNN-friendly algorithm and compared the CeNN-based
approach to the best von Neumann algorithm at the application level. We present
an evaluation framework for such studies. As a case study, a CeNN-friendly
target-tracking algorithm was developed and mapped to an array architecture
developed in conjunction with the algorithm. We compare the energy, delay, and
accuracy of our architecture/algorithm (assuming all overheads) to the most
accurate von Neumann algorithm (Struck). Von Neumann CPU data is measured on an
Intel i5 chip. The CeNN approach is capable of matching the accuracy of Struck,
and can offer approximately 1000x improvements in energy-delay product.
"
1459,"VeriSFQ - A Semi-formal Verification Framework and Benchmark for Single
  Flux Quantum Technology","  In this paper, we propose a semi-formal verification framework for
single-flux quantum (SFQ) circuits called VeriSFQ, using the Universal
Verification Methodology (UVM) standard. The considered SFQ technology is
superconducting digital electronic devices that operate at cryogenic
temperatures with active circuit elements called the Josephson junction, which
operate at high switching speeds and low switching energy - allowing SFQ
circuits to operate at frequencies over 300 gigahertz. Due to key differences
between SFQ and CMOS logic, verification techniques for the former are not as
advanced as the latter. Thus, it is crucial to develop efficient verification
techniques as the complexity of SFQ circuits scales. The VeriSFQ framework
focuses on verifying the key circuit and gate-level properties of SFQ logic:
fanout, gate-level pipeline, path balancing, and input-to-output latency. The
combinational circuits considered in analyzing the performance of VeriSFQ are:
Kogge-Stone adders (KSA), array multipliers, integer dividers, and select
ISCAS'85 combinational benchmark circuits. Methods of introducing bugs into SFQ
circuit designs for verification detection were experimented with - including
stuck-at faults, fanout errors, unbalanced paths, and functional bugs like
incorrect logic gates. In addition, we propose an SFQ verification benchmark
consisting of combinational SFQ circuits that exemplify SFQ logic properties
and present the performance of the VeriSFQ framework on these benchmark
circuits. The portability and reusability of the UVM standard allows the
VeriSFQ framework to serve as a foundation for future SFQ semi-formal
verification techniques.
"
1460,"OIM: Oscillator-based Ising Machines for Solving Combinatorial
  Optimisation Problems","  We present a new way to make Ising machines, i.e., using networks of coupled
self-sustaining nonlinear oscillators. Our scheme is theoretically rooted in a
novel result that establishes that the phase dynamics of coupled oscillator
systems, under the influence of sub-harmonic injection locking, are governed by
a Lyapunov function that is closely related to the Ising Hamiltonian of the
coupling graph. As a result, the dynamics of such oscillator networks evolve
naturally to local minima of the Lyapunov function. Two simple additional steps
(i.e., adding noise, and turning sub-harmonic locking on and off smoothly)
enable the network to find excellent solutions of Ising problems. We
demonstrate our method on Ising versions of the MAX-CUT and graph colouring
problems, showing that it improves on previously published results on several
problems in the G benchmark set. Our scheme, which is amenable to realisation
using many kinds of oscillators from different physical domains, is
particularly well suited for CMOS IC implementation, offering significant
practical advantages over previous techniques for making Ising machines. We
present working hardware prototypes using CMOS electronic oscillators.
"
1461,A novel quantum grid search algorithm and its application,"  In this paper we present a novel quantum algorithm, namely the quantum grid
search algorithm, to solve a special search problem. Suppose $ k $ non-empty
buckets are given, such that each bucket contains some marked and some unmarked
items. In one trial an item is selected from each of the $ k $ buckets. If
every selected item is a marked item, then the search is considered successful.
This search problem can also be formulated as the problem of finding a ""marked
path"" associated with specified bounds on a discrete grid. Our algorithm
essentially uses several Grover search operators in parallel to efficiently
solve such problems. We also present an extension of our algorithm combined
with a binary search algorithm in order to efficiently solve global trajectory
optimization problems. Estimates of the expected run times of the algorithms
are also presented, and it is proved that our proposed algorithms offer
exponential improvement over pure classical search algorithms, while a
traditional Grover's search algorithm offers only a quadratic speedup. We note
that this gain comes at the cost of increased complexity of the quantum
circuitry. The implication of such exponential gains in performance is that
many high dimensional optimization problems, which are intractable for
classical computers, can be efficiently solved by our proposed quantum grid
search algorithm.
"
1462,Two-Way Molecular Communications,"  For nano-scale communications, there must be cooperation and simultaneous
communication between nano devices. To this end, in this paper we investigate
two-way (a.k.a. bi-directional) molecular communications between nano devices.
If different types of molecules are used for the communication links, the
two-way system eliminates the need to consider self-interference. However, in
many systems, it is not feasible to use a different type of molecule for each
communication link. Thus, we propose a two-way molecular communication system
that uses a single type of molecule. We develop a channel model for this system
and use it to analyze the proposed system's bit error rate, throughput, and
self-interference. Moreover, we propose analog- and digital- self-interference
cancellation techniques. The enhancement of link-level performance using these
techniques is confirmed with both numerical and analytical results.
"
1463,Aircraft Loading Optimization: MemComputing the 5th Airbus Problem,"  On the January 22nd 2019, Airbus launched a quantum computing challenge to
solve a set of problems relevant for the aircraft life cycle
(https://www.airbus.com/newsroom/press-releases/en/2019/01/airbus-launches-quantum-computing-challenge-to-transform-the-aircraft-lifecycle.html).
The challenge consists of a set of 5 problems that ranges from design to
deployment of aircraft. This work addresses the 5th problem. The formulation
exploits an Integer programming framework with a linear objective function and
the solution relies on the MemComputing paradigm. It is discussed how to use
MemCPU$^{\text{TM}}$ software to solve efficiently the proposed problem and
assess scaling properties, which turns out to be polynomial for meaningful
solutions of the problem at hand. Also discussed are possible formulations of
the problem utilizing non-linear objective functions, allowing for different
optimization schemes implementable in modified MemCPU software, potentially
useful for field operation purposes.
"
1464,Design and Evaluation of Self-Assembled Actin-Based Nano-Communication,"  The tremendous progress in nanotechnology over the last century, makes it
possible to engineer tiny nanodevices, which they need a nano-communication
network to interact. Two solutions are proposed in literature to create a
nano-communication system, either by using the classical electromagnetic
paradigm with Terahertz band, or using the bio-inspired molecular
communication. However, Terahertz is suffering from molecular absorption and
scattering losses at nano level, and the achievable throughput of molecular
communication is very low. In this paper, we propose a new solution to
establish a wired nano-communication. Self-assembled actin-based is a new
method that takes advantage of actin filaments self-assembly to create a nano
wire between a transmitter and a receiver, and use electrons as information
carriers. VPython framework is used in this paper to perform stochastic
simulations of the nano wire formation. The algorithms used for the simulations
are presented. The stability of the constructed nano wire is analyzed, and the
error probability is calculated. Self-assembled actin-based method promises a
fast and stable nano-communication system with a very high achievable
throughput.
"
1465,"Fast learning synapses with molecular spin valves via selective magnetic
  potentiation","  We studied LSMO/Alq3/AlOx/Co molecular spin valves in view of their use as
synapses in neuromorphic computing. In neuromorphic computing, the learning
ability is embodied in specific changes of the synaptic weight. In this
perspective, the relevant parameter is the conductance of the molecular spin
valve, which plays the role of the synaptic weight. In this work we
demonstrated that the conductance can be changes by the repeated application of
voltage pulses. We studied the parameter space of the pulses in order to
determine the most effective voltage and duration of the pulses. The
conductance could also be modified by aligning the magnetizations of the
ferromagnetic electrodes parallel or anti parallel to each other. This
phenomenon, known as magnetoresistance, affects high conductance devices while
leaving low conductance devices unaffected. We studied how this weight update
rule affected the speed of reward-based learning in an actor-critic framework,
compared to a linear update rule. This nonlinear update performed significantly
better (50 learning trials; Epochs to reach a performance goal of 0.975 was
896+/-301 in the nonlinear case and 1076+/-484 in the nonlinear case; Welch
t-test: p<0.05). The linear update resulted in more learning trails with very
long convergence times, which was largely absent in the nonlinear update.
"
1466,"Addressing Temporal Variations in Qubit Quality Metrics for
  Parameterized Quantum Circuits","  The public access to noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers
facilitated by IBM, Rigetti, D-Wave, etc., has propelled the development of
quantum applications that may offer quantum supremacy in the future large-scale
quantum computers. Parameterized quantum circuits (PQC) have emerged as a major
driver for the development of quantum routines that potentially improve the
circuit's resilience to the noise. PQC's have been applied in both generative
(e.g. generative adversarial network) and discriminative (e.g. quantum
classifier) tasks in the field of quantum machine learning. PQC's have been
also considered to realize high fidelity quantum gates with the available
imperfect native gates of a target quantum hardware. Parameters of a PQC are
determined through an iterative training process for a target noisy quantum
hardware. However, temporal variations in qubit quality metrics affect the
performance of a PQC. Therefore, the circuit that is trained without
considering temporal variations exhibits poor fidelity over time. In this
paper, we present training methodologies for PQC in a completely classical
environment that can improve the fidelity of the trained PQC on a target NISQ
hardware by as much as 42.5%.
"
1467,Digital Memcomputing: from Logic to Dynamics to Topology,"  Digital memcomputing machines (DMMs) are a class of computational machines
designed to solve combinatorial optimization problems. A practical realization
of DMMs can be accomplished via electrical circuits of highly non-linear,
point-dissipative dynamical systems engineered so that periodic orbits and
chaos can be avoided. A given logic problem is first mapped into this type of
dynamical system whose point attractors represent the solutions of the original
problem. A DMM then finds the solution via a succession of elementary
instantons whose role is to eliminate solitonic configurations of logical
inconsistency (""logical defects"") from the circuit. By employing a
supersymmetric theory of dynamics, a DMM can be described by a cohomological
field theory that allows for computation of certain topological matrix elements
on instantons that have the mathematical meaning of intersection numbers on
instantons. We discuss the ""dynamical"" meaning of these matrix elements, and
argue that the number of elementary instantons needed to reach the solution
cannot exceed the number of state variables of DMMs, which in turn can only
grow at most polynomially with the size of the problem. These results shed
further light on the relation between logic, dynamics and topology in digital
memcomputing.
"
1468,"Solving the Steiner Tree Problem in Graphs using Physarum-inspired
  Algorithms","  Some biological experiments show that the tubular structures of Physarum
polycephalum are often analogous to those of Steiner trees. Therefore, the
emerging Physarum-inspired Algorithms (PAs) have the potential of computing
Steiner trees. In this paper, we propose two PAs to solve the Steiner Tree
Problem in Graphs (STPG). We apply some widely-used artificial and real-world
VLSI design instances to evaluate the performance of our PAs. The experimental
results show that: 1) for instances with hundreds of vertices, our first PA can
find feasible solutions with an average error of 0.19%, while the Genetic
Algorithm (GA), the Discrete Particle Swarm Optimization (DPSO) algorithm and a
widely-used Steiner tree approximation algorithm: the Shortest Path Heuristic
(SPH) algorithm can only find feasible solutions with an average error above
4.96%; and 2) for larger instances with up to tens of thousands of vertices,
where our first PA, GA and DPSO are too slow to be used, our second PA can find
feasible solutions with an average error of 3.69%, while SPH can only find
feasible solutions with an average error of 6.42%. These experimental results
indicate that PAs can compute Steiner trees, and it may be preferable to apply
our PAs to solve STPG in some cases.
"
1469,Computing on actin bundles network,"  Actin filaments are conductive to ionic currents, mechanical and voltage
solitons. These travelling localisations can be utilised in making the actin
network executing specific computing circuits. The propagation of localisations
on a single actin filament is experimentally unfeasible, therefore we propose a
`relaxed' version of the computing on actin networks by considering excitation
waves propagating on actin bundles. We show that by using an arbitrary
arrangement of electrodes it is possible to implement two-inputs-one-output
circuits. Frequencies of the Boolean gates' detection in actin network match an
overall distribution of gates discovered in living substrates.
"
1470,Next Steps in Quantum Computing: Computer Science's Role,"  The computing ecosystem has always had deep impacts on society and technology
and profoundly changed our lives in myriads of ways. Despite decades of
impressive Moore's Law performance scaling and other growth in the computing
ecosystem there are nonetheless still important potential applications of
computing that remain out of reach of current or foreseeable conventional
computer systems. Specifically, there are computational applications whose
complexity scales super-linearly, even exponentially, with the size of their
input data such that the computation time or memory requirements for these
problems become intractably large to solve for useful data input sizes. Such
problems can have memory requirements that exceed what can be built on the most
powerful supercomputers, and/or runtimes on the order of tens of years or more.
Quantum computing (QC) is viewed by many as a possible future option for
tackling these high-complexity or seemingly-intractable problems by
complementing classical computing with a fundamentally different compute
paradigm.
  There is a huge gap between the problems for which a quantum computer might
be useful and what we can currently build, program, and run. The goal of the QC
research community is to close the gap such that useful algorithms can be run
in practical amounts of time on reliable real-world QC hardware. In particular,
the goal of this Computing Community Consortium (CCC) workshop was to
articulate the central role that the computer science (CS) research communities
plays in closing this gap. CS researchers bring invaluable expertise in the
design of programming languages, in techniques for systems building,
scalability and verification, and in architectural approaches that can bring
practical QC from the future to the present. This report introduces issues and
recommendations across a range of technical and non-technical topic areas.
"
1471,A practicable guide to the quantum computation architectures,"  The primordial model of quantum computation was introduced over thirty years
ago and the first quantum algorithms have appeared for over twenty years. Yet
the exact architectures for quantum computer seem foreign to an undergraduate
student major in computer science or engineering, even though the mass media
has helped popularize the terminologies in the past decade. Despite being a
cutting-edge technology from both the theoretical and the experimental
perspectives, quantum computation is indeed imminent and it would be helpful to
give the undergraduate students at least a skeleton understanding of what a
quantum computer stands for. Since instruction-set architectures originated
from classical computing models are familiar, we propose analogously a set of
quantum instructions, which can be composed to implement renowned quantum
algorithms. Albeit the similarity one can draw between classical and quantum
computer architectures, current quantum instructions are fundamentally
incommensurable from their classical counterparts because they lack the innate
capability to implement logical deductions and recursions. We discuss this
trait in length and illustrate why it is held responsible that current quantum
computers not be considered general computers.
"
1472,Stochastic Computing with Integrated Optics,"  Stochastic computing (SC) allows reducing hardware complexity and improving
energy efficiency of error resilient applications. However, a main limitation
of the computing paradigm is the low throughput induced by the intrinsic serial
computing of bit-streams. In this paper, we address the implementation of SC in
the optical domain, with the aim to improve the computation speed. We implement
a generic optical architecture allowing the execution of polynomial functions.
We propose design methods to explore the design space in order to optimize key
metrics such as circuit robustness and power consumption. We show that a
circuit implementing a 2 nd order polynomial degree function and operating at
1Ghz leads to 20.1pJ laser consumption per computed bit.
"
1473,"Harnessing Intrinsic Noise in Memristor Hopfield Neural Networks for
  Combinatorial Optimization","  We describe a hybrid analog-digital computing approach to solve important
combinatorial optimization problems that leverages memristors (two-terminal
nonvolatile memories). While previous memristor accelerators have had to
minimize analog noise effects, we show that our optimization solver harnesses
such noise as a computing resource. Here we describe a memristor-Hopfield
Neural Network (mem-HNN) with massively parallel operations performed in a
dense crossbar array. We provide experimental demonstrations solving NP-hard
max-cut problems directly in analog crossbar arrays, and supplement this with
experimentally-grounded simulations to explore scalability with problem size,
providing the success probabilities, time and energy to solution, and
interactions with intrinsic analog noise. Compared to fully digital approaches,
and present-day quantum and optical accelerators, we forecast the mem-HNN to
have over four orders of magnitude higher solution throughput per power
consumption. This suggests substantially improved performance and scalability
compared to current quantum annealing approaches, while operating at room
temperature and taking advantage of existing CMOS technology augmented with
emerging analog non-volatile memristors.

  Framework","  Behavioural phenotyping of Drosophila is an important means in biological and
medical research to identify genetic, pathologic or psychologic impact on
animal behaviour.
"
1475,Network Structure Effects in Reservoir Computers,"  A reservoir computer is a complex nonlinear dynamical system that has been
shown to be useful for solving certain problems, such as prediction of chaotic
signals, speech recognition or control of robotic systems. Typically a
reservoir computer is constructed by connecting a large number of nonlinear
nodes in a network, driving the nodes with an input signal and using the node
outputs to fit a training signal. In this work, we set up reservoirs where the
edges (or connections) between all the network nodes are either +1 or 0, and
proceed to alter the network structure by flipping some of these edges from +1
to -1. We use this simple network because it turns out to be easy to
characterize; we may use the fraction of edges flipped as a measure of how much
we have altered the network. In some cases, the network can be rearranged in a
finite number of ways without changing its structure; these rearrangements are
symmetries of the network, and the number of symmetries is also useful for
characterizing the network. We find that changing the number of edges flipped
in the network changes the rank of the covariance of a matrix consisting of the
time series from the different nodes in the network, and speculate that this
rank is important for understanding the reservoir computer performance.
"
1476,"Spin-Orbit Torque Devices for Hardware Security: From Deterministic to
  Probabilistic Regime","  Protecting intellectual property (IP) has become a serious challenge for chip
designers. Most countermeasures are tailored for CMOS integration and tend to
incur excessive overheads, resulting from additional circuitry or device-level
modifications. On the other hand, power density is a critical concern for
sub-50 nm nodes, necessitating alternate design concepts. Although initially
tailored for error-tolerant applications, imprecise computing has gained
traction as a general-purpose design technique. Emerging devices are currently
being explored to implement ultra-low-power circuits for inexact computing
applications. In this paper, we quantify the security threats of imprecise
computing using emerging devices. More specifically, we leverage the innate
polymorphism and tunable stochastic behavior of spin-orbit torque (SOT)
devices, particularly, the giant spin-Hall effect (GSHE) switch. We enable IP
protection (by means of logic locking and camouflaging) simultaneously for
deterministic and probabilistic computing, directly at the GSHE device level.
We conduct a comprehensive security analysis using state-of-the-art Boolean
satisfiability (SAT) attacks; this study demonstrates the superior resilience
of our GSHE primitive when tailored for deterministic computing. We also
demonstrate how probabilistic computing can thwart most, if not all, existing
SAT attacks. Based on this finding, we propose an attack scheme called
probabilistic SAT (PSAT) which can bypass the defense offered by logic locking
and camouflaging for imprecise computing schemes. Further, we illustrate how
careful application of our GSHE primitive can remain secure even on the
application of the PSAT attack. Finally, we also discuss side-channel attacks
and invasive monitoring, which are arguably even more concerning threats than
SAT attacks.
"
1477,"Multi-contact Phase Change Toggle Logic Device Utilizing Thermal
  Crosstalk","  Phase change memory (PCM) is an emerging high speed, high density, high
endurance, and scalable non-volatile memory technology which utilizes the large
resistivity contrast between the amorphous and crystalline phases of
chalcogenide materials such as Ge2Sb2Te5 (GST). In addition to being used as a
standalone memory, there has been a growing interest in integration of PCM
devices on top of the CMOS layer for computation in memory and neuromorphic
computing. The large CMOS overhead for memory controllers is a limiting factor
for this purpose. Transferring functionality like routing, multiplexing, and
logic to the memory layer can substantially reduce the CMOS overhead, making it
possible to integrate 100s of GB of PCM storage on top of a conventional CPU.
In this work, we present computational analysis of a phase change device
concept that can perform toggle operations. The toggle functionality is
achieved using two physical mechanisms: (i) isolation of different read
contacts due to amorphization between different write contact pairs, and (ii)
thermal cross-talk between a molten region and a previously amorphized region.
Phase-change devices with six contacts can be implemented as toggle flip-flops,
multiplexer, or demultiplexer when interfaced with CMOS transistors. Here, we
demonstrate the operation of the device as a toggle flip-flop with 5
transistors, requiring ~50% of the footprint compared to conventional CMOS
alternatives, with the added advantage of non-volatility.
"
1478,Introduction to UniversalQCompiler,"  We introduce an open source software package UniversalQCompiler written in
Mathematica that allows the decomposition of arbitrary quantum operations into
a sequence of single-qubit rotations (with arbitrary rotation angles) and
controlled-NOT (C-NOT) gates. Together with the existing package QI, this
allows quantum information protocols to be analysed and then compiled to
quantum circuits. Our decompositions are based on Phys. Rev. A 93, 032318
(2016), and hence, for generic operations, they are near optimal in terms of
the number of gates required. UniversalQCompiler allows the compilation of any
isometry (in particular, it can be used for unitaries and state preparation),
quantum channel or positive-operator valued measure (POVM), although the run
time becomes prohibitive for large numbers of qubits. The resulting circuits
can be displayed graphically within Mathematica or exported to LaTeX. We also
provide functionality to translate the circuits to OpenQASM, the quantum
assembly language used, for instance, by the IBM Q Experience.
"
1479,Q# and NWChem: Tools for Scalable Quantum Chemistry on Quantum Computers,"  Fault-tolerant quantum computation promises to solve outstanding problems in
quantum chemistry within the next decade. Realizing this promise requires
scalable tools that allow users to translate descriptions of electronic
structure problems to optimized quantum gate sequences executed on physical
hardware, without requiring specialized quantum computing knowledge. To this
end, we present a quantum chemistry library, under the open-source MIT license,
that implements and enables straightforward use of state-of-art quantum
simulation algorithms. The library is implemented in Q#, a language designed to
express quantum algorithms at scale, and interfaces with NWChem, a leading
electronic structure package. We define a standardized schema for this
interface, Broombridge, that describes second-quantized Hamiltonians, along
with metadata required for effective quantum simulation, such as trial
wavefunction ansatzes. This schema is generated for arbitrary molecules by
NWChem, conveniently accessible, for instance, through Docker containers and a
recently developed web interface EMSL Arrows. We illustrate use of the library
with various examples, including ground- and excited-state calculations for
LiH, H$_{10}$, and C$_{20}$ with an active-space simplification, and
automatically obtain resource estimates for classically intractable examples.
"
1480,"Decomposing Quantum Generalized Toffoli with an Arbitrary Number of
  Ancilla","  We present a general decomposition of the Generalized Toffoli, and for
completeness, the multi-target gate using an arbitrary number of clean or dirty
ancilla. While prior work has shown how to decompose the Generalized Toffoli
using 0, 1, or $O(n)$ many clean ancilla and 0, 1, and $n-2$ dirty ancilla, we
provide a generalized algorithm to bridge the gap, i.e. this work gives an
algorithm to generate a decomposition for any number of clean or dirty ancilla.
While it is hard to guarantee optimality, our decompositions guarantee a
decrease in circuit depth as the number of ancilla increases.
"
1481,Improving Noise Tolerance of Mixed-Signal Neural Networks,"  Mixed-signal hardware accelerators for deep learning achieve orders of
magnitude better power efficiency than their digital counterparts. In the
ultra-low power consumption regime, limited signal precision inherent to analog
computation becomes a challenge. We perform a case study of a 6-layer
convolutional neural network running on a mixed-signal accelerator and evaluate
its sensitivity to hardware specific noise. We apply various methods to improve
noise robustness of the network and demonstrate an effective way to optimize
useful signal ranges through adaptive signal clipping. The resulting model is
robust enough to achieve 80.2% classification accuracy on CIFAR-10 dataset with
just 1.4 mW power budget, while 6 mW budget allows us to achieve 87.1%
accuracy, which is within 1% of the software baseline. For comparison, the
unoptimized version of the same model achieves only 67.7% accuracy at 1.4 mW
and 78.6% at 6 mW.
"
1482,The Search For Leakage-free Entangling Fibonacci Braiding Gates,"  It is an open question if there are leakage-free entangling Fibonacci
braiding gates. We provide evidence to the conjecture for the negative in this
paper. We also found a much simpler protocol to generate approximately
leakage-free entangling Fibonacci braiding gates than existing algorithms in
the literature.
"
1483,Reversible Pebbling Game for Quantum Memory Management,"  Quantum memory management is becoming a pressing problem, especially given
the recent research effort to develop new and more complex quantum algorithms.
The only existing automatic method for quantum states clean-up relies on the
availability of many extra resources. In this work, we propose an automatic
tool for quantum memory management. We show how this problem exactly matches
the reversible pebbling game. Based on that, we develop a SAT-based algorithm
that returns a valid clean-up strategy, taking the limitations of the quantum
hardware into account. The developed tool empowers the designer with the
flexibility required to explore the trade-off between memory resources and
number of operations. We present three show-cases to prove the validity of our
approach. First, we apply the algorithm to straight-line programs, widely used
in cryptographic applications. Second, we perform a comparison with the
existing approach, showing an average improvement of 52.77%. Finally, we show
the advantage of using the tool when synthesizing a quantum circuit on a
constrained near-term quantum device.

1484,Low Power Artificial Neural Network Architecture,"  Recent artificial neural network architectures improve performance and power
dissipation by leveraging resistive devices to store and multiply synaptic
weights with input data. Negative and positive synaptic weights are stored on
the memristors of a reconfigurable crossbar array (MCA). Existing MCA-based
neural network architectures use high power consuming voltage converters or
operational amplifiers to generate the total synaptic current through each
column of the crossbar array. This paper presents a low power MCA-based
feedforward neural network architecture that uses a spintronic device per pair
of columns to generate the synaptic current for each neuron. It is shown
experimentally that the proposed architecture dissipates significantly less
power compared to existing feedforward memristive neural network architectures.

1485,"A Logic Simplification Approach for Very Large Scale Crosstalk Circuit
  Designs","  Crosstalk computing, involving engineered interference between nanoscale
metal lines, offers a fresh perspective to scaling through co-existence with
CMOS. Through capacitive manipulations and innovative circuit style, not only
primitive gates can be implemented, but custom logic cells such as an Adder,
Subtractor can be implemented with huge gains. Our simulations show over 5x
density and 2x power benefits over CMOS custom designs at 16nm [1]. This paper
introduces the Crosstalk circuit style and a key method for large-scale circuit
synthesis utilizing existing EDA tool flow. We propose to manipulate the CMOS
synthesis flow by adding two extra steps: conversion of the gate-level netlist
to Crosstalk implementation friendly netlist through logic simplification and
Crosstalk gate mapping, and the inclusion of custom cell libraries for
automated placement and layout. Our logic simplification approach first
converts Cadence generated structured netlist to Boolean expressions and then
uses the majority synthesis tool to obtain majority functions, which is further
used to simplify functions for Crosstalk friendly implementations. We compare
our approach of logic simplification to that of CMOS and majority logic-based
approaches. Crosstalk circuits share some similarities to majority synthesis
that are typically applied to Quantum Cellular Automata technology. However,
our investigation shows that by closely following Crosstalk's core circuit
styles, most benefits can be achieved. In the best case, our approach shows 36%
density improvements over majority synthesis for MCNC benchmark.

1486,"A high-performance MoS2 synaptic device with floating gate engineering
  for Neuromorphic Computing","  As one of the most important members of the two dimensional chalcogenide
family, molybdenum disulphide (MoS2) has played a fundamental role in the
advancement of low dimensional electronic, optoelectronic and piezoelectric
designs. Here, we demonstrate a new approach to solid state synaptic
transistors using two dimensional MoS2 floating gate memories. By using an
extended floating gate architecture which allows the device to be operated at
near-ideal subthreshold swing of 77 mV/decade over four decades of drain
current, we have realised a charge tunneling based synaptic memory with
performance comparable to the state of the art in neuromorphic designs. The
device successfully demonstrates various features of a biological synapse,
including pulsed potentiation and relaxation of channel conductance, as well as
spike time dependent plasticity (STDP). Our device returns excellent energy
efficiency figures and provides a robust platform based on ultrathin two
dimensional nanosheets for future neuromorphic applications.
"
1487,"Outstanding Bit Error Tolerance of Resistive RAM-Based Binarized Neural
  Networks","  Resistive random access memories (RRAM) are novel nonvolatile memory
technologies, which can be embedded at the core of CMOS, and which could be
ideal for the in-memory implementation of deep neural networks. A particularly
exciting vision is using them for implementing Binarized Neural Networks
(BNNs), a class of deep neural networks with a highly reduced memory footprint.
The challenge of resistive memory, however, is that they are prone to device
variation, which can lead to bit errors. In this work we show that BNNs can
tolerate these bit errors to an outstanding level, through simulations of
networks on the MNIST and CIFAR10 tasks. If a standard BNN is used, up to 10^-4
bit error rate can be tolerated with little impact on recognition performance
on both MNIST and CIFAR10. We then show that by adapting the training procedure
to the fact that the BNN will be operated on error-prone hardware, this
tolerance can be extended to a bit error rate of 4x10^-2. The requirements for
RRAM are therefore a lot less stringent for BNNs than more traditional
applications. We show, based on experimental measurements on a RRAM HfO2
technology, that this result can allow reduce RRAM programming energy by a
factor 30.

1488,Verification Logics for Quantum Programs,"  We survey the landscape of Hoare logics for quantum programs. We review three
papers: ""Reasoning about imperative quantum programs"" by Chadha, Mateus and
Sernadas; ""A logic for formal verification of quantum programs"" by Yoshihiko
Kakutani; and ""Floyd-hoare logic for quantum programs"" by Mingsheng Ying. We
compare the mathematical foundations of the logics, their underlying languages,
and the expressivity of their assertions. We also use the languages to verify
the Deutsch-Jozsa Algorithm, and discuss their relative usability in practice.
"
1489,Study of Decoherence in Quantum Computers: A Circuit-Design Perspective,"  Decoherence of quantum states is a major hurdle towards scalable and reliable
quantum computing. Lower decoherence (i.e., higher fidelity) can alleviate the
error correction overhead and obviate the need for energy-intensive noise
reduction techniques e.g., cryogenic cooling. In this paper, we performed a
noise-induced decoherence analysis of single and multi-qubit quantum gates
using physics-based simulations. The analysis indicates that (i) decoherence
depends on the input state and the gate type. Larger number of $|1\rangle$
states worsen the decoherence; (ii) amplitude damping is more detrimental than
phase damping; (iii) shorter depth implementation of a quantum function can
achieve lower decoherence. Simulations indicate 20\% improvement in the
fidelity of a quantum adder when realized using lower depth topology. The
insights developed in this paper can be exploited by the circuit designer to
choose the right gates and logic implementation to optimize the system-level
fidelity.
"
1490,"Toward convergence of effective field theory simulations on digital
  quantum computers","  We report results for simulating an effective field theory to compute the
binding energy of the deuteron nucleus using a hybrid algorithm on a
trapped-ion quantum computer. Two increasingly complex unitary coupled-cluster
ansaetze have been used to compute the binding energy to within a few percent
for successively more complex Hamiltonians. By increasing the complexity of the
Hamiltonian, allowing more terms in the effective field theory expansion and
calculating their expectation values, we present a benchmark for quantum
computers based on their ability to scalably calculate the effective field
theory with increasing accuracy. Our result of $E_4=-2.220 \pm 0.179$MeV may be
compared with the exact Deuteron ground-state energy $-2.224$MeV. We also
demonstrate an error mitigation technique using Richardson extrapolation on ion
traps for the first time. The error mitigation circuit represents a record for
deepest quantum circuit on a trapped-ion quantum computer.
"
1491,"Quanvolutional Neural Networks: Powering Image Recognition with Quantum
  Circuits","  Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have rapidly risen in popularity for
many machine learning applications, particularly in the field of image
recognition. Much of the benefit generated from these networks comes from their
ability to extract features from the data in a hierarchical manner. These
features are extracted using various transformational layers, notably the
convolutional layer which gives the model its name. In this work, we introduce
a new type of transformational layer called a quantum convolution, or
quanvolutional layer. Quanvolutional layers operate on input data by locally
transforming the data using a number of random quantum circuits, in a way that
is similar to the transformations performed by random convolutional filter
layers. Provided these quantum transformations produce meaningful features for
classification purposes, then the overall algorithm could be quite useful for
near term quantum computing, because it requires small quantum circuits with
little to no error correction. In this work, we empirically evaluated the
potential benefit of these quantum transformations by comparing three types of
models built on the MNIST dataset: CNNs, quantum convolutional neural networks
(QNNs), and CNNs with additional non-linearities introduced. Our results showed
that the QNN models had both higher test set accuracy as well as faster
training compared to the purely classical CNNs.
"
1492,Critical branching processes in digital memcomputing machines,"  Memcomputing is a novel computing paradigm that employs time non-locality
(memory) to solve combinatorial optimization problems. It can be realized in
practice by means of non-linear dynamical systems whose point attractors
represent the solutions of the original problem. It has been previously shown
that during the solution search digital memcomputing machines go through a
transient phase of avalanches (instantons) that promote dynamical long-range
order. By employing mean-field arguments we predict that the distribution of
the avalanche sizes follows a Borel distribution typical of critical branching
processes with exponent $\tau= 3/2$. We corroborate this analysis by solving
various random 3-SAT instances of the Boolean satisfiability problem. The
numerical results indicate a power-law distribution with exponent $\tau = 1.51
\pm 0.02$, in very good agreement with the mean-field analysis. This indicates
that memcomputing machines self-tune to a critical state in which avalanches
are characterized by a branching process, and that this state persists across
the majority of their evolution.
"
1493,Verified Optimization in a Quantum Intermediate Representation,"  We present sqire, a low-level language for quantum computing and
verification. sqire uses a global register of quantum bits, allowing easy
compilation to and from existing `quantum assembly' languages and simplifying
the verification process. We demonstrate the power of sqire as an intermediate
representation of quantum programs by verifying a number of useful
optimizations, and we demonstrate sqire's use as a tool for general
verification by proving several quantum programs correct.
"
1494,On interplay between excitability and geometry,"  A commonly accepted feature of an excitable medium is that a local excitation
leads to a propagation of circular or spiral excitation wave-fronts. This is
indeed the case in fully excitable medium. However, with a decrease of an
excitability localised wave-fragments emerge and propagate ballistically. Using
FitzhHugh-Nagumo model we numerically study how excitation wave-fronts behave
in a geometrically constrained medium and how the wave-fronts explore a random
planar graph. We uncover how excitability controls propagation of excitation in
angled branches, influences arrest of excitation entering a sudden expansion,
and determines patterns of traversing of a random planar graph by an excitation
waves.
"
1495,"New techniques for fault-tolerant decomposition of Multi-Controlled
  Toffoli gate","  Physical implementation of scalable quantum architectures faces an immense
challenge in form of fragile quantum states. To overcome it, quantum
architectures with fault tolerance is desirable. This is achieved currently by
using surface code along with a transversal gate set. This dictates the need
for decomposition of universal Multi Control Toffoli~(MCT) gates using a
transversal gate set. Additionally, the transversal non-Clifford phase gate
incurs high latency which makes it an important factor to consider during
decomposition.Besides, the decomposition of large Multi-control Toffoli~(MCT)
gate without ancilla presents an additional hurdle. In this manuscript, we
address both of these issues by introducing Clifford+$Z_N$ gate library. We
present an ancilla free decomposition of MCT gates with linear phase depth and
quadratic phase count. Furthermore, we provide a technique for decomposition of
MCT gates in unit phase depth using the Clifford+$Z_N$ library, albeit at the
cost of ancillary lines and quadratic phase count.
"
1496,"Processing-In-Memory Acceleration of Convolutional Neural Networks for
  Energy-Efficiency, and Power-Intermittency Resilience","  Herein, a bit-wise Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in-memory accelerator
is implemented using Spin-Orbit Torque Magnetic Random Access Memory (SOT-MRAM)
computational sub-arrays. It utilizes a novel AND-Accumulation method capable
of significantly-reduced energy consumption within convolutional layers and
performs various low bit-width CNN inference operations entirely within MRAM.
Power-intermittence resiliency is also enhanced by retaining the partial state
information needed to maintain computational forward-progress, which is
advantageous for battery-less IoT nodes. Simulation results indicate
$\sim$5.4$\times$ higher energy-efficiency and 9$\times$ speedup over
ReRAM-based acceleration, or roughly $\sim$9.7$\times$ higher energy-efficiency
and 13.5$\times$ speedup over recent CMOS-only approaches, while maintaining
inference accuracy comparable to baseline designs.
"
1497,"Transient dynamics of pulse-driven memristors in the presence of a
  stable fixed point","  Some memristors are quite interesting from the point of view of dynamical
systems. When driven by narrow pulses of alternating polarities, their dynamics
has a stable fixed point, which may be useful for future applications. We study
the transient dynamics of two types of memristors characterized by a stable
fixed point using a time-averaged evolution equation. Time-averaged
trajectories of the Biolek window function memristor and resistor-threshold
type memristor circuit (an effective memristor) are determined analytically,
and the times of relaxation to the stable fixed point are found. Our analytical
results are in perfect agreement with the results of numerical simulations.
"
1498,"Quantum advantage by relational queries about physically realizable
  equivalence classes","  Relational quantum queries are sometimes capable to effectively decide
between collections of mutually exclusive elementary cases without completely
resolving and determining those individual instances. Thereby the set of
mutually exclusive elementary cases is effectively partitioned into equivalence
classes pertinent to the respective query. In the second part of the paper, we
review recent progress in theoretical certifications (relative to the
assumptions made) of quantum value indeterminacy as a means to build quantum
oracles for randomness.
"
1499,"MorphIC: A 65-nm 738k-Synapse/mm$^2$ Quad-Core Binary-Weight Digital
  Neuromorphic Processor with Stochastic Spike-Driven Online Learning","  Recent trends in the field of neural network accelerators investigate weight
quantization as a means to increase the resource- and power-efficiency of
hardware devices. As full on-chip weight storage is necessary to avoid the high
energy cost of off-chip memory accesses, memory reduction requirements for
weight storage pushed toward the use of binary weights, which were demonstrated
to have a limited accuracy reduction on many applications when
quantization-aware training techniques are used. In parallel, spiking neural
network (SNN) architectures are explored to further reduce power when
processing sparse event-based data streams, while on-chip spike-based online
learning appears as a key feature for applications constrained in power and
resources during the training phase. However, designing power- and
area-efficient spiking neural networks still requires the development of
specific techniques in order to leverage on-chip online learning on binary
weights without compromising the synapse density. In this work, we demonstrate
MorphIC, a quad-core binary-weight digital neuromorphic processor embedding a
stochastic version of the spike-driven synaptic plasticity (S-SDSP) learning
rule and a hierarchical routing fabric for large-scale chip interconnection.
The MorphIC SNN processor embeds a total of 2k leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF)
neurons and more than two million plastic synapses for an active silicon area
of 2.86mm$^2$ in 65nm CMOS, achieving a high density of 738k synapses/mm$^2$.
MorphIC demonstrates an order-of-magnitude improvement in the area-accuracy
tradeoff on the MNIST classification task compared to previously-proposed SNNs,
while having no penalty in the energy-accuracy tradeoff.

1500,Secure and secret cooperation of robotic swarms by using Merkle trees,"  Swarm robotics systems are becoming an important component of both academic
research and real-world applications. However, in order to reach widespread
adoption, new models that ensure the secure cooperation of these systems need
to be developed. This work proposes a novel model to encapsulate cooperative
robotic missions in Merkle trees. With the proposed model, swarm operators can
provide the ""blueprint"" of the swarm's mission without disclosing its raw data.
In other words, data verification can be separated from data itself. We propose
a system where robots in the swarm have to ""prove"" their integrity to their
peers by exchanging cryptographic proofs. This work analyzes and tests the
proposed approach for two different robotic missions: foraging (where robots
modify the environment) and maze formation (where robots become part of the
environment). In both missions, robots were able to cooperate and carry out
sequential operations in the correct order without having explicit knowledge
about the mission's high-level goals or objectives. The performance,
communication costs, and information diversity requirements for the proposed
approach are analyzed. Finally, conclusions are drawn and future work
directions are suggested.
"
1501,Energy-Efficient Runtime Adaptable L1 STT-RAM Cache Design,"  Much research has shown that applications have variable runtime cache
requirements. In the context of the increasingly popular Spin-Transfer Torque
RAM (STT-RAM) cache, the retention time, which defines how long the cache can
retain a cache block in the absence of power, is one of the most important
cache requirements that may vary for different applications. In this paper, we
propose a Logically Adaptable Retention Time STT-RAM (LARS) cache that allows
the retention time to be dynamically adapted to applications' runtime
requirements. LARS cache comprises of multiple STT-RAM units with different
retention times, with only one unit being used at a given time. LARS
dynamically determines which STT-RAM unit to use during runtime, based on
executing applications' needs. As an integral part of LARS, we also explore
different algorithms to dynamically determine the best retention time based on
different cache design tradeoffs. Our experiments show that by adapting the
retention time to different applications' requirements, LARS cache can reduce
the average cache energy by 25.31%, compared to prior work, with minimal
overheads.
"
1502,A Parallel Bitstream Generator for Stochastic Computing,"  Stochastic computing (SC) presents high error tolerance and low hardware
cost, and has great potential in applications such as neural networks and image
processing. However, the bitstream generator, which converts a binary number to
bitstreams, occupies a large area and energy consumption, thus weakening the
superiority of SC. In this paper, we propose a novel technique for generating
bitstreams in parallel, which needs only one clock for conversion and
significantly reduces the hardware cost. Synthesis results demonstrate that the
proposed parallel bitstream generator improves 2.5x area and 712x energy
consumption.

prototypes using CMOS electronic oscillators, built on breadboards/perfboards
and PCBs, implementing Ising machines consisting of up to 240 spins with
programmable couplings. We also report that, just by simulating the
differential equations of such Ising machines of larger sizes, good solutions
can be achieved easily on benchmark optimization problems, demonstrating the
effectiveness of oscillator-based Ising machines.
"
1504,"Mean Field Approach for Configuring Population Dynamics on a Biohybrid
  Neuromorphic System","  Real-time coupling of cell cultures to neuromorphic circuits necessitates a
neuromorphic network that replicates biological behaviour both on a per-neuron
and on a population basis, with a network size comparable to the culture. We
present a large neuromorphic system composed of 9 chips, with overall 2880
neurons and 144M conductance-based synapses. As they are realized in a robust
switched-capacitor fashion, individual neurons and synapses can be configured
to replicate with high fidelity a wide range of biologically realistic
behaviour. In contrast to other exploration/heuristics-based approaches, we
employ a theory-guided mesoscopic approach to configure the overall network to
a range of bursting behaviours, thus replicating the statistics of our targeted
in-vitro network. The mesoscopic approach has implications beyond our proposed
biohybrid, as it allows a targeted exploration of the behavioural space, which
is a non-trivial task especially in large, recurrent networks.
"
1505,"Quantum-Inspired Computing: Can it be a Microscopic Computing Model of
  the Brain?","  Quantum computing and the workings of the brain have many aspects in common
and have been attracting increasing attention in academia and industry. The
computation in both is parallel and non-discrete. Though the underlying
physical dynamics (e.g., equation of motion) may be deterministic, the observed
or interpreted outcomes are often probabilistic. Consequently, various
investigations have been undertaken to understand and reproduce the brain on
the basis of quantum physics and computing. However, there have been arguments
on whether the brain can and have to take advantage of quantum phenomena that
need to survive in the macroscopic space-time region at room temperature. This
paper presents a unique microscopic computational model for the brain based on
an ansatz that the brain computes in a manner similar to quantum computing, but
with classical waves. Log-scale encoding of information in the context of
computing with waves is shown to play a critical role in bridging the computing
models with classical and quantum waves. Our quantum-inspired computing model
opens up a possibility of unifying the computing framework of artificial
intelligence and quantum computing beyond quantum machine learning approaches.

1506,"IRC: Cross-layer design exploration of Intermittent Robust Computation
  units for IoTs","  Energy-harvesting-powered computing offers intriguing and vast opportunities
to dramatically transform the landscape of the Internet of Things (IoT) devices
by utilizing ambient sources of energy to achieve battery-free computing. In
order to operate within the restricted energy capacity and intermittency
profile, it is proposed to innovate Intermittent Robust Computation (IRC) Unit
as a new duty-cycle-variable computing approach leveraging the non-volatility
inherent in spin-based switching devices. The foundations of IRC will be
advanced from the device-level upwards, by extending a Spin Hall Effect
Magnetic Tunnel Junction (SHE-MTJ) device. The device will then be used to
realize SHE-MTJ Majority/Polymorphic Gate (MG/PG) logic approaches and
libraries. Then a Logic-Embedded Flip-Flop (LE-FF) is developed to realize
rudimentary Boolean logic functions along with an inherent state-holding
capability within a compact footprint. Finally, the NV-Clustering synthesis
procedure and corresponding tool module are proposed to instantiate the LE-FF
library cells within conventional Register Transfer Language (RTL)
specifications. This selectively clusters together logic and NV state-holding
functionality, based on energy and area minimization criteria. It also realizes
middleware-coherent, intermittent computation without checkpointing,
micro-tasking, or software bloat and energy overheads vital to IoT. Simulation
results for various benchmark circuits including ISCAS-89 validate
functionality and power dissipation, area, and delay benefits.

1507,"Joint Compressed Sensing and Manipulation of Wireless Emissions with
  Intelligent Surfaces","  Programmable, intelligent surfaces can manipulate electromagnetic waves
impinging upon them, producing arbitrarily shaped reflection, refraction and
diffraction, to the benefit of wireless users. Moreover, in their recent form
of HyperSurfaces, they have acquired inter-networking capabilities, enabling
the Internet of Material Properties with immense potential in wireless
communications. However, as with any system with inputs and outputs, accurate
sensing of the impinging wave attributes is imperative for programming
HyperSurfaces to obtain a required response. Related solutions include field
nano-sensors embedded within HyperSurfaces to perform minute measurements over
the area of the HyperSurface, as well as external sensing systems. The present
work proposes a sensing system that can operate without such additional
hardware. The novel scheme programs the HyperSurface to perform compressed
sensing of the impinging wave via simple one-antenna power measurements. The
HyperSurface can jointly be programmed for both wave sensing and wave
manipulation duties at the same time. Evaluation via simulations validates the
concept and highlight its promising potential.

miniaturizing their basic units: synapses and neurons. The challenge for
neurons is to scale them down to submicrometer diameters while maintaining the
properties that allow for reliable information processing: high signal to noise
ratio, endurance, stability, reproducibility. In this work, we show that
compact spin-torque nano-oscillators can naturally implement such neurons, and
quantify their ability to realize an actual cognitive task. In particular, we
show that they can naturally implement reservoir computing with high

years, much less has been done on nanoscale artificial neurons. In this paper,
we show that spintronic nano-oscillators are promising to implement analog
hardware neurons that can be densely interconnected through electromagnetic
signals. We show how spintronic oscillators maps the requirements of artificial
neurons. We then show experimentally how an ensemble of four coupled
oscillators can learn to classify all twelve American vowels, realizing the
most complicated tasks performed by nanoscale neurons.

  Quantum Computing System","  To bridge the gap between limited hardware access and the huge demand for
experiments for Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computing system study,
a simulator which can capture the modeling of both the quantum processor and
its classical control system to realize early-stage evaluation and design space
exploration, is naturally invoked but still missing. This paper presents SANQ,
a Simulation framework for Architecting NISQ computing system. SANQ consists of
two components, 1) an optimized noisy quantum computing (QC) simulator with
flexible error modeling accelerated by eliminating redundant computation, and
2) an architectural simulation infrastructure to construct behavior models for
evaluating the control systems. SANQ is validated with existing NISQ quantum
processor and control systems to ensure simulation accuracy. It can capture the
variance on the QC device and simulate the timing behavior precisely (<1% and
10% error for various real control systems). Several potential applications are
proposed to show that SANQ could benefit the future design of NISQ compiler,
architecture, etc.

1511,"A Multilayer Neural Network Merging Image Preprocessing and Pattern
  Recognition by Integrating Diffusion and Drift Memristors","  With the development of research on novel memristor model and device, neural
networks by integrating various memristor models have become a hot research
topic recently. However, state-of-the-art works still build such neural
networks using drift memristor only. Furthermore, some other related works are
only applied to a few individual applications including pattern recognition and
edge detection. In this paper, a novel kind of multilayer neural network is
proposed, in which diffusion and drift memristor models are applied to
construct a system merging image preprocessing and pattern recognition.
Specifically, the entire network consists of two diffusion memristive cellular
layers for image preprocessing and one drift memristive feedforward layer for
pattern recognition. Experimental results show that good recognition accuracy
of noisy MNIST is obtained due to the fusion of image preprocessing and pattern
recognition. Moreover, owing to high-efficiency in-memory computing and brief
spiking encoding methods, high processing speed, high throughput, and few
hardware resources of the entire network are achieved.
"
1512,Toggle Spin-Orbit Torque MRAM with Perpendicular Magnetic Anisotropy,"  Spin-orbit torque (SOT) is a promising switching mechanism for magnetic
random-access memory (MRAM) as a result of the potential for improved switching
speed and energy-efficiency. It is of particular interest to develop an
SOT-MRAM device with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) in order to
leverage the greater density and thermal stability achievable with PMA as
opposed to in-plane magnetic anisotropy. However, the orthogonality between SOT
and PMA prevents deterministic directional switching without an additional
device component that breaks the symmetry, such as an external magnetic field
or complex physical structure; not only do these components complicate
fabrication, they also are not robust to variations in fabrication and applied
switching current. This letter therefore proposes a simple SOT-MRAM structure
with PMA in which deterministic toggle switching is achieved without requiring
additional device components. Furthermore, this toggle PMA SOT-MRAM is shown to
be far more robust than previous approaches for directional PMA SOT-MRAM, with
greater than 50% tolerance to applied switching current magnitude. This letter
describes the physical structure and toggle switching mechanism, provides
micromagnetic simulations demonstrating its feasibility, and evaluates the
robustness and tolerance to material parameters to guide the fabrication of
optimized devices that will jumpstart the third generation of MRAM.

1513,Matrix Product State Based Quantum Classifier,"  In recent years, interest in expressing the success of neural networks to the
quantum computing has increased significantly. Tensor network theory has become
increasingly popular and widely used to simulate strongly entangled correlated
systems. Matrix product state (MPS) is the well-designed class of tensor
network states, which plays an important role in processing of quantum
information. In this paper, we have shown that matrix product state as
one-dimensional array of tensors can be used to classify classical and quantum
data. We have performed binary classification of classical machine learning
dataset Iris encoded in a quantum state. Further, we have investigated the
performance by considering different parameters on the ibmqx4 quantum computer
and proved that MPS circuits can be used to attain better accuracy. Further,
the learning ability of MPS quantum classifier is tested to classify
evapotranspiration ($ET_{o}$) for Patiala meteorological station located in
Northern Punjab (India), using three years of historical dataset (Agri).
Furthermore, we have used different performance metrics of classification to
measure its capability. Finally, the results are plotted and degree of
correspondence among values of each sample is shown.

1514,Principles of Information Storage in Small-Molecule Mixtures,"  Molecular data systems have the potential to store information at
dramatically higher density than existing electronic media. Some of the first
experimental demonstrations of this idea have used DNA, but nature also uses a
wide diversity of smaller non-polymeric molecules to preserve, process, and
transmit information. In this paper, we present a general framework for
quantifying chemical memory, which is not limited to polymers and extends to
mixtures of molecules of all types. We show that the theoretical limit for
molecular information is two orders of magnitude denser by mass than DNA,
although this comes with different practical constraints on total capacity. We
experimentally demonstrate kilobyte-scale information storage in mixtures of
small synthetic molecules, and we consider some of the new perspectives that
will be necessary to harness the information capacity available from the vast
non-genomic chemical space.

104001 (2014)] L. Chua claims to extend the notion of memristor to all
two-terminal resistive devices that show a hysteresis loop pinched at the
origin. He also states that memcapacitors and meminductors can be defined by a
trivial replacement of symbols in the memristor relations, and, therefore,
there should be a correspondence between the hysteresis curves of different
types of memory elements. This leads the author to the erroneous conclusion
that charge-voltage curves of any memcapacitive devices should be pinched at
the origin. The purpose of this Comment is to correct the wrong statements in
Chua's paper, as well as to highlight some other inconsistencies in his
reasoning. We also provide experimental evidence of a memcapacitive device
showing non-pinched hysteresis.

1516,Design Space Exploration as Quantified Satisfaction,"  We propose novel algorithms for design and design space exploration. The
designs computed by these algorithms are compositions of function types
specified in component libraries. Our algorithms reduce the design problem to
quantified satisfiability and use advanced solvers to find solutions that
represent useful systems.
  The algorithms we present in this paper are sound and complete and are
guaranteed to discover correct designs of optimal size, if they exist. We apply
our method to the design of Boolean systems and discover new and more optimal
classical and quantum circuits for common arithmetic functions such as addition
and multiplication.
  The performance of our algorithms is evaluated through extensive
experimentation. We have first created a benchmark consisting of specifications
of scalable synthetic digital circuits and real-world mirochips. We have then
generated multiple circuits functionally equivalent to the ones in the
benchmark. The quantified satisfiability method shows more than four orders of
magnitude speed-up, compared to a generate and test method that enumerates all
non-isomorphic circuit topologies.
  Our approach generalizes circuit optimization. It uses arbitrary component
libraries and has applications to areas such as digital circuit design,
diagnostics, abductive reasoning, test vector generation, and combinatorial
optimization.

Even though ground breaking advances in several physical implementations like
Quantum-dot Cellular Automata (QCA) or Nanomagnet Logic (NML) have been made in
the last couple of years, design automation for FCN is still in its infancy and
often still relies on manual labor. In this paper, we present an open source
framework called fiction for physical design and technology mapping of FCN
circuits. Its efficient data structures, state-of-the-art algorithms, and
extensibility provide a basis for future research in the community.

1518,"An Interpretable Neural Network for Configuring Programmable Wireless
  Environments","  Software-defined metasurfaces (SDMs) comprise a dense topology of basic
elements called meta-atoms, exerting the highest degree of control over surface
currents among intelligent panel technologies. As such, they can transform
impinging electromagnetic (EM) waves in complex ways, modifying their
direction, power, frequency spectrum, polarity and phase. A well-defined
software interface allows for applying such functionalities to waves and
inter-networking SDMs, while abstracting the underlying physics. A network of
SDMs deployed over objects within an area, such as a floorplan walls, creates
programmable wireless environments (PWEs) with fully customizable propagation
of waves within them. This work studies the use of machine learning for
configuring such environments to the benefit of users within. The methodology
consists of modeling wireless propagation as a custom, interpretable,
back-propagating neural network, with SDM elements as nodes and their
cross-interactions as links. Following a training period the network learns the
propagation basics of SDMs and configures them to facilitate the communication
of users within their vicinity.

1519,"Entanglement, and unsorted database search in noise-based logic","  We explore the collapse of ""wavefunction"" and the measurement of entanglement
in the superpositions of hyperspace vectors in classical physical
instantaneous-noise-based logic (INBL). We find both similarities with and
major differences from the related properties of quantum systems. Two search
algorithms utilizing the observed features are introduced. For the first one we
assume an unsorted names database set up by Alice that is a superposition
(unknown by Bob) of up to n=2^N strings; those we call names. Bob has access to
the superposition wave and to the 2N reference noises of the INBL system of N
noise bits. For Bob, to decide if a given name x is included in the
superposition, once the search has begun, it takes N switching operations
followed by a single measurement of the superposition wave. Thus the time and
hardware complexity of the search algorithm is O[log(n)] which indicates an
exponential speedup compared to Grover's quantum algorithm in a corresponding
setting. An extra advantage is that the error probability of the search is
zero. Moreover, the scheme can also check the existence of a fraction of a
string, or several separate string fractions embedded in an arbitrarily long,
arbitrary string. In the second algorithm, we expand the above scheme to a
phonebook with n names and s phone numbers. When the names and numbers have the
same bit resolution, once the search has begun, the time and hardware
complexity of this search algorithm is O[log(n)]. In the case of one-to-one
correspondence between names and phone numbers (n=s), the algorithm offers
inverse phonebook search too. The error probability of this search algorithm is
also zero.
"
1520,"Convolutional Neural Networks Utilizing Multifunctional Spin-Hall MTJ
  Neurons","  We propose a new network architecture for standard spin-Hall magnetic tunnel
junction-based spintronic neurons that allows them to compute multiple critical
convolutional neural network functionalities simultaneously and in parallel,
saving space and time. An approximation to the Rectified Linear Unit transfer
function and the local pooling function are computed simultaneously with the
convolution operation itself. A proof-of-concept simulation is performed on the
MNIST dataset, achieving up to 98% accuracy at a cost of less than 1 nJ for all
convolution, activation and pooling operations combined. The simulations are
remarkably robust to thermal noise, performing well even with very small
magnetic layers.
"
1521,"Machine Learning Approach for Device-Circuit Co-Optimization of
  Stochastic-Memristive-Device-Based Boltzmann Machine","  A Boltzmann machine whose effective ""temperature"" can be dynamically ""cooled""
provides a stochastic neural network realization of simulated annealing, which
is an important metaheuristic for solving combinatorial or global optimization
problems with broad applications in machine intelligence and operations
research. However, the hardware realization of the Boltzmann stochastic element
with ""cooling"" capability has never been achieved within an individual
semiconductor device. Here we demonstrate a new memristive device concept based
on two-dimensional material heterostructures that enables this critical
stochastic element in a Boltzmann machine. The dynamic cooling effect in
simulated annealing can be emulated in this multi-terminal memristive device
through electrostatic bias with sigmoidal thresholding distributions. We also
show that a machine-learning-based method is efficient for device-circuit
co-design of the Boltzmann machine based on the stochastic memristor devices in
simulated annealing. The experimental demonstrations of the tunable stochastic
memristors combined with the machine-learning-based device-circuit
co-optimization approach for stochastic-memristor-based neural-network circuits
chart a pathway for the efficient hardware realization of stochastic neural
networks with applications in a broad range of electronics and computing
disciplines.

1522,The Language of Biometrics: Analysing Public Perceptions,"  There is an increasing shift in technology towards biometric solutions, but
one of the biggest barriers to widespread use is the acceptance by the users.
In this paper we investigate the understanding, awareness and acceptance of
biometrics by the general public. The primary research method was a survey,
which had 282 respondents, designed to gauge public opinion around biometrics.
Additionally, qualitative data was captured in the form of the participants'
definition of the term \textit{biometrics}. We applied thematic analysis as
well as an automated Word Vector analysis to this data to provide a deeper
insight into the perceptions and understanding of the term. Our results
demonstrate that while there is generally a reasonable level of understanding
of what biometrics are, this is typically limited to the techniques that are
most familiar to participants (e.g., fingerprints or facial recognition). Most
notably individuals' awareness overlooks emerging areas such as behavioural
biometrics (e.g., gait). This was also apparent when we compared participants'
views to definitions provided by official, published sources (e.g., ISO, NIST,
OED, DHS). Overall, this article provides unique insight into the perceptions
and understanding of biometrics as well as areas where users may lack knowledge
on biometric applications.
"
1523,Nonvolatile Memory Cell Based on Memristor Emulator,"  Memristor, one of the fundamental circuit elements, has promising
applications in non-volatile memory and storage technology as it can
theoretically achieve infinite states. Information can be stored independently
in these states and retrieved whenever required. In this paper, we have
proposed a non volatile memory cell based on memristor emulator. The circuit is
able to perform read and write operations. In this memristor based memroy cell,
unipolar pulse is used for writing and bipolar pulse is used for reading.
Unlike other earlier designs, the circuit does not need external read/write
enable switches to switch between read and write operations; the switching is
achieved by the zero average bipolar read pulse given after the completion of
write cycle. In our proposed memristor based memory cell, single bit can be
read and any voltages from 0 to 5 volts can be written. Mathematical analysis
and the simulation results of memristor emulator based read write circuit have
been presented to confirm its operation.
"
1524,Generalized swap networks for near-term quantum computing,"  The practical use of many types of near-term quantum computers requires
accounting for their limited connectivity. One way of overcoming limited
connectivity is to insert swaps in the circuit so that logical operations can
be performed on physically adjacent qubits, which we refer to as solving the
`routing via matchings' problem. We address the routing problem for families of
quantum circuits defined by a hypergraph wherein each hyperedge corresponds to
a potential gate. Our main result is that any unordered set of $k$-qubit gates
on distinct $k$-qubit subsets of $n$ logical qubits can be ordered and
parallelized in $O(n^{k-1})$ depth using a linear arrangement of $n$ physical
qubits; the construction is completely general and achieves optimal scaling in
the case where gates acting on all $\binom{n}{k}$ sets of $k$ qubits are
desired. We highlight two classes of problems for which our method is
particularly useful. First, it applies to sets of mutually commuting gates, as
in the (diagonal) phase separators of Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz
(Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm) circuits. For example, a single
level of a QAOA circuit for Maximum Cut can be implemented in linear depth, and
a single level for $3$-SAT in quadratic depth. Second, it applies to sets of
gates that do not commute but for which compilation efficiency is the dominant
criterion in their ordering. In particular, it can be adapted to Trotterized
time-evolution of fermionic Hamiltonians under the Jordan-Wigner
transformation, and also to non-standard mixers in QAOA. Using our method, a
single Trotter step of the electronic structure Hamiltonian in an arbitrary
basis of $n$ orbitals can be done in $O(n^3)$ depth while a Trotter step of the
unitary coupled cluster singles and doubles method can be implemented in $O(n^2
\eta)$ depth, where $\eta$ is the number of electrons.

1525,"Smartwatch games: Encouraging privacy-protective behaviour in a
  longitudinal study","  While the public claim concern for their privacy, they frequently appear to
overlook it. This disparity between concern and behaviour is known as the
Privacy Paradox. Such issues are particularly prevalent on wearable devices.
These products can store personal data, such as text messages and contact
details. However, owners rarely use protective features. Educational games can
be effective in encouraging changes in behaviour. Therefore, we developed the
first privacy game for (Android) Wear OS watches. 10 participants used
smartwatches for two months, allowing their high-level settings to be
monitored. Five individuals were randomly assigned to our treatment group, and
they played a dynamically-customised privacy-themed game. To minimise
confounding variables, the other five received the same app but lacking the
privacy topic. The treatment group improved their protection, with their usage
of screen locks significantly increasing (p = 0.043). In contrast, 80% of the
control group continued to never restrict their settings. After the posttest
phase, we evaluated behavioural rationale through semi-structured interviews.
Privacy concerns became more nuanced in the treatment group, with opinions
aligning with behaviour. Actions appeared influenced primarily by three
factors: convenience, privacy salience and data sensitivity. This is the first
smartwatch game to encourage privacy-protective behaviour.

1526,Current Mode Neuron for the Memristor based synapse,"  Due to many limitations of Von Neumann architecture such as speed, memory
bandwidth, efficiency of global interconnects and increase in the application
of artificial neural network, researchers have been pushed to look into
alternative architectures such as Neuromorphic computing system. Memristors
(memristive crossbar memory RCM) are used as synapses due to its high packing
density and energy efficiency and CMOS blocks as neurons. The increase in the
terminal resistance of the RCM can degrade its energy efficiency and bandwidth.
A more energy efficient current mode neuron has been proposed in this paper
which can operate at lower voltages as compared to conventional voltage mode
neuron circuit.
"
1527,"Augmenting Cloud Connectivity with Opportunistic Networks for Rural
  Remote Patient Monitoring","  Current remote patient monitoring (RPM) systems are fully reliant on the
Internet. However, complete reliance on Internet connectivity is impractical in
rural and remote environments where modern infrastructure is often lacking,
power outages are frequent, and/or network connectivity is sparse (e.g. rural
communities, mountainous regions of Appalachia, American Indian reservations,
developing countries, and natural disaster situations). This paper proposes
augmenting intermittent Internet with opportunistic communication to leverage
the social behaviors of patients, caregivers, and community members to
facilitate out-of-range monitoring of patients via Bluetooth 5 during
intermittent network connectivity in rural communities. The architecture is
evaluated for Owingsville, KY using U.S. Census Bureau, the National Cancer
Institute's, and IPUMS-ATUS sample data, and is compared against a delay
tolerant RPM case that is completely disconnected from the Internet. The
findings show that with only 0.30 rural adult population participation, the
architecture can deliver 0.95 of non-emergency medical information with an
average delivery latency of approximately 13 hours.
"
1528,"Shape-based Magnetic Domain Wall Drift for an Artificial Spintronic
  Leaky Integrate-and-Fire Neuron","  Spintronic devices based on domain wall (DW) motion through ferromagnetic
nanowire tracks have received great interest as components of neuromorphic
information processing systems. Previous proposals for spintronic artificial
neurons required external stimuli to perform the leaking functionality, one of
the three fundamental functions of a leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron. The
use of this external magnetic field or electrical current stimulus results in
either a decrease in energy efficiency or an increase in fabrication
complexity. In this work, we modify the shape of previously demonstrated
three-terminal magnetic tunnel junction neurons to perform the leaking
operation without any external stimuli. The trapezoidal structure causes
shape-based DW drift, thus intrinsically providing the leaking functionality
with no hardware cost. This LIF neuron therefore promises to advance the
development of spintronic neural network crossbar arrays.

1529,LikeStarter: a Smart-contract based Social DAO for Crowdfunding,"  Crowdfunding has become a popular form of collective funding, in which small
donations or investments, made by groups of people, support the development of
new projects in exchange of free products or different types of recognition.
Social network sites, on the other hand, promote user cooperation and currently
are at the basis of any individuals cyber-interactions. In this paper, we
present LikeStarter, a blockchain-based decentralized platform that combines
social interactions with crowdfunding mechanisms, allowing any user to raise
funds while becoming popular in the social network. Being built over the
Ethereum blockchain, LikeStarter is structured as a Decentralized Autonomous
Organization (DAO), that fosters crowdfunding without the intervention of any
central authority, and recognizes the active role of donors, enabling them to
support artists or projects, while making profits.
"
1530,Blockchain Goes Green? An Analysis of Blockchain on Low-Power Nodes,"  Motivated by the massive energy usage of blockchain, on the one hand, and by
significant performance improvements in low-power, wimpy systems, on the other
hand, we perform an in-depth time-energy analysis of blockchain systems on
low-power nodes in comparison to high-performance nodes. We use three low-power
systems to represent a wide range of the performance-power spectrum, while
covering both x86/64 and ARM architectures. We show that low-end wimpy nodes
are struggling to run full-fledged blockchains mainly due to their small and
low-bandwidth memory. On the other hand, wimpy systems with balanced
performance-to-power ratio achieve reasonable performance while saving
significant amounts of energy. For example, Jetson TX2 nodes achieve around 80%
and 30% of the throughput of Parity and Hyperledger, respectively, while using
18x and 23x less energy compared to traditional brawny servers with Intel Xeon
CPU.

1531,"FlexNGIA: A Flexible Internet Architecture for the Next-Generation
  Tactile Internet","  From virtual reality and telepresence, to augmented reality, holoportation,
and remotely controlled robotics, these future network applications promise an
unprecedented development for society, economics and culture by revolutionizing
the way we live, learn, work and play. In order to deploy such futuristic
applications and to cater to their performance requirements, recent trends
stressed the need for the Tactile Internet, an Internet that, according to the
International Telecommunication Union, combines ultra low latency with
extremely high availability, reliability and security. Unfortunately, today's
Internet falls short when it comes to providing such stringent requirements due
to several fundamental limitations in the design of the current network
architecture and communication protocols. This brings the need to rethink the
network architecture and protocols, and efficiently harness recent
technological advances in terms of virtualization and network softwarization to
design the Tactile Internet of the future.
  In this paper, we start by analyzing the characteristics and requirements of
future networking applications. We then highlight the limitations of the
traditional network architecture and protocols and their inability to cater to
these requirements. Afterward, we put forward a novel network architecture
adapted to the Tactile Internet called FlexNGIA, a Flexible Next-Generation
Internet Architecture. We then describe some use-cases where we discuss the
potential mechanisms and control loops that could be offered by FlexNGIA in
order to ensure the required performance and reliability guarantees for future
applications. Finally, we identify the key research challenges to further
develop FlexNGIA towards a full-fledged architecture for the future Tactile
Internet.
"
1532,"HALLS: An Energy-Efficient Highly Adaptable Last Level STT-RAM Cache for
  Multicore Systems","  Spin-Transfer Torque RAM (STT-RAM) is widely considered a promising
alternative to SRAM in the memory hierarchy due to STT-RAM's non-volatility,
low leakage power, high density, and fast read speed. The STT-RAM's small
feature size is particularly desirable for the last-level cache (LLC), which
typically consumes a large area of silicon die. However, long write latency and
high write energy still remain challenges of implementing STT-RAMs in the CPU
cache. An increasingly popular method for addressing this challenge involves
trading off the non-volatility for reduced write speed and write energy by
relaxing the STT-RAM's data retention time. However, in order to maximize
energy saving potential, the cache configurations, including STT-RAM's
retention time, must be dynamically adapted to executing applications' variable
memory needs. In this paper, we propose a highly adaptable last level STT-RAM
cache (HALLS) that allows the LLC configurations and retention time to be
adapted to applications' runtime execution requirements. We also propose
low-overhead runtime tuning algorithms to dynamically determine the best
(lowest energy) cache configurations and retention times for executing
applications. Compared to prior work, HALLS reduced the average energy
consumption by 60.57% in a quad-core system, while introducing marginal latency
overhead.
"
1533,Actin droplet machine,"  The actin droplet machine is a computer model of a three-dimensional network
of actin bundles developed in a droplet of a physiological solution, which
implements mappings of sets of binary strings. The actin bundle network is
conductive to travelling excitations, i.e. impulses. The machine is interfaced
with an arbitrary selected set of k electrodes through which stimuli, binary
strings of length k represented by impulses generated on the electrodes, are
applied and responses are recorded. The responses are recorded in a form of
impulses and then converted to binary strings. The machine's state is a binary
string of length k: if there is an impulse recorded on the $i$th electrode,
there is a `1' in the i-th position of the string, and `0' otherwise. We
present a design of the machine and analyse its state transition graphs. We
envisage that actin droplet machines could form an elementary processor of
future massive parallel computers made from biopolymers.
"
1534,"Power-optimal, stabilized entangling gate between trapped-ion qubits","  To achieve scalable quantum computing, improving entangling-gate fidelity and
its implementation-efficiency are of utmost importance. We present here a
linear method to construct provably power-optimal entangling gates on an
arbitrary pair of qubits on a trapped-ion quantum computer. This method
leverages simultaneous modulation of amplitude, frequency, and phase of the
beams that illuminate the ions and, unlike the state of the art, does not
require any search in the parameter space. The linear method is extensible,
enabling stabilization against external parameter fluctuations to an arbitrary
order at a cost linear in the order.
"
1535,"Efficient Arbitrary Simultaneously Entangling Gates on a trapped-ion
  quantum computer","  Efficiently entangling pairs of qubits is essential to fully harness the
power of quantum computing. Here, we devise an exact protocol that
simultaneously entangles arbitrary pairs of qubits on a trapped-ion quantum
computer. The protocol requires classical computational resources polynomial in
the system size, and very little overhead in the quantum control compared to a
single-pair case. We demonstrate an exponential improvement in both classical
and quantum resources over the current state of the art. We implement the
protocol on a software-defined trapped-ion quantum computer, where we
reconfigure the quantum computer architecture on demand. Together with the
all-to-all connectivity available in trapped-ion quantum computers, our results
establish that trapped ions are a prime candidate for a scalable quantum
computing platform with minimal quantum latency.

1536,"A Sub-mm$^3$ Ultrasonic Free-floating Implant for Multi-mote Neural
  Recording","  A 0.8 mm$^3$ wireless, ultrasonically powered, free-floating neural recording
implant is presented. The device is comprised only of a 0.25 mm$^2$ recording
IC and a single piezoceramic resonator that is used for both power harvesting
and data transmission. Uplink data transmission is performed by analog
amplitude modulation of the ultrasound echo. Using a 1.78 MHz main carrier, >35
kbps/mote equivalent uplink data rate is achieved. A technique to linearize the
echo amplitude modulation is introduced, resulting in <1.2\% static
nonlinearity of the received signal over a $\pm$10 mV input range. The IC
dissipates 37.7 $\mu$W, while the neural recording front-end consumes 4 $\mu$W
and achieves a noise floor of 5.3 $\mu$V$_{rms}$ in a 5 kHz bandwidth. This
work improves sub-mm recording mote depth by >2.5x, resulting in the highest
measured depth/volume ratio by $\sim$3x. Orthogonal subcarrier modulation
enables simultaneous operation of multiple implants, using a single-element
ultrasound external transducer. Dual-mote simultaneous power up and data
transmission is demonstrated at a rate of 7 kS/s at the depth of 50 mm.
"
1537,"Energy-Efficient Moderate Precision Time-Domain Mixed-signal
  Vector-by-Matrix Multiplier Exploiting 1T-1R Arrays","  The emerging mobile devices in this era of internet-of-things (IoT) require a
dedicated processor to enable computationally intensive applications such as
neuromorphic computing and signal processing. Vector-by-matrix multiplication
(VMM) is the most prominent operation in these applications. Therefore, there
is a critical need for compact and ultralow-power VMM blocks to perform
resource-intensive low-to-moderate precision computations. To this end, in this
work, for the first time, we propose a time-domain mixed-signal VMM exploiting
a modified configuration of 1MOSFET-1RRAM (1T-1R) array. The proposed VMM
overcomes the energy inefficiency of the current-mode VMM approaches based on
RRAMs. A rigorous analysis of the different non-ideal factors affecting the
computational precision indicates that the non-negligible minimum cell
currents, channel length modulation (CLM) and drain-induced barrier lowering
(DIBL) are the dominant mechanisms degrading the precision of the proposed VMM.
Our results also indicate that there exists a trade-off between the
computational precision, dynamic range, and the area- and energy-efficiency of
the proposed VMM approach. Therefore, we provide the necessary design
guidelines for optimizing the performance. Our preliminary results show that an
effective computational precision of 6-bits is achievable owing to an inherent
compensation effect in the modified 1T-1R blocks. Furthermore, a 4-bit 200x200
VMM utilizing the proposed approach exhibits a significantly high energy
efficiency of ~1.5 POps/J and a throughput of 2.5 TOps/s including the
contribution from the input/output (I/O) circuitry.

1538,"Reconfigurable radiofrequency electronic functions designed with 3D
  Smith Charts in Metal-Insulator-Transition Materials","  Recently, the field of Metal-Insulator-Transition (MIT) materials has emerged
as an unconventional solution for novel energy efficient electronic functions,
such as steep slope subthermionic switches, neuromorphic hardware,
reconfigurable radiofrequency functions, new types of sensors, teraherz and
optoelectronic devices. Designing radiofrequency (RF) electronic circuits with
a MIT material like vanadium dioxide, VO2, requires the understanding of its
physics and appropriate models and tools, with predictive capability over large
range of frequency (1-100GHz). Here, we develop 3D Smith charts for devices and
circuits having complex frequency dependences, like the ones resulting by the
use of MIT materials. The novel foundation of a 3D Smith chart involves here
the geometrical fundamental notions of oriented curvature and variable
homothety in order to clarify first theoretical inconsistencies in Foster and
Non Foster circuits, where the driving point impedances exhibit mixed clockwise
and counter-clockwise frequency dependent paths on the Smith chart as frequency
increases. We show here the unique visualization capability of a 3D Smith
chart, which allows to quantify orientation over variable frequency. The new 3D
Smith chart is applied as a 3D multi-parameter modelling and design environment
for the complex case of Metal-Insulator-Transition (MIT) materials where their
permittivity is dependent on the frequency. In this work, we apply 3D Smith
charts to on Vanadium Dioxide (VO2) reconfigurable Peano inductors. We report
fabricated inductors with record quality factors using VO2 phase transition to
program multiple tuning states, operating in the range 4 GHz to 10 GHz.
Finally, we fabricate new Peano curves filters used to extract the
frequency-dependent dielectric constant of VO2 within 1 GHz-50 GHz for the
accurate design of RF electronic applications with phase change materials
"
1539,"Statistical Assertions for Validating Patterns and Finding Bugs in
  Quantum Programs","  In support of the growing interest in quantum computing experimentation,
programmers need new tools to write quantum algorithms as program code.
Compared to debugging classical programs, debugging quantum programs is
difficult because programmers have limited ability to probe the internal states
of quantum programs; those states are difficult to interpret even when
observations exist; and programmers do not yet have guidelines for what to
check for when building quantum programs. In this work, we present quantum
program assertions based on statistical tests on classical observations. These
allow programmers to decide if a quantum program state matches its expected
value in one of classical, superposition, or entangled types of states. We
extend an existing quantum programming language with the ability to specify
quantum assertions, which our tool then checks in a quantum program simulator.
We use these assertions to debug three benchmark quantum programs in factoring,
search, and chemistry. We share what types of bugs are possible, and lay out a
strategy for using quantum programming patterns to place assertions and prevent
bugs.
"
1540,Asymptotic Improvements to Quantum Circuits via Qutrits,"  Quantum computation is traditionally expressed in terms of quantum bits, or
qubits. In this work, we instead consider three-level qu$trits$. Past work with
qutrits has demonstrated only constant factor improvements, owing to the
$\log_2(3)$ binary-to-ternary compression factor. We present a novel technique
using qutrits to achieve a logarithmic depth (runtime) decomposition of the
Generalized Toffoli gate using no ancilla--a significant improvement over
linear depth for the best qubit-only equivalent. Our circuit construction also
features a 70x improvement in two-qudit gate count over the qubit-only
equivalent decomposition. This results in circuit cost reductions for important
algorithms like quantum neurons and Grover search. We develop an open-source
circuit simulator for qutrits, along with realistic near-term noise models
which account for the cost of operating qutrits. Simulation results for these
noise models indicate over 90% mean reliability (fidelity) for our circuit
construction, versus under 30% for the qubit-only baseline. These results
suggest that qutrits offer a promising path towards scaling quantum
computation.
"
1541,Mapping high-performance RNNs to in-memory neuromorphic chips,"  The increasing need for compact and low-power computing solutions for machine
learning applications has triggered significant interest in energy-efficient
neuromorphic systems. However, most of these architectures rely on spiking
neural networks, which typically perform poorly compared to their non-spiking
counterparts in terms of accuracy. In this paper, we propose a new adaptive
spiking neuron model that can be abstracted as a low-pass filter. This
abstraction enables faster and better training of spiking networks using
back-propagation, without simulating spikes. We show that this model
dramatically improves the inference performance of a recurrent neural network
and validate it with three complex spatio-temporal learning tasks: the temporal
addition task, the temporal copying task, and a spoken-phrase recognition task.
We estimate at least 500x higher energy-efficiency using our models on
compatible neuromorphic chips in comparison to Cortex-M4, a popular embedded
microprocessor.

1542,"A Novel General Compact Model Approach for 7nm Technology Node Circuit
  Optimization from Device Perspective and Beyond","  This work presents a novel general compact model for 7nm technology node
devices like FinFETs. As an extension of previous conventional compact model
that based on some less accurate elements including one-dimensional Poisson
equation for three-dimensional devices and analytical equations for short
channel effects, quantum effects and other physical effects, the general
compact model combining few TCAD calibrated compact models with statistical
methods can eliminate the tedious physical derivations. The general compact
model has the advantages of efficient extraction, high accuracy, strong scaling
capability and excellent transfer capability. As a demo application, two key
design knobs of FinFET and their multiple impacts on RC control ESD power clamp
circuit are systematically evaluated with implementation of the newly proposed
general compact model, accounting for device design, circuit performance
optimization and variation control. The performance of ESD power clamp can be
improved extremely. This framework is also suitable for pathfinding researches
on 5nm node gate-all-around devices, like nanowire (NW) FETs, nanosheet (NSH)
FETs and beyond.

1543,"Supervised Learning in Spiking Neural Networks with Phase-Change Memory
  Synapses","  Spiking neural networks (SNN) are artificial computational models that have
been inspired by the brain's ability to naturally encode and process
information in the time domain. The added temporal dimension is believed to
render them more computationally efficient than the conventional artificial
neural networks, though their full computational capabilities are yet to be
explored. Recently, computational memory architectures based on non-volatile
memory crossbar arrays have shown great promise to implement parallel
computations in artificial and spiking neural networks. In this work, we
experimentally demonstrate for the first time, the feasibility to realize
high-performance event-driven in-situ supervised learning systems using
nanoscale and stochastic phase-change synapses. Our SNN is trained to recognize
audio signals of alphabets encoded using spikes in the time domain and to
generate spike trains at precise time instances to represent the pixel
intensities of their corresponding images. Moreover, with a statistical model
capturing the experimental behavior of the devices, we investigate
architectural and systems-level solutions for improving the training and
inference performance of our computational memory-based system. Combining the
computational potential of supervised SNNs with the parallel compute power of
computational memory, the work paves the way for next-generation of efficient
brain-inspired systems.

1544,MetaChem: An Algebraic Framework for Artificial Chemistries,"  We introduce MetaChem, a language for representing and implementing
Artificial Chemistries. We motivate the need for modularisation and
standardisation in representation of artificial chemistries. We describe a
mathematical formalism for Static Graph MetaChem, a static graph based system.
MetaChem supports different levels of description, and has a formal
description; we illustrate these using StringCatChem, a toy artificial
chemistry. We describe two existing Artificial Chemistries -- Jordan Algebra
AChem and Swarm Chemistries -- in MetaChem, and demonstrate how they can be
combined in several different configurations by using a MetaChem environmental

Artificial Chemistries and their tools.

1545,Nonvolatile Spintronic Memory Cells for Neural Networks,"  A new spintronic nonvolatile memory cell analogous to 1T DRAM with
non-destructive read is proposed. The cells can be used as neural computing
units. A dual-circuit neural network architecture is proposed to leverage these
devices against the complex operations involved in convolutional networks.
Simulations based on HSPICE and Matlab were performed to study the performance
of this architecture when classifying images as well as the effect of varying
the size and stability of the nanomagnets. The spintronic cells outperform a
purely charge-based implementation of the same network, consuming about 100 pJ
total per image processed.
"
1546,On Post-Processing the Results of Quantum Optimizers,"  The use of quantum computing for applications involving optimization has been
regarded as one of the areas it may prove to be advantageous (against classical
computation). To further improve the quality of the solutions, post-processing
techniques are often used on the results of quantum optimization. One such
recent approach is the Multi Qubit Correction (MQC) algorithm by Dorband. In
this paper, we will discuss and analyze the strengths and weaknesses of this
technique. Then based on our discussion, we perform an experiment on how
pairing heuristics on the input of MQC can affect the results of a quantum
optimizer and a comparison between MQC and the built-in optimization method
that D-wave Systems offers. Among our results, we are able to show that the
built-in post-processing rarely beats MQC in our tests. We hope that by using
the ideas and insights presented in this paper, researchers and developers will
be able to make a more informed decision on what kind of post-processing
methods to use for their quantum optimization needs.

1547,An overview of memristive cryptography,"  Smaller, smarter and faster edge devices in the Internet of things era
demands secure data analysis and transmission under resource constraints of
hardware architecture. Lightweight cryptography on edge hardware is an emerging
topic that is essential to ensure data security in near-sensor computing
systems such as mobiles, drones, smart cameras, and wearables. In this article,
the current state of memristive cryptography is placed in the context of
lightweight hardware cryptography. The paper provides a brief overview of the
traditional hardware lightweight cryptography and cryptanalysis approaches. The
contrast for memristive cryptography with respect to traditional approaches is
evident through this article, and need to develop a more concrete approach to
developing memristive cryptanalysis to test memristive cryptographic approaches
is highlighted.

1548,"Stochastic Computing for Hardware Implementation of Binarized Neural
  Networks","  Binarized Neural Networks, a recently discovered class of neural networks
with minimal memory requirements and no reliance on multiplication, are a
fantastic opportunity for the realization of compact and energy efficient
inference hardware. However, such neural networks are generally not entirely
binarized: their first layer remains with fixed point input. In this work, we
propose a stochastic computing version of Binarized Neural Networks, where the
input is also binarized. Simulations on the example of the Fashion-MNIST and
CIFAR-10 datasets show that such networks can approach the performance of
conventional Binarized Neural Networks. We evidence that the training procedure
should be adapted for use with stochastic computing. Finally, the ASIC
implementation of our scheme is investigated, in a system that closely
associates logic and memory, implemented by Spin Torque Magnetoresistive Random
Access Memory. This analysis shows that the stochastic computing approach can
allow considerable savings with regards to conventional Binarized Neural
networks in terms of area (62% area reduction on the Fashion-MNIST task). It
can also allow important savings in terms of energy consumption, if we accept
reasonable reduction of accuracy: for example a factor 2.1 can be saved, with
the cost of 1.4% in Fashion-MNIST test accuracy. These results highlight the
high potential of Binarized Neural Networks for hardware implementation, and
that adapting them to hardware constrains can provide important benefits.

1549,Efficient Nano Antenna for Photonic Devices,"  This paper presents the efficient Yagi-Uda nanoantenna with the chain of
directors, reflector and a feed element, where these elements have been
optimized to fulfil the requirement of high directivity and the gain of
antenna. The proposed design consists of six core and cladding with silver core
and silicon cladding is used to achieve high directivity. The design is
analyzed by FIT based CST Software package by which Directivity and Gain of the
antenna are computed. The enhancement of this directivity is mainly contributed
by the increase in the number of directors from the four to five and the
optimized length of the directors which is scaled by 0.9. The simulated results
show that the proposed Yagi antenna provides good performance in terms of
directivity. The suggested antenna design shows the improved directivity of
17.62 at 500 nm wavelength. The proposed design has wide range of applications
including as solar cells.
"
1550,Convolution filter embedded quantum gate autoencoder,"  The autoencoder is one of machine learning algorithms used for feature
extraction by dimension reduction of input data, denoising of images, and prior
learning of neural networks. At the same time, autoencoders using quantum
computers are also being developed. However, current quantum computers have a
limited number of qubits, which makes it difficult to calculate big data. In
this paper, as a solution to this problem, we propose a computation method that
applies a convolution filter, which is one of the methods used in machine
learning, to quantum computation. As a result of applying this method to a
quantum autoencoder, we succeeded in denoising image data of several hundred
qubits or more using only a few qubits under the autoencoding accuracy of 98%,
and the effectiveness of this method was obtained. Meanwhile, we have verified
the feature extraction function of the proposed autoencoder by dimensionality
reduction. By projecting the MNIST data to two-dimension, we found the proposed
method showed superior classification accuracy to the vanilla principle
component analysis (PCA). We also verified the proposed method using IBM Q
Melbourne and the actual machine failed to provide accurate results implying
high error rate prevailing in the current NISQ quantum computer.
"
1551,Bifurcation analysis of a TaO memristor model,"  This paper presents a study of bifurcation in the time-averaged dynamics of
TaO memristors driven by narrow pulses of alternating polarities. The analysis,
based on a physics-inspired model, focuses on the stable fixed points and on
how these are affected by the pulse parameters. Our main finding is the
identification of a driving regime when two stable fixed points exist
simultaneously. To the best of our knowledge, such bistability is identified in
a single memristor for the first time. This result can be readily tested
experimentally, and is expected to be useful in future memristor circuit
designs.
"
1552,In-memory hyperdimensional computing,"  Hyperdimensional computing (HDC) is an emerging computational framework that
takes inspiration from attributes of neuronal circuits such as
hyperdimensionality, fully distributed holographic representation, and
(pseudo)randomness. When employed for machine learning tasks such as learning
and classification, HDC involves manipulation and comparison of large patterns
within memory. Moreover, a key attribute of HDC is its robustness to the
imperfections associated with the computational substrates on which it is
implemented. It is therefore particularly amenable to emerging non-von Neumann
paradigms such as in-memory computing, where the physical attributes of
nanoscale memristive devices are exploited to perform computation in place.
Here, we present a complete in-memory HDC system that achieves a near optimum
trade-off between design complexity and classification accuracy based on three
prototypical HDC related learning tasks, namely, language classification, news
classification, and hand gesture recognition from electromyography signals.
Comparable accuracies to software implementations are demonstrated,
experimentally, using 760,000 phase-change memory devices performing analog
in-memory computing.
"
1553,"Simulation of Programmable Matter Systems Using Active Tile-Based
  Self-Assembly","  Self-assembly refers to the process by which small, simple components mix and
combine to form complex structures using only local interactions. Designed as a
hybrid between tile assembly models and cellular automata, the Tile Automata
(TA) model was recently introduced as a platform to help study connections
between various models of self-assembly. However, in this paper we present a
result in which we use TA to simulate arbitrary systems within the amoebot
model, a theoretical model of programmable matter in which the individual
components are relatively simple state machines that are able to sense the
states of their neighbors and to move via series of expansions and
contractions. We show that for every amoebot system, there is a TA system
capable of simulating the local information transmission built into amoebot
particles, and that the TA ""macrotiles"" used to simulate its particles are
capable of simulating movement (via attachment and detachment operations) while
maintaining the necessary properties of amoebot particle systems. The TA
systems are able to utilize only the local interactions of state changes and
binding and unbinding along tile edges, but are able to fully simulate the
dynamics of these programmable matter systems.

1554,"An Interposer-Based Root of Trust: Seize the Opportunity for Secure
  System-Level Integration of Untrusted Chiplets","  Leveraging 2.5D interposer technology, we advocate the integration of
untrusted commodity components/chiplets with physically separate, entrusted
logic components. Such organization provides a modern root of trust for secure
system-level integration. We showcase our scheme by utilizing industrial ARM
components that are interconnected via a security-providing active interposer,
and thoroughly evaluate the achievable security via different threat scenarios.
Finally, we provide detailed end-to-end physical design results to demonstrate
the efficacy of our proposed methodology.
"
1555,"One Additional Qubit is Enough: Encoded Embeddings for Boolean
  Components in Quantum Circuits","  Research on quantum computing has recently gained significant momentum since
first physical devices became available. Many quantum algorithms make use of
so-called oracles that implement Boolean functions and are queried with highly
superposed input states in order to evaluate the implemented Boolean function
for many different input patterns in parallel. To simplify or enable a
realization of these oracles in quantum logic in the first place, the Boolean
reversible functions to be realized usually need to be broken down into several
non-reversible sub-functions. However, since quantum logic is inherently
reversible, these sub-functions have to be realized in a reversible fashion by
adding further qubits in order to make the output patterns distinguishable (a
process that is also known as embedding). This usually results in a significant
increase of the qubits required in total. In this work, we show how this
overhead can be significantly reduced by utilizing coding. More precisely, we
prove that one additional qubit is always enough to embed any non-reversible
function into a reversible one by using a variable-length encoding of the
output patterns. Moreover, we characterize those functions that do not require
an additional qubit at all. The made observations show that coding often allows
one to undercut the usually considered minimum of additional qubits in
sub-functions of oracles by far.
"
1556,"Stochastic Sparse Learning with Momentum Adaptation for Imprecise
  Memristor Networks","  Memristor based neural networks have great potentials in on-chip neuromorphic
computing systems due to the fast computation and low-energy consumption.
However, the imprecise properties of existing memristor devices generally
result in catastrophic failures for the network in-situ training, which
significantly impedes their engineering applications. In this work, we design a
novel learning scheme that integrates stochastic sparse updating with momentum
adaption (SSM) to efficiently train the imprecise memristor networks with high
classification accuracy. The SSM scheme consists of: (1) a stochastic and
discrete learning method to make weight updates sparse; (2) a momentum based
gradient algorithm to eliminate training noises and distill robust updates; (3)
a network re-initialization method to mitigate the device-to-device variation;
(4) an update compensation strategy to further stabilize the weight programming
process. With the SSM scheme, experiments show that the classification accuracy
on multilayer perceptron (MLP) and convolutional neural network (CNN) improves
from 26.12% to 90.07% and from 65.98% to 92.38%, respectively. Meanwhile, the
total numbers of weight updating pulses decrease 90% and 40% in MLP and CNN,
respectively, and the convergence rates are both 3x faster. The SSM scheme
provides a high-accuracy, low-power, and fast-convergence solution for the
in-situ training of imprecise memristor networks, which is crucial to future
neuromorphic intelligence systems.
"
1557,3D Integration: Another Dimension Toward Hardware Security,"  We review threats and selected schemes concerning hardware security at design
and manufacturing time as well as at runtime. We find that 3D integration can
serve well to enhance the resilience of different hardware security schemes,
but it also requires thoughtful use of the options provided by the umbrella
term of 3D integration. Toward enforcing security at runtime, we envision
secure 2.5D system-level integration of untrusted chips and ""all around""
shielding for 3D ICs.
"
1558,Training large-scale ANNs on simulated resistive crossbar arrays,"  Accelerating training of artificial neural networks (ANN) with analog
resistive crossbar arrays is a promising idea. While the concept has been
verified on very small ANNs and toy data sets (such as MNIST), more
realistically sized ANNs and datasets have not yet been tackled. However, it is
to be expected that device materials and hardware design constraints, such as
noisy computations, finite number of resistive states of the device materials,
saturating weight and activation ranges, and limited precision of
analog-to-digital converters, will cause significant challenges to the
successful training of state-of-the-art ANNs. By using analog hardware aware
ANN training simulations, we here explore a number of simple algorithmic
compensatory measures to cope with analog noise and limited weight and output
ranges and resolutions, that dramatically improve the simulated training
performances on RPU arrays on intermediately to large-scale ANNs.
"
1559,"Accurate deep neural network inference using computational phase-change
  memory","  In-memory computing is a promising non-von Neumann approach for making
energy-efficient deep learning inference hardware. Crossbar arrays of resistive
memory devices can be used to encode the network weights and perform efficient
analog matrix-vector multiplications without intermediate movements of data.
However, due to device variability and noise, the network needs to be trained
in a specific way so that transferring the digitally trained weights to the
analog resistive memory devices will not result in significant loss of
accuracy. Here, we introduce a methodology to train ResNet-type convolutional
neural networks that results in no appreciable accuracy loss when transferring
weights to in-memory computing hardware based on phase-change memory (PCM). We
also propose a compensation technique that exploits the batch normalization
parameters to improve the accuracy retention over time. We achieve a
classification accuracy of 93.7% on the CIFAR-10 dataset and a top-1 accuracy
on the ImageNet benchmark of 71.6% after mapping the trained weights to PCM.
Our hardware results on CIFAR-10 with ResNet-32 demonstrate an accuracy above
93.5% retained over a one day period, where each of the 361,722 synaptic
weights of the network is programmed on just two PCM devices organized in a
differential configuration.
"
1560,"Beamforming Optimization for Wireless Network Aided by Intelligent
  Reflecting Surface with Discrete Phase Shifts","  Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is a cost-effective solution for
achieving high spectrum and energy efficiency in future wireless networks by
leveraging massive low-cost passive elements that are able to reflect the
signals with adjustable phase shifts. Prior works on IRS mainly consider
continuous phase shifts at reflecting elements, which are practically difficult
to implement due to the hardware limitation. In contrast, we study in this
paper an IRS-aided wireless network, where an IRS with only a finite number of
phase shifts at each element is deployed to assist in the communication from a
multi-antenna access point (AP) to multiple single-antenna users. We aim to
minimize the transmit power at the AP by jointly optimizing the continuous
transmit precoding at the AP and the discrete reflect phase shifts at the IRS,
subject to a given set of minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio
(SINR) constraints at the user receivers. The considered problem is shown to be
a mixed-integer non-linear program (MINLP) and thus is difficult to solve in
general. To tackle this problem, we first study the single-user case with one
user assisted by the IRS and propose both optimal and suboptimal algorithms for
solving it. Besides, we analytically show that as compared to the ideal case
with continuous phase shifts, the IRS with discrete phase shifts achieves the
same squared power gain in terms of asymptotically large number of reflecting
elements, while a constant proportional power loss is incurred that depends
only on the number of phase-shift levels. The proposed designs for the
single-user case are also extended to the general setup with multiple users
among which some are aided by the IRS. Simulation results verify our
performance analysis as well as the effectiveness of our proposed designs as
compared to various benchmark schemes.
"
1561,Inter-Tier Process Variation-Aware Monolithic 3D NoC Architectures,"  Monolithic 3D (M3D) technology enables high density integration, performance,
and energy-efficiency by sequentially stacking tiers on top of each other.
M3D-based network-on-chip (NoC) architectures can exploit these benefits by
adopting tier partitioning for intra-router stages. However, conventional
fabrication methods are infeasible for M3D-enabled designs due to temperature
related issues. This has necessitated lower temperature and
temperature-resilient techniques for M3D fabrication, leading to inferior
performance of transistors in the top tier and interconnects in the bottom
tier. The resulting inter-tier process variation leads to performance
degradation of M3D-enabled NoCs. In this work, we demonstrate that without
considering inter-tier process variation, an M3D-enabled NoC architecture
overestimates the energy-delay-product (EDP) on average by 50.8% for a set of
SPLASH-2 and PARSEC benchmarks. As a countermeasure, we adopt a process
variation aware design approach. The proposed design and optimization method
distribute the intra-router stages and inter-router links among the tiers to
mitigate the adverse effects of process variation. Experimental results show
that the NoC architecture under consideration improves the EDP by 27.4% on
average across all benchmarks compared to the process-oblivious design.
"
1562,"Data Conversion in Area-Constrained Applications: the Wireless
  Network-on-Chip Case","  Network-on-Chip (NoC) is currently the paradigm of choice to interconnect the
different components of System-on-Chips (SoCs) or Chip Multiprocessors (CMPs).
As the levels of integration continue to grow, however, current NoCs face
significant scalability limitations and have prompted research in novel
interconnect technologies. Among these, wireless intra-chip communications have
been under intense scrutiny due to their low latency broadcast and
architectural flexibility. Thus far, the practicality of the idea has been
studied from the RF front-end and the network interface perspectives, whereas
little to no attention has been placed on another essential component: the data
converters. This article aims to fill this gap by providing a comprehensive
analysis of the requirements of the scenario, as well as of the current
performance and cost trends of Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs). Based on
Murmann's data, we demonstrate that ADCs will not be a roadblock for the
realization of wireless intra-chip communications although current designs do
not meet their demands fully.
"
1563,Opportunistic Beamforming in Wireless Network-on-Chip,"  Wireless Network-on-Chip (WNoC) has emerged as a promising alternative to
conventional interconnect fabrics at the chip scale. Since WNoCs may imply the
close integration of antennas, one of the salient challenges in this scenario
is the management of coupling and interferences. This paper, instead of
combating coupling, aims to take advantage of close integration to create
arrays within a WNoC. The proposed solution is opportunistic as it attempts to
exploit the existing infrastructure to build a simple reconfigurable
beamforming scheme. Full-wave simulations show that, despite the effects of
lossy silicon and nearby antennas, within-package arrays achieve moderate gains
and beamwidths below 90\textsuperscript{o}, a figure which is already relevant
in the multiprocessor context.
"
1564,Comparative Analysis of Switching Dynamics in Different Memristor Models,"  Memristor, memory resistor, is an emerging technology for computational
memory. Number of different memristor models are available based on the
physical experiments. To use memristor as a computational memory element, one
should know how the internal state modulates in time when driven by current or
voltage. In this paper, we examine three widely used models and make a
comparison of how internal state in these models changes with respect to input
current or voltage. In Strukov model, internal state changes linearly with the
input current. However, the linearity of internal state modulation in Yang
model can be controlled. On the other hand, Pickett model shows non linear
variation in internal state with the input current.

1565,"A Low-Power Domino Logic Architecture for Memristor-Based Neuromorphic
  Computing","  We propose a domino logic architecture for memristor-based neuromorphic
computing. The design uses the delay of memristor RC circuits to represent
synaptic computations and a simple binary neuron activation function.
Synchronization schemes are proposed for communicating information between
neural network layers, and a simple linear power model is developed to estimate
the design's energy efficiency for a particular network size. Results indicate
that the proposed architecture can achieve 0.61 fJ per classification per
component (neurons and synapses) and outperforms other designs in terms of
energy per % accuracy.
"
1566,"Turing complete mechanical processor via automated nonlinear system
  design","  Nanomechanical computers promise a greatly improved energetic efficiency
compared to their electrical counterparts. However, progress towards this goal
is hindered by a lack of modular components, such as logic gates or
transistors, and systematic design strategies. This article describes a
universal logic gate implemented as a nonlinear mass-spring-damper model,
followed by an automated method to translate computations, expressed as source
code of arbitrary complexity, into combinations of this basic building block.
The proposed approach is validated numerically in two steps: First, a set of
discrete models are generated from code. The models implement computations with
increasing complexity, starting by a simple adder and ending in a 8-bit Turing
complete mechanical processor. Then, the models are forward integrated to
demonstrate their computing performance. The processor is validated by
executing the Erathostenes' sieve algorithm to mechanically compute prime
numbers.
"
1567,"Clifford Gate Optimisation and T Gate Scheduling: Using Queueing Models
  for Topological Assemblies","  Clifford gates play a role in the optimisation of Clifford+T circuits.
Reducing the count and the depth of Clifford gates, as well as the optimal
scheduling of T gates, influence the hardware and the time costs of executing
quantum circuits. This work focuses on circuits protected by the surface
quantum error-correcting code. The result of compiling a quantum circuit for
the surface code is called a topological assembly. We use queuing theory to
model a part of the compiled assemblies, evaluate the models, and make the
empiric observation that at least for certain Clifford+T circuits (e.g.
adders), the assembly's execution time does not increase when the available
hardware is restricted. This is an interesting property, because it shows that
T gate scheduling and Clifford gate optimisation have the potential to save
both hardware and execution time.
"
1568,Cellular Memristive-Output Reservoir (CMOR),"  Reservoir computing is a subfield of machine learning in which a complex
system, or 'reservoir,' uses complex internal dynamics to non-linearly project
an input into a higher-dimensional space. A single trainable output layer then
inspects this high-dimensional space for features relevant to perform the given
task, such as a classification. Initially, reservoirs were often constructed
from recurrent neural networks, but reservoirs constructed from many different
elements have been demonstrated. Elementary cellular automata (CA) are one such
system which have recently been demonstrated as a powerful and efficient basis
which can be used to construct a reservoir. To investigate the feasibility and
performance of a monolithic reservoir computing circuit with a fully
integrated, programmable read-out layer, we designed, fabricated, and tested a
full-custom reservoir computing circuit. This design, the cellular
memristive-output reservoir (CMOR), is implemented in 65-nm CMOS technology
with integrated front-end-of-the-line (FEOL) resistive random-access memory
(ReRAM) used to construct a trainable output layer. We detail the design of
this system and present electrical test results verifying its operation and
capability to carry out non-linear classifications.

1569,"An Overview of In-memory Processing with Emerging Non-volatile Memory
  for Data-intensive Applications","  The conventional von Neumann architecture has been revealed as a major
performance and energy bottleneck for rising data-intensive applications. %,
due to the intensive data movements. The decade-old idea of leveraging
in-memory processing to eliminate substantial data movements has returned and
led extensive research activities. The effectiveness of in-memory processing
heavily relies on memory scalability, which cannot be satisfied by traditional
memory technologies. Emerging non-volatile memories (eNVMs) that pose appealing
qualities such as excellent scaling and low energy consumption, on the other
hand, have been heavily investigated and explored for realizing in-memory
processing architecture. In this paper, we summarize the recent research
progress in eNVM-based in-memory processing from various aspects, including the
adopted memory technologies, locations of the in-memory processing in the
system, supported arithmetics, as well as applied applications.
"
1570,Low Probability of Detection Communication: Opportunities and Challenges,"  Low probability of detection (LPD) communication has recently emerged as a
new transmission technology to address privacy and security in wireless
networks. Recent studies have established the fundamental limits of LPD
communication in terms of the amount of information bits that can be conveyed
from a transmitter to a receiver subject to a constraint on a warden's
detection error probability. The established information-theoretic metric
enables analytical studies on the design and performance of LPD communication
under various channel conditions. In this article, we present the key features
of LPD communication and discuss various important design considerations.
Firstly, we clarify the differences between LPD communication and the
well-known physical-layer security. Then, from an information-theoretic point
of view, we discuss the optimal signalling strategies for transmitting the
message-carrying signal and artificial-noise signal for LPD communication.
Finally, we identify the key challenges in the design of practical LPD
communication systems and point out future research directions in this context.
This article provides guidelines for designing practical LPD communication
strategies in wireless systems and networks.

1571,OpenSurgery for Topological Assemblies,"  Surface quantum error-correcting codes are the leading proposal for
fault-tolerance within quantum computers. We present OpenSurgery, a scalable
tool for the preparation of circuits protected by the surface code operated
through lattice surgery. Lattice surgery is considered a resource efficient
method to implement surface code computations. Resource efficiency refers to
the number of physical qubits and the time necessary for executing a quantum
computation. OpenSurgery is a first step towards methods that aid quantum
algorithm design informed by the realities of the hardware architectures.
OpenSurgery can: 1) lay out arbitrary quantum circuits, 2) estimate the quantum

1572,Neuromorphic Liquid Marbles With Aqueous Carbon Nanotube Cores,"  Neuromorphic computing devices attempt to emulate features of biological
nervous systems through mimicking the properties of synapses, towards
implementing the emergent properties of their counterparts, such as learning.
Inspired by recent advances in the utilisation of liquid marbles (microlitre
quantities of fluid coated in hydrophobic powder) for the creation of
unconventional computing devices, we describe the development of liquid marbles
with neuromorphic properties through the use of copper coatings and 1.0 mg/ml
carbon nanotube-containing fluid cores. Experimentation was performed through
sandwiching the marbles between two cup-style electrodes and stimulating them
with repeated DC pulses at 3.0 V. Our results demonstrate that `entrainment' of
a carbon nanotube filled-copper liquid marble via periodic pulses can cause
their electrical resistance to rapidly switch between high to low resistance
profiles, upon inverting the polarity of stimulation: the reduction in
resistance between high and low profiles was approximately 88\% after two
rounds of entrainment. This effect was found to be reversible through reversion
to the original stimulus polarity and was strengthened by repeated
experimentation, as evidenced by a mean reduction in time to switching onset of
43\%. These effects were not replicated in nanotube solutions not bound inside
liquid marbles. Our electrical characterisation also reveals that
nanotube-filled liquid marbles exhibit pinched loop hysteresis IV profiles
consistent with the description of memristors. We conclude by discussing the
applications of this technology to the development of unconventional computing
devices and the study of emergent characteristics in biological neural tissue.
"
1573,"PABO: Pseudo Agent-Based Multi-Objective Bayesian Hyperparameter
  Optimization for Efficient Neural Accelerator Design","  The ever increasing computational cost of Deep Neural Networks (DNN) and the
demand for energy efficient hardware for DNN acceleration has made accuracy and
hardware cost co-optimization for DNNs tremendously important, especially for
edge devices. Owing to the large parameter space and cost of evaluating each
parameter in the search space, manually tuning of DNN hyperparameters is
impractical. Automatic joint DNN and hardware hyperparameter optimization is
indispensable for such problems. Bayesian optimization-based approaches have
shown promising results for hyperparameter optimization of DNNs. However, most
of these techniques have been developed without considering the underlying
hardware, thereby leading to inefficient designs. Further, the few works that
perform joint optimization are not generalizable and mainly focus on CMOS-based
architectures. In this work, we present a novel pseudo agent-based
multi-objective hyperparameter optimization (PABO) for maximizing the DNN
performance while obtaining low hardware cost. Compared to the existing
methods, our work poses a theoretically different approach for joint
optimization of accuracy and hardware cost and focuses on memristive
crossbar-based accelerators. PABO uses a supervisor agent to establish
connections between the posterior Gaussian distribution models of network
accuracy and hardware cost requirements. The agent reduces the mathematical
complexity of the co-optimization problem by removing unnecessary computations
and updates of acquisition functions, thereby achieving significant speed-ups
for the optimization procedure. PABO outputs a Pareto frontier that underscores
the trade-offs between designing high-accuracy and hardware efficiency. Our
results demonstrate a superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art
methods both in terms of accuracy and computational speed (~100x speed up).
"
1574,"A reaction network scheme which implements inference and learning for
  Hidden Markov Models","  With a view towards molecular communication systems and molecular multi-agent
systems, we propose the Chemical Baum-Welch Algorithm, a novel reaction network
scheme that learns parameters for Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). Each reaction in
our scheme changes only one molecule of one species to one molecule of another.
The reverse change is also accessible but via a different set of enzymes, in a
design reminiscent of futile cycles in biochemical pathways. We show that every
fixed point of the Baum-Welch algorithm for HMMs is a fixed point of our
reaction network scheme, and every positive fixed point of our scheme is a
fixed point of the Baum-Welch algorithm. We prove that the ""Expectation"" step
and the ""Maximization"" step of our reaction network separately converge
exponentially fast. We simulate mass-action kinetics for our network on an
example sequence, and show that it learns the same parameters for the HMM as
the Baum-Welch algorithm.

1575,Platform Independent Software Analysis for Near Memory Computing,"  Near-memory Computing (NMC) promises improved performance for the
applications that can exploit the features of emerging memory technologies such
as 3D-stacked memory. However, it is not trivial to find such applications and
specialized tools are needed to identify them. In this paper, we present
PISA-NMC, which extends a state-of-the-art hardware agnostic profiling tool
with metrics concerning memory and parallelism, which are relevant for NMC. The
metrics include memory entropy, spatial locality, data-level, and
basic-block-level parallelism. By profiling a set of representative
applications and correlating the metrics with the application's performance on
a simulated NMC system, we verify the importance of those metrics. Finally, we
demonstrate which metrics are useful in identifying applications suitable for
NMC architectures.
"
1576,"Performance Enhancement of Diffusion-based Molecular Communication with
  Photolysis","  Inter-Symbol Interference (ISI) is the main challenge of bio-inspired
diffusion-based molecular communication. In real biological systems, the
degradation of the remaining molecules from a previous transmission is used to
mitigate ISI. While most prior works have proposed the use of enzymes to
catalyze the molecule degradation, enzymes also degrade the molecules carrying
the information, which drastically decreases the signal strength. In this
paper, we propose the use of photolysis reactions, which use the light to
instantly transform the emitted molecules so they are no longer recognized
after their detection. The light is emitted at an optimal time, allowing the
receiver to detect as many molecules as possible, which increases both the
signal strength and ISI mitigation. A lower bound expression on the expected
number of the observed molecules at the receiver is derived. The bit error
probability expression is also formulated. Both the expected number of observed
molecules and the bit error expressions are validated with simulation results,
which show a visible enhancement when using photolysis reactions. The
performance of the proposed method is evaluated using the
Interference-to-Total-Received molecules metric (ITR) and the derived bit error
probability.

1577,"A Winograd-based Integrated Photonics Accelerator for Convolutional
  Neural Networks","  Neural Networks (NNs) have become the mainstream technology in the artificial
intelligence (AI) renaissance over the past decade. Among different types of
neural networks, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been widely adopted
as they have achieved leading results in many fields such as computer vision
and speech recognition. This success in part is due to the widespread
availability of capable underlying hardware platforms. Applications have always
been a driving factor for design of such hardware architectures. Hardware
specialization can expose us to novel architectural solutions, which can
outperform general purpose computers for tasks at hand. Although different
applications demand for different performance measures, they all share speed
and energy efficiency as high priorities. Meanwhile, photonics processing has
seen a resurgence due to its inherited high speed and low power nature. Here,
we investigate the potential of using photonics in CNNs by proposing a CNN
accelerator design based on Winograd filtering algorithm. Our evaluation
results show that while a photonic accelerator can compete with
current-state-of-the-art electronic platforms in terms of both speed and power,
it has the potential to improve the energy efficiency by up to three orders of
magnitude.

1578,Physics-Informed Echo State Networks for Chaotic Systems Forecasting,"  We propose a physics-informed Echo State Network (ESN) to predict the
evolution of chaotic systems. Compared to conventional ESNs, the
physics-informed ESNs are trained to solve supervised learning tasks while
ensuring that their predictions do not violate physical laws. This is achieved
by introducing an additional loss function during the training of the ESNs,
which penalizes non-physical predictions without the need of any additional
training data. This approach is demonstrated on a chaotic Lorenz system, where
the physics-informed ESNs improve the predictability horizon by about two
Lyapunov times as compared to conventional ESNs. The proposed framework shows
the potential of using machine learning combined with prior physical knowledge
to improve the time-accurate prediction of chaotic dynamical systems.

1579,Optimal Error Correcting Code For Ternary Quantum Systems,"  Multi-valued quantum systems can store more information than binary ones for
a given number of quantum states. For reliable operation of multi-valued
quantum systems, error correction is mandated. In this paper, we propose a
5-qutrit quantum error-correcting code and provide its stabilizer formulation.
Since 5 qutrits are necessary to correct a single error, our proposed code is
optimal in the number of qutrits. We prove that the error model considered in
this paper spans the entire $(3 \times 3)$ operator space. Therefore, our
proposed code can correct any single error on the codeword. This code
outperforms the previous 9-qutrit code in (i) the number of qutrits required
for encoding, (ii) our code can correct any arbitrary $(3 \times 3)$ error,
(ii) our code can readily correct bit errors in a single step as opposed to the
two-step correction used previously, and (iii) phase error correction does not
require correcting individual subspaces.
"
1580,4K-Memristor Analog-Grade Passive Crossbar Circuit,"  The superior density of passive analog-grade memristive crossbars may enable
storing large synaptic weight matrices directly on specialized neuromorphic
chips, thus avoiding costly off-chip communication. To ensure efficient use of
such crossbars in neuromorphic computing circuits, variations of
current-voltage characteristics of crosspoint devices must be substantially
lower than those of memory cells with select transistors. Apparently, this
requirement explains why there were so few demonstrations of neuromorphic
system prototypes using passive crossbars. Here we report a 64x64 passive
metal-oxide memristor crossbar circuit with ~99% device yield, based on a
foundry-compatible fabrication process featuring etch-down patterning and
low-temperature budget, conducive to vertical integration. The achieved ~26%
variations of switching voltages of our devices were sufficient for programming
4K-pixel gray-scale patterns with an average tuning error smaller than 4%. The
analog properties were further verified by experimentally demonstrating MNIST
pattern classification with a fidelity close to the software-modeled limit for
a network of this size, with an ~1% average error of import of
ex-situ-calculated synaptic weights. We believe that our work is a significant
improvement over the state-of-the-art passive crossbar memories in both
complexity and analog properties.
"
1581,"Composable Rate-Independent Computation in Continuous Chemical Reaction
  Networks","  Biological regulatory networks depend upon chemical interactions to process
information. Engineering such molecular computing systems is a major challenge
for synthetic biology and related fields. The chemical reaction network (CRN)
model idealizes chemical interactions, allowing rigorous reasoning about the
computational power of chemical kinetics. Here we focus on function computation
with CRNs, where we think of the initial concentrations of some species as the
input and the equilibrium concentration of another species as the output.
Specifically, we are concerned with CRNs that are rate-independent (the
computation must be correct independent of the reaction rate law) and
composable ($f\circ g$ can be computed by concatenating the CRNs computing $f$
and $g$). Rate independence and composability are important engineering
desiderata, permitting implementations that violate mass-action kinetics, or
even ""well-mixedness"", and allowing the systematic construction of complex
computation via modular design. We show that to construct composable
rate-independent CRNs, it is necessary and sufficient to ensure that the output
species of a module is not a reactant in any reaction within the module. We
then exactly characterize the functions computable by such CRNs as
superadditive, positive-continuous, and piecewise rational linear. Thus
composability severely limits rate-independent computation unless more
sophisticated input/output encodings are used.
"
1582,"X-CHANGR: Changing Memristive Crossbar Mapping for Mitigating
  Line-Resistance Induced Accuracy Degradation in Deep Neural Networks","  There is widespread interest in emerging technologies, especially resistive
crossbars for accelerating Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). Resistive crossbars
offer a highly-parallel and efficient matrix-vector-multiplication (MVM)
operation. MVM being the most dominant operation in DNNs makes crossbars
ideally suited. However, various sources of device and circuit non-idealities
lead to errors in the MVM output, thereby reducing DNN accuracy. Towards that
end, we propose crossbar re-mapping strategies to mitigate line-resistance
induced accuracy degradation in DNNs, without having to re-train the learned
weights, unlike most prior works. Line-resistances degrade the voltage levels
along the crossbar columns, thereby inducing more errors at the columns away
from the drivers. We rank the DNN weights and kernels based on a sensitivity
analysis, and re-arrange the columns such that the most sensitive kernels are
mapped closer to the drivers, thereby minimizing the impact of errors on the
overall accuracy. We propose two algorithms $-$ static remapping strategy (SRS)
and dynamic remapping strategy (DRS), to optimize the crossbar re-arrangement
of a pre-trained DNN. We demonstrate the benefits of our approach on a standard
VGG16 network trained using CIFAR10 dataset. Our results show that SRS and DRS
limit the accuracy degradation to 2.9\% and 2.1\%, respectively, compared to a
5.6\% drop from an as it is mapping of weights and kernels to crossbars. We
believe this work brings an additional aspect for optimization, which can be
used in tandem with existing mitigation techniques, such as in-situ
compensation, technology aware training and re-training approaches, to enhance
system performance.

1583,"Towards Wireless Health Monitoring via Analog Signal Compression based
  Biosensing Platform","  Wireless all-analog biosensor design for concurrent microfluidic and
physiological signal monitoring is presented in this work. The key component is
an all-analog circuit capable of compressing two analog sources into one analog
signal by Analog Joint Source-Channel Coding (AJSCC). Two circuit designs are
discussed, including the stacked-Voltage Controlled Voltage Source (VCVS)
design with the fixed number of levels, and an improved design, which supports
a flexible number of AJSCC levels. Experimental results are presented on the
wireless biosensor prototype, composed of Printed Circuit Board (PCB)
realizations of the stacked-VCVS design. Furthermore, circuit simulation and
wireless link simulation results are presented on the improved design. Results
indicate that the proposed wireless biosensor is well suited for sensing two
biological signals simultaneously with high accuracy, and can be applied to a
wide variety of low-power and low-cost wireless continuous health monitoring
applications.
"
1584,"A Formal Approach for Efficient Navigation Management of Hybrid Electric
  Vehicles on Long Trips","  Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) are gaining popularity due to their
economic efficiency as well as their contribution to green management. PHEVs
allow the driver to use electric power exclusively for driving and then switch
to gasoline as needed. The more gasoline a vehicle uses, the higher cost is
required for the trip. However, a PHEV cannot last for a long period on stored
electricity without being recharged. Thus, it needs frequent recharging
compared to traditional gasoline-powered vehicles. Moreover, the battery
recharging time is usually long, which leads to longer delays on a trip.
Therefore, it is necessary to provide a flexible navigation management scheme
along with an efficient recharging schedule, which allows the driver to choose
an optimal route based on the fuel-cost and time-to-destination constraints. In
this paper, we present a formal model to solve this PHEV navigation management
problem. The model is solved to provide a driver with a comprehensive routing
plan including the potential recharging and refueling points that satisfy the
given requirements, particularly the maximum fuel cost and the maximum trip
time. In addition, we propose a price-based navigation control technique to
achieve better load balance for the traffic system. Evaluation results show
that the proposed formal models can be solved efficiently even with large road
networks.

1585,"Optical Reservoir Computing using multiple light scattering for chaotic
  systems prediction","  Reservoir Computing is a relatively recent computational framework based on a
large Recurrent Neural Network with fixed weights. Many physical
implementations of Reservoir Computing have been proposed to improve speed and
energy efficiency. In this study, we report new advances in Optical Reservoir
Computing using multiple light scattering to accelerate the recursive
computation of the reservoir states. Two different spatial light modulation
technologies, namely, phase or binary amplitude modulations, are compared.
Phase modulation is a promising direction already employed in other photonic
implementations of Reservoir Computing. Additionally, we report a
Digital-Micromirror-based Reservoir Computing at up to 640 Hz, more than double
the previously reported frequency using a remotely controlled optical device
developed by LightOn, and present new binarization strategies to improve the
performance of binarized Reservoir Computing.

1586,"Information Flow Theory (IFT) of Biologic and Machine Consciousness:
  Implications for Artificial General Intelligence and the Technological
  Singularity","  The subjective experience of consciousness is at once familiar and yet deeply
mysterious. Strategies exploring the top-down mechanisms of conscious thought
within the human brain have been unable to produce a generalized explanatory
theory that scales through evolution and can be applied to artificial systems.
Information Flow Theory (IFT) provides a novel framework for understanding both
the development and nature of consciousness in any system capable of processing
information. In prioritizing the direction of information flow over information
computation, IFT produces a range of unexpected predictions. The purpose of
this manuscript is to introduce the basic concepts of IFT and explore the
manifold implications regarding artificial intelligence, superhuman
consciousness, and our basic perception of reality.
"
1587,Magnetic skyrmion artificial synapse for neuromorphic computing,"  Since the experimental discovery of magnetic skyrmions achieved one decade
ago, there have been significant efforts to bring the virtual particles into
all-electrical fully functional devices, inspired by their fascinating physical
and topological properties suitable for future low-power electronics. Here, we
experimentally demonstrate such a device: electrically-operating skyrmion-based
artificial synaptic device designed for neuromorphic computing. We present that
controlled current-induced creation, motion, detection and deletion of
skyrmions in ferrimagnetic multilayers can be harnessed in a single device at
room temperature to imitate the behaviors of biological synapses. Using
simulations, we demonstrate that such skyrmion-based synapses could be used to
perform neuromorphic pattern-recognition computing using handwritten
recognition data set, reaching to the accuracy of ~89 percents, comparable to
the software-based training accuracy of ~94 percents. Chip-level simulation
then highlights the potential of skyrmion synapse compared to existing
technologies. Our findings experimentally illustrate the basic concepts of
skyrmion-based fully functional electronic devices while providing a new
building block in the emerging field of spintronics-based bio-inspired
computing.
"
1588,"Energy-efficient Wireless Analog Sensing for Persistent Underwater
  Environmental Monitoring","  The design of sensors or ""things"" as part of the new Internet of Underwater
Things (IoUTs) paradigm comes with multiple challenges including limited
battery capacity, not polluting the water body, and the ability to track
continuously phenomena with high temporal/spatial variability. We claim that
traditional digital sensors are incapable to meet these demands because of
their high power consumption, high complexity (cost), and the use of
non-biodegradable materials. To address the above challenges, we propose a
novel architecture consisting of a sensing substrate of dense analog
biodegradable sensors over which lies the traditional Wireless Sensor Network
(WSN). The substrate analog biodegradable sensors perform Shannon mapping (a
data-compression technique) using just a single Field Effect Transistor (FET)
without the need for power-hungry Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs) resulting
in much lower power consumption, complexity, and the ability to be powered
using only sustainable energy-harvesting techniques. A novel and efficient
decoding technique is also presented. Both encoding/decoding techniques have
been verified via Spice and MATLAB simulations accounting for underwater
acoustic channel variations.
"
1589,Evolution of Technologies and Multivalued Circuits,"  For more than 45 years, many multi-valued circuits have been presented. With
very rare exceptions, they have been unsuccessful for fundamental reasons that
can be explained. Each time a new circuit technology is presented, a lot of new
MVL circuits are proposed. Can new circuit technologies overcome the
fundamental disadvantages of MVL circuits? The evolution of IC technologies in
the last decades unfortunately increases the disadvantage of MVL circuits
versus binary ones. For non conventional technologies, only quantum devices
look promising, even if implementation is challenging and applications are
restricted to a small niche.
"
1590,"Don't take it lightly: Phasing optical random projections with unknown
  operators","  In this paper we tackle the problem of recovering the phase of complex linear
measurements when only magnitude information is available and we control the
input. We are motivated by the recent development of dedicated optics-based
hardware for rapid random projections which leverages the propagation of light
in random media. A signal of interest $\mathbf{\xi} \in \mathbb{R}^N$ is mixed
by a random scattering medium to compute the projection $\mathbf{y} =
\mathbf{A} \mathbf{\xi}$, with $\mathbf{A} \in \mathbb{C}^{M \times N}$ being a
realization of a standard complex Gaussian iid random matrix. Such optics-based
matrix multiplications can be much faster and energy-efficient than their CPU
or GPU counterparts, yet two difficulties must be resolved: only the intensity
${|\mathbf{y}|}^2$ can be recorded by the camera, and the transmission matrix
$\mathbf{A}$ is unknown. We show that even without knowing $\mathbf{A}$, we can
recover the unknown phase of $\mathbf{y}$ for some equivalent transmission
matrix with the same distribution as $\mathbf{A}$. Our method is based on two
observations: first, conjugating or changing the phase of any row of
$\mathbf{A}$ does not change its distribution; and second, since we control the
input we can interfere $\mathbf{\xi}$ with arbitrary reference signals. We show
how to leverage these observations to cast the measurement phase retrieval
problem as a Euclidean distance geometry problem. We demonstrate appealing
properties of the proposed algorithm in both numerical simulations and real
hardware experiments. Not only does our algorithm accurately recover the
missing phase, but it mitigates the effects of quantization and the sensitivity
threshold, thus improving the measured magnitudes.
"
1591,A general representation of dynamical systems for reservoir computing,"  Dynamical systems are capable of performing computation in a reservoir
computing paradigm. This paper presents a general representation of these
systems as an artificial neural network (ANN). Initially, we implement the
simplest dynamical system, a cellular automaton. The mathematical fundamentals
behind an ANN are maintained, but the weights of the connections and the
activation function are adjusted to work as an update rule in the context of
cellular automata. The advantages of such implementation are its usage on
specialized and optimized deep learning libraries, the capabilities to
generalize it to other types of networks and the possibility to evolve cellular
automata and other dynamical systems in terms of connectivity, update and
learning rules. Our implementation of cellular automata constitutes an initial
step towards a general framework for dynamical systems. It aims to evolve such
systems to optimize their usage in reservoir computing and to model physical
computing substrates.
"
1592,"Evaluation of the criticality of in vitro neuronal networks: Toward an
  assessment of computational capacity","  Novel computing hardwares are necessary to keep up with today's increasing
demand for data storage and processing power. In this research project, we turn
to the brain for inspiration to develop novel computing substrates that are
self-learning, scalable, energy-efficient, and fault-tolerant. The overarching
aim of this work is to develop computational models that are able to reproduce
target behaviors observed in in vitro neuronal networks. These models will be
ultimately be used to aid in the realization of these behaviors in a more
engineerable substrate: an array of nanomagnets. The target behaviors will be
identified by analyzing electrophysiological recordings of the neuronal
networks. Preliminary analysis has been performed to identify when a network is
in a critical state based on the size distribution of network-wide avalanches
of activity, and the results of this analysis are reported here. This
classification of critical versus non-critical networks is valuable in
identifying networks that can be expected to perform well on computational
tasks, as criticality is widely considered to be the state in which a system is
best suited for computation. This type of analysis is expected to enable the
identification of networks that are well-suited for computation and the
classification of networks as perturbed or healthy.
"
1593,"Origin of current-controlled negative differential resistance modes and
  the emergence of composite characteristics with high complexity","  Current-controlled negative differential resistance has significant potential
as a fundamental building block in brain-inspired neuromorphic computing.
However, achieving desired negative differential resistance characteristics,
which is crucial for practical implementation, remains challenging due to
little consensus on the underlying mechanism and unclear design criteria. Here,
we report a material-independent model of current-controlled negative
differential resistance to explain a broad range of characteristics, including
the origin of the discontinuous snap-back response observed in many transition
metal oxides. This is achieved by explicitly accounting for a non-uniform
current distribution in the oxide film and its impact on the effective circuit
of the device, rather than a material-specific phase transition. The
predictions of the model are then compared with experimental observations to
show that the continuous S-type and discontinuous snap-back characteristics
serve as fundamental building blocks for composite behaviour with higher
complexity. Finally, we demonstrate the potential of our approach for
predicting and engineering unconventional compound behaviour with novel
functionality for emerging electronic and neuromorphic computing applications.
"
1594,"Optimization of Quantum Circuit Mapping using Gate Transformation and
  Commutation","  This paper addresses quantum circuit mapping for Noisy Intermediate-Scale
Quantum (NISQ) computers. Since NISQ computers constraint two-qubit operations
on limited couplings, an input circuit must be transformed into an equivalent
output circuit obeying the constraints. The transformation often requires
additional gates that can affect the accuracy of running the circuit. Based
upon a previous work of quantum circuit mapping that leverages gate commutation
rules, this paper shows algorithms that utilize both transformation and
commutation rules. Experiments on a standard benchmark dataset confirm the
algorithms with more rules can find even better circuit mappings compared with
the previously-known best algorithms.
"
1595,"Design and Characterization of Superconducting Nanowire-Based Processors
  for Acceleration of Deep Neural Network Training","  Training of deep neural networks (DNNs) is a computationally intensive task
and requires massive volumes of data transfer. Performing these operations with
the conventional von Neumann architectures creates unmanageable time and power
costs. Recent studies have shown that mixed-signal designs involving crossbar
architectures are capable of achieving acceleration factors as high as 30,000x
over the state of the art digital processors. These approaches involve
utilization of non-volatile memory (NVM) elements as local processors. However,
no technology has been developed to-date that can satisfy the strict device
requirements for the unit cell. This paper presents the superconducting
nanowire-based processing element as a cross-point device. The unit cell has
many programmable non-volatile states that can be used to perform analog
multiplication. Importantly, these states are intrinsically discrete due to
quantization of flux, which provides symmetric switching characteristics.
Operation of these devices in a crossbar is described and verified with
electro-thermal circuit simulations. Finally, validation of the concept in an
actual DNN training task is shown using an emulator.
"
1596,RED: A ReRAM-based Deconvolution Accelerator,"  Deconvolution has been widespread in neural networks. For example, it is
essential for performing unsupervised learning in generative adversarial
networks or constructing fully convolutional networks for semantic
segmentation. Resistive RAM (ReRAM)-based processing-in-memory architecture has
been widely explored in accelerating convolutional computation and demonstrates
good performance. Performing deconvolution on existing ReRAM-based accelerator
designs, however, suffers from long latency and high energy consumption because
deconvolutional computation includes not only convolution but also extra add-on
operations. To realize the more efficient execution for deconvolution, we
analyze its computation requirement and propose a ReRAM-based accelerator
design, namely, RED. More specific, RED integrates two orthogonal methods, the
pixel-wise mapping scheme for reducing redundancy caused by zero-inserting
operations and the zero-skipping data flow for increasing the computation
parallelism and therefore improving performance. Experimental evaluations show
that compared to the state-of-the-art ReRAM-based accelerator, RED can speed up
operation 3.69x~1.15x and reduce 8%~88.36% energy consumption.
"
1597,"Systematic method to evaluate energy dissipation in adiabatic
  quantum-flux-parametron logic","  Adiabatic quantum-flux-parametron (AQFP) logic is an energy-efficient
superconductor logic. It operates with zero static power dissipation and very
low dynamic power dissipation owing to adiabatic switching. In previous
numerical studies, we have evaluated the energy dissipation of basic AQFP logic
gates and demonstrated sub-kBT switching energy, where kB is the Boltzmann's
constant and T is the temperature, by integrating the product of the excitation
current and voltage associated with the gates over time. However, this method
is not applicable to complex logic gates, especially those in which the number
of inputs is different from the number of outputs. In the present study, we
establish a systematic method to evaluate the energy dissipation of general
AQFP logic gates. In the proposed method, the energy dissipation is calculated
by subtracting the energy dissipation of the peripheral circuits from that of
the entire circuit. In this way, the energy change due to the interaction
between gates, which makes it difficult to evaluate the energy dissipation, can
be deducted. We evaluate the energy dissipation of a majority gate using this
method.
"
1598,"Towards Ultra-low-power Realization of Analog Joint Source-Channel
  Coding using MOSFETs","  Certain sensing applications such as Internet of Things (IoTs), where the
sensing phenomenon may change rapidly in both time and space, requires sensors
that consume ultra-low power (so that they do not need to be put to sleep
leading to loss of temporal and spatial resolution) and have low costs (for
high density deployment). A novel encoding based on Metal Oxide Semiconductor
Field Effect Transistors (MOSFETs) is proposed to realize Analog Joint Source
Channel Coding (AJSCC), a low-complexity technique to compress two (or more)
signals into one with controlled distortion. In AJSCC, the y-axis is quantized
while the x-axis is continuously captured. A power-efficient design to support
multiple quantization levels is presented so that the digital receiver can
decide the optimum quantization and the analog transmitter circuit is able to
realize that. The approach is verified via Spice and MATLAB simulations.
"
1599,Benchmarking Physical Performance of Neural Inference Circuits,"  Numerous neural network circuits and architectures are presently under active
research for application to artificial intelligence and machine learning. Their
physical performance metrics (area, time, energy) are estimated. Various types
of neural networks (artificial, cellular, spiking, and oscillator) are
implemented with multiple CMOS and beyond-CMOS (spintronic, ferroelectric,
resistive memory) devices. A consistent and transparent methodology is proposed
and used to benchmark this comprehensive set of options across several
application cases. Promising architecture/device combinations are identified.

wireless channel impairments. The idea is to realize the rectangular-type AJSCC
using Voltage Controlled Voltage Sources (VCVS). The proposal is verified by
Spice simulations as well as breadboard and Printed Circuit Board (PCB)
implementations. Results indicate that the design is feasible for
low-complexity systems like persistent wireless sensor networks requiring low
circuit power.

1601,"A portable potentiometric electronic tongue leveraging smartphone and
  cloud platforms","  Electronic tongues based on potentiometry offer the prospect of rapid and
continuous chemical fingerprinting for portable and remote systems. The present
contribution presents a technology platform including a miniaturized electronic
tongue based on electropolymerized ion-sensitive films, microcontroller-based
data acquisition, a smartphone interface and cloud computing back-end for data
storage and deployment of machine learning models. The sensor array records a
series of differential voltages without use of a true reference electrode and
the resulting time-series potentiometry data is used to train supervised
machine learning algorithms. For trained systems, inferencing tasks such as the
classification of liquids are realized within less than 1 minute including data
acquisition at the edge and inference using the cloud-deployed machine learning
model. Preliminary demonstration of the complete electronic tongue technology
stack is reported for the classification of beverages and mineral water.

1602,On resistance switching and oscillations in tubulin microtubule droplets,"  We study electrical properties of Taxol-stabilised microtubule (MT) ensembles
in a droplet of water. We demonstrate that the MT droplets act as electrical

causes oscillation of the droplet's resistance. The findings will pave a way
towards future designs of MT-based sensing and computing devices, including
data storage and featuring liquid state.

1603,Memristive Devices for Computation-In-Memory,"  CMOS technology and its continuous scaling have made electronics and
computers accessible and affordable for almost everyone on the globe; in
addition, they have enabled the solutions of a wide range of societal problems
and applications. Today, however, both the technology and the computer
architectures are facing severe challenges/walls making them incapable of
providing the demanded computing power with tight constraints. This motivates
the need for the exploration of novel architectures based on new device
technologies; not only to sustain the financial benefit of technology scaling,
but also to develop solutions for extremely demanding emerging applications.
This paper presents two computation-in-memory based accelerators making use of
emerging memristive devices; they are Memristive Vector Processor and RRAM
Automata Processor. The preliminary results of these two accelerators show
significant improvement in terms of latency, energy and area as compared to
today's architectures and design.
"
1604,Analog content addressable memories with memristors,"  A content-addressable-memory compares an input search word against all rows
of stored words in an array in a highly parallel manner. While supplying a very
powerful functionality for many applications in pattern matching and search, it
suffers from large area, cost and power consumption, limiting its use. Past
improvements have been realized by using memristors to replace the
static-random-access-memory cell in conventional designs, but employ similar
schemes based only on binary or ternary states for storage and search.
  We propose a new analog content-addressable-memory concept and circuit to
overcome these limitations by utilizing the analog conductance tunability of
memristors. Our analog content-addressable-memory stores data within the
programmable conductance and can take as input either analog or digital search
values. Experimental demonstrations, scaled simulations and analysis show that
our analog content-addressable-memory can reduce area and power consumption,
which enables the acceleration of existing applications, but also new computing
application areas.
"
1605,"Acoustic Multifunctional Logic Gates and Amplifier based on Passive
  Parity-Time Symmetry","  Acoustic analogue computation and signal processing are of great
significance, however, it's challenging to realize the acoustic computing
devices because of their limitations of single function and complex structure.
In this paper, an acoustic multifunctional device, which can gate or amplify
acoustic waves without resorting to altering the frequency and structure using
a passive acoustic parity-time (PT)-symmetric metamaterial, is realized
theoretically and experimentally. The metamaterial is constructed by five
lossless-loss periodically distributed media which are modulated to achieve the
passive PT symmetry. At the coherent perfect absorber (CPA)-emitter point in
the broken PT-symmetric phase, the logic gates (AND, OR, XOR and NOT) and small
signal amplifier are realized in a single system by adjusting the phase and
amplitude differences between two incoming beams, respectively. This work
provides a new route for the connection between the PT symmetry and the
acoustic metamaterial, which has great potential applications in acoustic
modulation and acoustic multifunctional device.
"
1606,"Adaptive Release Duration Modulation for Limited Molecule Production and
  Storage","  The nature of molecular transmitter imposes some limitations on the molecule
production process and its storage. As the molecules act the role of the
information carriers, the limitations affect the transmission process and the
system performance considerably. In this paper, we focus on the transmitter's
limitations, in particular, the limited molecule production rate and the finite
storage capacity. We consider a time-slotted communication where the
transmitter opens its outlets and releases the stored molecules for a specific
time duration to send bit ""1"" and remains silent to send bit ""0"". By changing
the release duration, we propose an adaptive release duration modulation. The
objective is to find the optimal transmission release duration to minimize the
probability of error. We characterize the properties of the optimal release
duration and use it to derive upper and lower bounds on the system performance.
We see that the proposed modulation scheme improves the performance.
"
1607,Fundamental aspects of noise in analog-hardware neural networks,"  We study and analyze the fundamental aspects of noise propagation in
recurrent as well as deep, multi-layer networks. The main focus of our study
are neural networks in analogue hardware, yet the methodology provides insight
for networks in general. The system under study consists of noisy linear nodes,
and we investigate the signal-to-noise ratio at the network's outputs which is
the upper limit to such a system's computing accuracy. We consider additive and
multiplicative noise which can be purely local as well as correlated across
populations of neurons. This covers the chief internal-perturbations of
hardware networks and noise amplitudes were obtained from a physically
implemented recurrent neural network and therefore correspond to a real-world
system. Analytic solutions agree exceptionally well with numerical data,
enabling clear identification of the most critical components and aspects for
noise management. Focusing on linear nodes isolates the impact of network
connections and allows us to derive strategies for mitigating noise. Our work
is the starting point in addressing this aspect of analogue neural networks,
and our results identify notoriously sensitive points while simultaneously
highlighting the robustness of such computational systems.
"
1608,"A Stochastic-Computing based Deep Learning Framework using Adiabatic
  Quantum-Flux-Parametron SuperconductingTechnology","  The Adiabatic Quantum-Flux-Parametron (AQFP) superconducting technology has
been recently developed, which achieves the highest energy efficiency among
superconducting logic families, potentially huge gain compared with
state-of-the-art CMOS. In 2016, the successful fabrication and testing of
AQFP-based circuits with the scale of 83,000 JJs have demonstrated the
scalability and potential of implementing large-scale systems using AQFP. As a
result, it will be promising for AQFP in high-performance computing and deep
space applications, with Deep Neural Network (DNN) inference acceleration as an
important example. Besides ultra-high energy efficiency, AQFP exhibits two
unique characteristics: the deep pipelining nature since each AQFP logic gate
is connected with an AC clock signal, which increases the difficulty to avoid
RAW hazards; the second is the unique opportunity of true random number
generation (RNG) using a single AQFP buffer, far more efficient than RNG in
CMOS. We point out that these two characteristics make AQFP especially
compatible with the \emph{stochastic computing} (SC) technique, which uses a
time-independent bit sequence for value representation, and is compatible with
the deep pipelining nature. Further, the application of SC has been
investigated in DNNs in prior work, and the suitability has been illustrated as
SC is more compatible with approximate computations. This work is the first to
develop an SC-based DNN acceleration framework using AQFP technology.
"
1609,"Performance and Comparisons of STDP based and Non-STDP based Memristive
  Neural Networks on Hardware","  With the development of research on memristor, memristive neural networks
(MNNs) have become a hot research topic recently. Because memristor can mimic
the spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), the research on STDP based MNNs
is rapidly increasing. However, although state-of-the-art works on STDP based
MNNs have many applications such as pattern recognition, STDP mechanism brings
relatively complex hardware framework and low processing speed, which block
MNNs' hardware realization. A non-STDP based unsupervised MNN is constructed in
this paper. Through the comparison with STDP method on the basis of two common
structures including feedforward and crossbar, non-STDP based MNNs not only
remain the same advantages as STDP based MNNs including high accuracy and
convergence speed in pattern recognition, but also better hardware performance
as few hardware resources and higher processing speed. By virtue of the
combination of memristive character and simple mechanism, non-STDP based MNNs
have better hardware compatibility, which may give a new viewpoint for
memristive neural networks' engineering applications.

1610,Quantum Computing: Lecture Notes,"  This is a set of lecture notes suitable for a Master's course on quantum
computation and information from the perspective of theoretical computer

improvements in subsequent years. The first 10 chapters cover the circuit model

Problem, Grover, quantum walks, Hamiltonian simulation and HHL). They are
followed by 2 chapters about complexity, 4 chapters about distributed (""Alice
and Bob"") settings, and a final chapter about quantum error correction.

1611,"Analysis of Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm under Realistic
  Noise in Superconducting Qubits","  The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is a promising
quantum-classical hybrid technique to solve combinatorial optimization problems
in near-term gate-based noisy quantum devices. In QAOA, the objective is a
function of the quantum state, which itself is a function of the gate
parameters of a multi-level parameterized quantum circuit (PQC). A classical
optimizer varies the continuous gate parameters to generate distributions
(quantum state) with significant support to the optimal solution. Even at the
lowest circuit depth, QAOA offers non-trivial provable performance guarantee
which is expected to increase with the circuit depth. However, the existing
analysis fails to consider non-idealities in the qubit quality i.e., short
lifetime and imperfect gate operations in realistic quantum hardware. In this
article, we investigate the impact of various noise sources on the performance
of QAOA both in simulation and on a real quantum computer from IBM. Our
analyses indicate that the optimal number of stages (p-value) for any QAOA
instance is limited by the noise characteristics (gate error, coherence time,
etc.) of the target hardware as opposed to the current perception that
higher-depth QAOA will provide monotonically better performance for a given
problem compared to the low-depth implementations.

1612,Autonomous Probabilistic Coprocessing with Petaflips per Second,"  In this paper we present a concrete design for a probabilistic (p-) computer
based on a network of p-bits, robust classical entities fluctuating between -1
and +1, with probabilities that are controlled through an input constructed
from the outputs of other p-bits. The architecture of this probabilistic
computer is similar to a stochastic neural network with the p-bit playing the
role of a binary stochastic neuron, but with one key difference: there is no
sequencer used to enforce an ordering of p-bit updates, as is typically
required. Instead, we explore \textit{sequencerless} designs where all p-bits
are allowed to flip autonomously and demonstrate that such designs can allow
ultrafast operation unconstrained by available clock speeds without
compromising the solution's fidelity. Based on experimental results from a
hardware benchmark of the autonomous design and benchmarked device models, we
project that a nanomagnetic implementation can scale to achieve petaflips per
second with millions of neurons. A key contribution of this paper is the focus
on a hardware metric $-$ flips per second $-$ as a problem and
substrate-independent figure-of-merit for an emerging class of hardware
annealers known as Ising Machines. Much like the shrinking feature sizes of
transistors that have continually driven Moore's Law, we believe that flips per
second can be continually improved in later technology generations of a wide
class of probabilistic, domain specific hardware.
"
1613,"Zero-shifting Technique for Deep Neural Network Training on Resistive
  Cross-point Arrays","  A resistive memory device-based computing architecture is one of the
promising platforms for energy-efficient Deep Neural Network (DNN) training
accelerators. The key technical challenge in realizing such accelerators is to
accumulate the gradient information without a bias. Unlike the digital numbers
in software which can be assigned and accessed with desired accuracy, numbers
stored in resistive memory devices can only be manipulated following the
physics of the device, which can significantly limit the training performance.
Therefore, additional techniques and algorithm-level remedies are required to
achieve the best possible performance in resistive memory device-based
accelerators. In this paper, we analyze asymmetric conductance modulation
characteristics in RRAM by Soft-bound synapse model and present an in-depth
analysis on the relationship between device characteristics and DNN model
accuracy using a 3-layer DNN trained on the MNIST dataset. We show that the
imbalance between up and down update leads to a poor network performance. We
introduce a concept of symmetry point and propose a zero-shifting technique
which can compensate imbalance by programming the reference device and changing
the zero value point of the weight. By using this zero-shifting method, we show
that network performance dramatically improves for imbalanced synapse devices.
"
1614,Quantum Advantage and Y2K Bug: Comparison,"  Quantum Computers (QCs), once they mature, will be able to solve some
problems faster than Classic Computers. This phenomenon is called ""quantum
advantage"" (or a stronger term ""quantum supremacy"").
  Quantum advantage will help us to speed up computations in many areas, from
artificial intelligence to medicine. However, QC power can also be leveraged to
break modern cryptographic algorithms, which pervade modern software: use cases
range from encryption of Internet traffic, to encryption of disks, to signing
blockchain ledgers.
  While the exact date when QCs will evolve to reach quantum advantage is
unknown, the consensus is that this future is near. Thus, in order to maintain
crypto agility of the software, one needs to start preparing for the era of
quantum advantage proactively.
  In this paper, we recap the effect of quantum advantage on the existing and
new software systems, as well as the data that we currently store. We also
highlight similarities and differences between the security challenges brought
by QCs and the challenges that software engineers faced twenty years ago while
fixing widespread Y2K bug. Technically, the Y2K bug and the quantum advantage
problems are different: the former was caused by timing-related problems, while
the latter is caused by a cryptographic algorithm being non-quantum-resistant.
However, conceptually, the problems are similar: we know what the root cause
is, the fix (strategically) is straightforward, yet the implementation of the
fix is challenging.
  To address the quantum advantage challenge, we create a seven-step roadmap,
deemed 7E. It is inspired by the lessons-learnt from the Y2K era amalgamated
with modern knowledge. The roadmap gives developers a structured way to start
preparing for the quantum advantage era, helping them to start planning for the
creation of new as well as the evolution of the existent software.
"
1615,Liquid metal solves maze,"  A room temperature liquid metal features a melting point around room
temperature. We use liquid metal gallium due to its non-toxicity. A physical
maze is a connected set of Euclidean domains separated by impassable walls. We
demonstrate that a maze filled with sodium hydroxide solution is solved by a
gallium droplet when direct current is applied between start and destination
loci. During the maze solving the droplet stays compact due to its large
surface tension, navigates along lines of the highest electrical current
density due its high electrical conductivity, and goes around corners of the
maze's corridors due to its high conformability. The droplet maze solver has a
long life-time due to the negligible vapour tension of liquid gallium and its
corrosion resistance and its operation enables computational schemes based on
liquid state devices.
"
1616,Foundational Patterns for Efficient Quantum Computing,"  We present a number of quantum computing patterns that build on top of
fundamental algorithms, that can be applied to solving concrete, NP-hard
problems. In particular, we introduce the concept of a quantum dictionary as a
summation of multiple patterns and algorithms, and show how it can be applied
in the context of Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems.
We start by presenting a visual approach to quantum computing, which avoids a
heavy-reliance on quantum mechanics, linear algebra, or complex mathematical
notation, and favors geometrical intuition and computing paradigms. We also
provide insights on the fundamental quantum computing algorithms (Fourier
Transforms, Phase Estimation, Grover, Quantum Counting, and Amplitude
Estimation) with complete implementations in code.
"
1617,"Photonic reservoir computing based on nonlinear wave dynamics at a
  microscale","  High-dimensional nonlinear dynamical systems including neural networks can be
utilized as a computational resource for information processing. In this sense,
nonlinear wave systems are good candidate for such a computational resource.
Here, we propose and numerically demonstrate information processing based on
nonlinear wave dynamics in microcavity lasers, i.e., optical spatiotemporal
systems at a microscale. One of the remarkable features is the ability of
high-dimensional and nonlinear mapping of input information into the wave
states, enabling efficient and fast information processing at a microscale. We
show that the computational capability for nonlinear/memory tasks is maximized
at the edge of the dynamical stability. Moreover, we also show that the
computational capability can be enhanced by applying a time division
multiplexing technique to the wave dynamics; thus, the computational potential
of the wave dynamics can sufficiently be extracted even when the number of
detectors to monitor the wave states is limited. In addition, we discuss the
merging of optical information processing and optical sensing, opening a novel
method of model-free sensing by using a microcavity reservoir itself as a
sensing element. These results open a way to on-chip photonic computing with
high-dimensional dynamics and a novel model-free sensing scheme.
"
1618,"GPU-based Ising Computing for Solving Balanced Min-Cut Graph
  Partitioning Problem","  Ising computing provides a new computing paradigm for many hard combinatorial
optimization problems. Ising computing essentially tries to solve the quadratic
unconstrained binary optimization problem, which is also described by the Ising
spin glass model and is also the basis for so-called Quantum Annealing
computers. In this work, we propose a novel General Purpose Graphics Processing
Unit (GPGPU) solver for the balanced min-cut graph partitioning problem, which
has many applications in the area of design automation and others. Ising model
solvers for the balanced min-cut partitioning problem have been proposed in the
past. However, they have rarely been demonstrated in existing quantum computers
for many meaningful problem sizes. One difficulty is the fact that the
balancing constraint in the balanced min-cut problem can result in a complete
graph in the Ising model, which makes each local update a global update. Such
global update from each GPU thread will diminish the efficiency of GPU
computing, which favors many localized memory accesses for each thread. To
mitigate this problem, we propose an novel Global Decoupled Ising (GDI) model
and the corresponding annealing algorithm, in which the local update is still
preserved to maintain the efficiency. As a result, the new Ising solver
essentially eliminates the need for the fully connected graph and will use a
more efficient method to track and update global balance without sacrificing
cut quality. Experimental results show that the proposed Ising-based min-cut
partitioning method outperforms the state of art partitioning tool, METIS, on
G-set graph benchmarks in terms of partitioning quality with similar CPU/GPU
times.
"
1619,Quantum Isomer Search,"  Isomer search or molecule enumeration refers to the problem of finding all
the isomers for a given molecule. Many classical search methods have been
developed in order to tackle this problem. However, the availability of quantum
computing architectures has given us the opportunity to address this problem
with new (quantum) techniques. This paper describes a quantum isomer search
procedure for determining all the structural isomers of alkanes. We first
formulate the structural isomer search problem as a quadratic unconstrained
binary optimization (QUBO) problem. The QUBO formulation is for general use on
either annealing or gate-based quantum computers. We use the D-Wave quantum
annealer to enumerate all structural isomers of all alkanes with fewer carbon
atoms (n < 10) than Decane (C10H22). The number of isomer solutions increases
with the number of carbon atoms. We find that the sampling time needed to
identify all solutions scales linearly with the number of carbon atoms in the
alkane. We probe the problem further by employing reverse annealing as well as
a perturbed QUBO Hamiltonian and find that the combination of these two methods
significantly reduces the number of samples required to find all isomers.
"
1620,Liquid Marble Photosensor,"  A liquid marble is a liquid droplet coated by a hydrophobic power. The liquid
marble does not wet adjacent surfaces and therefore can be manipulated as a dry
soft body. A Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction is an oscillatory chemical
reaction exhibiting waves of oxidation. We demonstrate how to make a
photo-sensor from BZ medium liquid marbles. We insert electrodes into a liquid
marble, prepared from BZ solution and coated with polyethylene powder. The
electrodes record a potential difference which oscillates due to oxidation
wave-fronts crossing the electrodes. When the BZ marble is illuminated by a
light source, the oxidation wave-fronts are hindered and, thus, the electrical
potential recorded ceases to oscillate. We characterise several types of
responses of BZ marble photosensors to various stimuli, and provide
explanations of the recorded activity. BZ liquid marble photosensors may find
applications in the fields of liquid electronics, soft robotics and
unconventional computing.
"
1621,Error Analysis of Approximate Array Multipliers,"  Approximate computing is a nascent energy-efficient computing paradigm
suitable for error-tolerant applications. However, the value of approximation
error depends on the applied inputs where individual output error may reach
intolerable level while the average output error is acceptable. Thus, it is
critical to show the response of approximate design for various applied inputs
where understanding the interdependence between the inputs and the
approximation error could be utilized to control the output quality. In this
report, we exhaustively analyze the accuracy of 20 different designs of 8-bit
approximate array multipliers. We designed these multipliers based on various
configurations including the type of approximable component and how much of the
result to approximate, i.e., approximation degree. Accuracy analysis shows a
strong correlation between the applied inputs and the magnitude of the observed
error, i.e., error distance, normalized error distance and peak-to-signal-noise
ratio. We may utilize this input-dependency of approximation error, in
controlling the quality of approximate computing by eliminating large magnitude
errors and improving the quality of the final results.
"
1622,"The Role of Multiplicative Complexity in Compiling Low T-count Oracle
  Circuits","  We present a constructive method to create quantum circuits that implement
oracles $|x\rangle|y\rangle|0\rangle^k \mapsto |x\rangle|y \oplus
f(x)\rangle|0\rangle^k$ for $n$-variable Boolean functions $f$ with low
$T$-count. In our method $f$ is given as a 2-regular Boolean logic network over
the gate basis $\{\land, \oplus, 1\}$. Our construction leads to circuits with
a $T$-count that is at most four times the number of AND nodes in the network.
In addition, we propose a SAT-based method that allows us to trade qubits for
$T$ gates, and explore the space/complexity trade-off of quantum circuits.
  Our constructive method suggests a new upper bound for the number of $T$
gates and ancilla qubits based on the multiplicative complexity $c_\land(f)$ of
the oracle function $f$, which is the minimum number of AND gates that is
required to realize $f$ over the gate basis $\{\land, \oplus, 1\}$. There
exists a quantum circuit computing $f$ with at most $4 c_\land(f)$ $T$ gates
using $k = c_\land(f)$ ancillae. Results known for the multiplicative
complexity of Boolean functions can be transferred.
  We verify our method by comparing it to different state-of-the-art compilers.
Finally, we present our synthesis results for Boolean functions used in quantum
cryptoanalysis.
"
1623,"Switch Elements with S-Shaped Current-Voltage Characteristic in Models
  of Neural Oscillators","  In this paper, we present circuit solutions based on a switch element with
the S-type I-V characteristic implemented using the classic FitzHugh-Nagumo and
FitzHugh-Rinzel models. Using the proposed simplified electrical circuits
allows the modeling of the integrate-and-fire neuron and burst oscillation
modes with the emulation of the mammalian cold receptor patterns. The circuits
were studied using the experimental I-V characteristic of an NbO2 switch with a
stable section of negative differential resistance (NDR) and a VO2 switch with
an unstable NDR, considering the temperature dependences of the threshold
characteristics. The results are relevant for modern neuroelectronics and have
practical significance for the introduction of the neurodynamic models in
circuit design and the brain-machine interface. The proposed systems of
differential equations with the piecewise linear approximation of the S-type
I-V characteristic may be of scientific interest for further analytical and
numerical research and development of neural networks with artificial
intelligence.
"
1624,Knapsack Problem variants of QAOA for battery revenue optimisation,"  We implement two Quantum Approximate Optimisation Algorithm (QAOA) variants
for a battery revenue optimisation problem, equivalent to the weakly NP-hard
Knapsack Problem. Both approaches investigate how to tackle constrained
problems with QAOA. A first 'constrained' approach introduces a quadratic
penalty to enforce the constraint to be respected strictly and reformulates the
problem into an Ising Problem. However, simulations on IBM's simulator
highlight non-convergent results for intermediate depth ($ p\leq 50$). A second
'relaxed' approach applies the QAOA with a non-Ising target function to compute
a linear penalty, running in time $O(p(\log_2 n)^3)$ and needing $O(n \log n)$
qubits. Simulations reveal an exponential improvement over the number of depth
levels and obtain approximations about $0.95$ of the optimum with shallow depth
($p \leq 10$).
"
1625,"3D-aCortex: An Ultra-Compact Energy-Efficient Neurocomputing Platform
  Based on Commercial 3D-NAND Flash Memories","  The first contribution of this paper is the development of extremely dense,
energy-efficient mixed-signal vector-by-matrix-multiplication (VMM) circuits
based on the existing 3D-NAND flash memory blocks, without any need for their
modification. Such compatibility is achieved using time-domain-encoded VMM
design. Our detailed simulations have shown that, for example, the 5-bit VMM of
200-element vectors, using the commercially available 64-layer gate-all-around
macaroni-type 3D-NAND memory blocks designed in the 55-nm technology node, may
provide an unprecedented area efficiency of 0.14 um2/byte and energy efficiency
of ~10 fJ/Op, including the input/output and other peripheral circuitry
overheads. Our second major contribution is the development of 3D-aCortex, a
multi-purpose neuromorphic inference processor that utilizes the proposed
3D-VMM blocks as its core processing units. We have performed rigorous
performance simulations of such a processor on both circuit and system levels,
taking into account non-idealities such as drain-induced barrier lowering,
capacitive coupling, charge injection, parasitics, process variations, and
noise. Our modeling of the 3D-aCortex performing several state-of-the-art
neuromorphic-network benchmarks has shown that it may provide the
record-breaking storage efficiency of 4.34 MB/mm2, the peak energy efficiency
of 70.43 TOps/J, and the computational throughput up to 10.66 TOps/s. The
storage efficiency can be further improved seven-fold by aggressively sharing
VMM peripheral circuits at the cost of slight decrease in energy efficiency and
throughput.
"
1626,"Reconfigurable nanoscale spin wave majority gate with frequency-division
  multiplexing","  Spin waves are excitations in ferromagnetic media that have been proposed as
information carriers in spintronic devices with potentially much lower
operation power than conventional charge-based electronics. The wave nature of
spin waves can be exploited to design majority gates by coding information in
their phase and using interference for computation. However, a scalable spin
wave majority gate design that can be co-integrated alongside conventional
Si-based electronics is still lacking. Here, we demonstrate a reconfigurable
nanoscale inline spin wave majority gate with ultrasmall footprint,
frequency-division multiplexing, and fan-out. Time-resolved imaging of the
magnetisation dynamics by scanning transmission x-ray microscopy reveals the
operation mode of the device and validates the full logic majority truth table.
All-electrical spin wave spectroscopy further demonstrates spin wave majority
gates with sub-micron dimensions, sub-micron spin wave wavelengths, and
reconfigurable input and output ports. We also show that interference-based
computation allows for frequency-division multiplexing as well as the
computation of different logic functions in the same device. Such devices can
thus form the foundation of a future spin-wave-based superscalar vector
computing platform.
"
1627,"Addressing Limited Weight Resolution in a Fully Optical Neuromorphic
  Reservoir Computing Readout","  Using optical hardware for neuromorphic computing has become more and more
popular recently due to its efficient high-speed data processing capabilities
and low power consumption. However, there are still some remaining obstacles to
realizing the vision of a completely optical neuromorphic computer. One of them
is that, depending on the technology used, optical weighting elements may not
share the same resolution as in the electrical domain. Moreover, noise and
drift are important considerations as well. In this article, we investigate a
new method for improving the performance of optical weighting, even in the
presence of noise and in the case of very low resolution. Even with only 8 to
32 levels of resolution, the method can outperform the naive traditional
low-resolution weighting by several orders of magnitude in terms of bit error
rate and can deliver performance very close to full-resolution weighting
elements, also in noisy environments.
"
1628,"Chemical Reactions-Based Microfluidic Transmitter and Receiver for
  Molecular Communication","  The design of communication systems capable of processing and exchanging
information through molecules and chemical processes is a rapidly growing
interdisciplinary field, which holds the promise to revolutionize how we
realize computing and communication devices. While molecular communication (MC)
theory has had major developments in recent years, more practical aspects in
designing components capable of MC functionalities remain less explored.
Motivated by this, we design a microfluidic MC system with a microfluidic MC
transmitter and a microfluidic MC receiver based on chemical reactions.
Considering existing MC literature on information transmission via molecular
pulse modulation, the proposed microfluidic MC transmitter is capable of
generating continuously predefined pulse-shaped molecular concentrations upon
rectangular triggering signals using chemical reactions inspired by how cells
generate pulse-shaped molecular signals in biology. We further design a
microfluidic MC receiver capable of demodulating a received signal to a
rectangular output signal using a thresholding reaction and an amplifying
reaction. Our chemical reactions-based microfluidic molecular communication
system is reproducible and well-designed, and more importantly, it overcomes
the slow-speed, unreliability, and non-scalability of biological processes in
cells. To reveal design insights, we also derive the theoretical signal
responses for our designed microfluidic transmitter and receiver, which further
facilitate the transmitter design optimization. Our theoretical results are
validated via simulations performed through the COMSOL Multiphysics finite
element solver. We demonstrate the predefined nature of the generated pulse and
the demodulated rectangular signal together with their dependence on design
parameters.
"
1629,"A Modern Approach to IP Protection and Trojan Prevention: Split
  Manufacturing for 3D ICs and Obfuscation of Vertical Interconnects","  Split manufacturing (SM) and layout camouflaging (LC) are two promising
techniques to obscure integrated circuits (ICs) from malicious entities during
and after manufacturing. While both techniques enable protecting the
intellectual property (IP) of ICs, SM can further mitigate the insertion of
hardware Trojans (HTs). In this paper, we strive for the ""best of both worlds,""
that is we seek to combine the individual strengths of SM and LC. By jointly
extending SM and LC techniques toward 3D integration, an up-and-coming paradigm
based on stacking and interconnecting of multiple chips, we establish a modern
approach to hardware security. Toward that end, we develop a security-driven
CAD and manufacturing flow for 3D ICs in two variations, one for IP protection
and one for HT prevention. Essential concepts of that flow are (i) ""3D
splitting"" of the netlist to protect, (ii) obfuscation of the vertical
interconnects (i.e., the wiring between stacked chips), and (iii) for HT
prevention, a security-driven synthesis stage. We conduct comprehensive
experiments on DRC-clean layouts of multi-million-gate DARPA and OpenCores
designs (and others). Strengthened by extensive security analysis for both IP
protection and HT prevention, we argue that entering the third dimension is
eminent for effective and efficient hardware security.
"
1630,"Digital Biologically Plausible Implementation of Binarized Neural
  Networks with Differential Hafnium Oxide Resistive Memory Arrays","  The brain performs intelligent tasks with extremely low energy consumption.
This work takes inspiration from two strategies used by the brain to achieve
this energy efficiency: the absence of separation between computing and memory
functions, and the reliance on low precision computation. The emergence of
resistive memory technologies indeed provides an opportunity to co-integrate
tightly logic and memory in hardware. In parallel, the recently proposed
concept of Binarized Neural Network, where multiplications are replaced by
exclusive NOR (XNOR) logic gates, offers a way to implement artificial
intelligence using very low precision computation. In this work, we therefore
propose a strategy to implement low energy Binarized Neural Networks, which
employs brain-inspired concepts, while retaining energy benefits from digital
electronics. We design, fabricate and test a memory array, including periphery
and sensing circuits, optimized for this in-memory computing scheme. Our
circuit employs hafnium oxide resistive memory integrated in the back end of
line of a 130 nanometer CMOS process, in a two transistors - two resistors
cell, which allows performing the exclusive NOR operations of the neural
network directly within the sense amplifiers. We show, based on extensive
electrical measurements, that our design allows reducing the amount of bit
errors on the synaptic weights, without the use of formal error correcting
codes. We design a whole system using this memory array. We show on standard
machine learning tasks (MNIST, CIFAR-10, ImageNet and an ECG task) that the
system has an inherent resilience to bit errors. We evidence that its energy
consumption is attractive compared to more standard approaches, and that it can
use the memory devices in regimes where they exhibit particularly low
programming energy and high endurance.
"
1631,"Implementing Binarized Neural Networks with Magnetoresistive RAM without
  Error Correction","  One of the most exciting applications of Spin Torque Magnetoresistive Random
Access Memory (ST-MRAM) is the in-memory implementation of deep neural
networks, which could allow improving the energy efficiency of Artificial
Intelligence by orders of magnitude with regards to its implementation on
computers and graphics cards. In particular, ST-MRAM could be ideal for
implementing Binarized Neural Networks (BNNs), a type of deep neural networks
discovered in 2016, which can achieve state-of-the-art performance with a
highly reduced memory footprint with regards to conventional artificial
intelligence approaches. The challenge of ST-MRAM, however, is that it is prone
to write errors and usually requires the use of error correction. In this work,
we show that these bit errors can be tolerated by BNNs to an outstanding level,
based on examples of image recognition tasks (MNIST, CIFAR-10 and ImageNet):
bit error rates of ST-MRAM up to 0.1% have little impact on recognition
accuracy. The requirements for ST-MRAM are therefore considerably relaxed for
BNNs with regards to traditional applications. By consequence, we show that for
BNNs, ST-MRAMs can be programmed with weak (low-energy) programming conditions,
without error correcting codes. We show that this result can allow the use of
low energy and low area ST-MRAM cells, and show that the energy savings at the
system level can reach a factor two.

1632,Energy and Performance Analysis of STTRAM Caches for Mobile Applications,"  Spin-Transfer Torque RAMs (STTRAMs) have been shown to offer much promise for
implementing emerging cache architectures. This paper studies the viability of
STTRAM caches for mobile workloads from the perspective of energy and latency.
Specifically, we explore the benefits of reduced retention STTRAM caches for
mobile applications. We analyze the characteristics of mobile applications'
cache blocks and how those characteristics dictate the appropriate retention
time for mobile device caches. We show that due to their inherently interactive
nature, mobile applications' execution characteristics---and hence, STTRAM
cache design requirements---differ from other kinds of applications. We also
explore various STTRAM cache designs in both single and multicore systems, and
at different cache levels, that can efficiently satisfy mobile applications'
execution requirements, in order to maximize energy savings without introducing
substantial latency overhead.
"
1633,Improved circuits for a biologically-inspired random pulse computer,"  We present improved circuits intended for building a universal computer based
on Random Pulse Computing (RPC) paradigm, a biologically-inspired way of
computation in which variable is represented by a frequency of a Random Pulse
Train (RPT) rather than a logic state. The RPC we mention here is also known as
""stochastic unipolar computation"" in newer literature. Unlike in previous art,
where randomness is obtained from electronics noise or a pseudorandom shift
register while processing circuitry is deterministic, in our approach both
variable generation and signal processing rely on the random flip-flop (RFF)
whose randomness is derived from a fundamentally random quantum process. This
offers advantage in better precision and faster calculation.

1634,"Observation of Highly Nonlinear Resistive Switching of Al2O3/TiO2-x
  Memristors at Cryogenic Temperature (1.5 K)","  In this work, we investigate the behavior of Al2O3/TiO2-x cross-point
memristors in cryogenic environment. We report successful resistive switching
of memristor devices from 300 K down to 1.5 K. The I-V curves exhibit negative
differential resistance effects between 130 and 1.5 K, attributed to a
metal-insulator transition (MIT) of the Ti4O7 conductive filament. The
resulting highly nonlinear behavior is associated to a maximum ION/IOFF ratio
of 84 at 1.5 K, paving the way to selector-free cryogenic passive crossbars.
Finally, temperature-dependant thermal activation energies related to the
conductance at low bias (20 mV) are extracted for memristors in low resistance
state, suggesting hopping-type conduction mechanisms.
"
1635,Covert Computation in Self-Assembled Circuits,"  Traditionally, computation within self-assembly models is hard to conceal
because the self-assembly process generates a crystalline assembly whose
computational history is inherently part of the structure itself. With no way
to remove information from the computation, this computational model offers a
unique problem: how can computational input and computation be hidden while
still computing and reporting the final output? Designing such systems is
inherently motivated by privacy concerns in biomedical computing and
applications in cryptography.
  In this paper we propose the problem of performing ``covert computation''
within tile self-assembly that seeks to design self-assembly systems that
``conceal'' both the input and computational history of performed computations.
We achieve these results within the growth-only restricted abstract Tile
Assembly Model (aTAM) with positive and negative interactions. We show that
general-case covert computation is possible by implementing a set of basic
covert logic gates capable of simulating any circuit (functionally complete).
To further motivate the study of covert computation, we apply our new framework
to resolve an outstanding complexity question; we use our covert circuitry to
show that the unique assembly verification problem within the growth-only aTAM
with negative interactions is coNP-complete.
"
1636,"A clock-less ultra-low power bit-serial LVDS link for Address-Event
  multi-chip systems","  We present a power efficient clock-less fully asynchronous bit-serial Low
Voltage Differential Signaling (LVDS) link with event-driven instant wake-up
and self-sleep features, optimized for high speed inter-chip communication of
asynchronous address-events between neuromorphic chips. The proposed LVDS link
makes use of the Level-Encoded Dual-Rail (LEDR) representation and a token-ring
architecture to encode and transmit data, avoiding the use of conventional
large ClockData Recovery (CDR) modules with power-hungry DLL or PLL circuits.
We implemented the LVDS circuits in a device fabricated with a standard 0.18 um
CMOS process. The total silicon area used for such block is of 0.14 mm^2. We
present experimental measurement results to demonstrate that, with a bit rate
of 1.5 Gbps and an event width of 32-bit, the proposed LVDS link can achieve
transmission event rates of 35.7 M Events/second with current consumption of
19.3 mA and 3.57 mA for receiver and transmitter blocks, respectively. Given
the clock-less and instant on/off design choices made, the power consumption of
the whole link depends linearly on the data transmission rate. We show that the
current consumption can go down to sub-uA for low event rates (e.g., <1k
Events/second), with a floor of 80 nA for transmitter and 42 nA for receiver,
determined mainly by static off-leakage currents.
"
1637,"An auto-scaling wide dynamic range current to frequency converter for
  real-time monitoring of signals in neuromorphic systems","  Neuromorphic systems typically employ current-mode circuits that model neural
dynamics and produce output currents that range from few pico-Amperes to
hundreds of micro-Amperes. On-line real-time monitoring of the signals produced
by these circuits is crucial, for prototyping and debugging purposes, as well
as for analyzing and understanding the network dynamics and computational
properties. To this end, we propose a compact on-chip auto-scaling Current to
Frequency Converter (CFC) for real-time monitoring of analog currents in
mixed-signal/analog neuromorphic electronic systems. The proposed CFC is a
self-timed asynchronous circuit that has a wide dynamic input range of up to 6
decades, ranging from pico-Amps to micro-Amps, with high current measurement
sensitivity. To produce a linear output frequency response, while properly
covering the wide dynamic input range, the circuit automatically detects the
scale of the input current and adjusts the scale of its output firing rate
accordingly. Here we describe the proposed circuit and present experimental
results measured from multiple instances of the circuit, implemented using a
standard 180 nm CMOS process, and interfaced to silicon neuron and synapse
circuits for real-time current monitoring. We demonstrate how the circuit is
suitable for measuring neural dynamics by showing the converted response
properties of the chip silicon neurons and synapses as they are stimulated by
input spikes.

1638,"Scaling mixed-signal neuromorphic processors to 28 nm FD-SOI
  technologies","  As processes continue to scale aggressively, the design of deep sub-micron,
mixed-signal design is becoming more and more challenging. In this paper we
present an analysis of scaling multi-core mixed-signal neuromorphic processors
to advanced 28 nm FD-SOI nodes. We address analog design issues which arise
from the use of advanced process, including the problem of large leakage
currents and device mismatch, and asynchronous digital design issues. We
present the outcome of Monte Carlo Analysis and circuit simulations of
neuromorphic sub threshold analog/digital neuron circuits which reproduce
biologically plausible responses. We describe the AER used to implement PCHB
based asynchronous QDI routing processes in multi-core neuromorphic
architectures and validate their operation via circuit simulation results.
Finally we describe the implementation of custom 28 nm CAM based memory
resources utilized in these multi-core neuromorphic processor and discuss the
possibility of increasing density by using advanced RRAM devices integrated in
the 28 nm Fully-Depleted Silicon on Insulator (FD-SOI) process.
"
1639,"Automatic gain control of ultra-low leakage synaptic scaling homeostatic
  plasticity circuits","  Homeostatic plasticity is a stabilizing mechanism that allows neural systems
to maintain their activity around a functional operating point. This is an
extremely useful mechanism for neuromorphic computing systems, as it can be
used to compensate for chronic shifts, for example due to changes in the
network structure. However, it is important that this plasticity mechanism
operates on time scales that are much longer than conventional synaptic
plasticity ones, in order to not interfere with the learning process. In this
paper we present a novel ultra-low leakage cell and an automatic gain control
scheme that can adapt the gain of analog log-domain synapse circuits over
extremely long time scales. To validate the proposed scheme, we implemented the
ultra-low leakage cell in a standard 180 nm Complementary
Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS) process, and integrated it in an array of
dynamic synapses connected to an adaptive integrate and fire neuron. We
describe the circuit and demonstrate how it can be configured to scale the gain
of all synapses afferent to the silicon neuron in a way to keep the neuron's
average firing rate constant around a set operating point. The circuit occupies
a silicon area of 84 {\mu}m x 22 {\mu}m and consumes approximately 10.8 nW with
a 1.8 V supply voltage. It exhibits time constants of up to 25 kilo-seconds,
thanks to a controllable leakage current that can be scaled down to 1.2
atto-Amps (7.5 electrons/s).
"
1640,"Implications of Quantum Computing for Artificial Intelligence alignment
  research","  We explain some key features of quantum computing via three heuristics and
apply them to argue that a deep understanding of quantum computing is unlikely
to be helpful to address current bottlenecks in Artificial Intelligence
Alignment. Our argument relies on the claims that Quantum Computing leads to
compute overhang instead of algorithmic overhang, and that the difficulties
associated with the measurement of quantum states do not invalidate any major
assumptions of current Artificial Intelligence Alignment research agendas. We
also discuss tripwiring, adversarial blinding, informed oversight and side
effects as possible exceptions.
"
1641,"Analog circuits for mixed-signal neuromorphic computing architectures in
  28 nm FD-SOI technology","  Developing mixed-signal analog-digital neuromorphic circuits in advanced
scaled processes poses significant design challenges. We present compact and
energy efficient sub-threshold analog synapse and neuron circuits, optimized
for a 28 nm FD-SOI process, to implement massively parallel large-scale
neuromorphic computing systems. We describe the techniques used for maximizing
density with mixed-mode analog/digital synaptic weight configurations, and the
methods adopted for minimizing the effect of channel leakage current, in order
to implement efficient analog computation based on pA-nA small currents. We
present circuit simulation results, based on a new chip that has been recently
taped out, to demonstrate how the circuits can be useful for both low-frequency
operation in systems that need to interact with the environment in real-time,
and for high-frequency operation for fast data processing in different types of
spiking neural network architectures.
"
1642,"Design space exploration of Ferroelectric FET based Processing-in-Memory
  DNN Accelerator","  In this letter, we quantify the impact of device limitations on the
classification accuracy of an artificial neural network, where the synaptic
weights are implemented in a Ferroelectric FET (FeFET) based in-memory
processing architecture. We explore a design-space consisting of the resolution
of the analog-to-digital converter, number of bits per FeFET cell, and the
neural network depth. We show how the system architecture, training models and
overparametrization can address some of the device limitations.
"
1643,"Enabling and Exploiting Partition-Level Parallelism (PALP) in Phase
  Change Memories","  Phase-change memory (PCM) devices have multiple banks to serve memory
requests in parallel. Unfortunately, if two requests go to the same bank, they
have to be served one after another, leading to lower system performance. We
observe that a modern PCM bank is implemented as a collection of partitions
that operate mostly independently while sharing a few global peripheral
structures, which include the sense amplifiers (to read) and the write drivers
(to write). Based on this observation, we propose PALP, a new mechanism that
enables partition-level parallelism within each PCM bank, and exploits such
parallelism by using the memory controller's access scheduling decisions. PALP
consists of three new contributions. First, we introduce new PCM commands to
enable parallelism in a bank's partitions in order to resolve the read-write
bank conflicts, with minimal changes needed to PCM logic and its interface.
Second, we propose simple circuit modifications that introduce a new operating
mode for the write drivers, in addition to their default mode of serving write
requests. When configured in this new mode, the write drivers can resolve the
read-read bank conflicts, working jointly with the sense amplifiers. Finally,
we propose a new access scheduling mechanism in PCM that improves performance
by prioritizing those requests that exploit partition-level parallelism over
other requests, including the long outstanding ones. While doing so, the memory
controller also guarantees starvation-freedom and the PCM's
running-average-power-limit (RAPL). We evaluate PALP with workloads from the
MiBench and SPEC CPU2017 Benchmark suites. Our results show that PALP reduces
average PCM access latency by 23%, and improves average system performance by
28% compared to the state-of-the-art approaches.
"
1644,Reservoir-size dependent learning in analogue neural networks,"  The implementation of artificial neural networks in hardware substrates is a
major interdisciplinary enterprise. Well suited candidates for physical
implementations must combine nonlinear neurons with dedicated and efficient
hardware solutions for both connectivity and training. Reservoir computing
addresses the problems related with the network connectivity and training in an
elegant and efficient way. However, important questions regarding impact of
reservoir size and learning routines on the convergence-speed during learning
remain unaddressed. Here, we study in detail the learning process of a recently
demonstrated photonic neural network based on a reservoir. We use a greedy
algorithm to train our neural network for the task of chaotic signals
prediction and analyze the learning-error landscape. Our results unveil
fundamental properties of the system's optimization hyperspace. Particularly,
we determine the convergence speed of learning as a function of reservoir size
and find exceptional, close to linear scaling. This linear dependence, together
with our parallel diffractive coupling, represent optimal scaling conditions
for our photonic neural network scheme.
"
1645,Mapping of Local and Global Synapses on Spiking Neuromorphic Hardware,"  Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are widely deployed to solve complex pattern
recognition, function approximation and image classification tasks. With the
growing size and complexity of these networks, hardware implementation becomes
challenging because scaling up the size of a single array (crossbar) of fully
connected neurons is no longer feasible due to strict energy budget. Modern
neromorphic hardware integrates small-sized crossbars with time-multiplexed
interconnects. Partitioning SNNs becomes essential in order to map them on
neuromorphic hardware with the major aim to reduce the global communication
latency and energy overhead. To achieve this goal, we propose our instantiation
of particle swarm optimization, which partitions SNNs into local synapses
(mapped on crossbars) and global synapses (mapped on time-multiplexed
interconnects), with the objective of reducing spike communication on the
interconnect. This improves latency, power consumption as well as application
performance by reducing inter-spike interval distortion and spike disorders.
Our framework is implemented in Python, interfacing CARLsim, a GPU-accelerated
application-level spiking neural network simulator with an extended version of
Noxim, for simulating time-multiplexed interconnects. Experiments are conducted
with realistic and synthetic SNN-based applications with different computation
models, topologies and spike coding schemes. Using power numbers from in-house
neuromorphic chips, we demonstrate significant reductions in energy consumption
and spike latency over PACMAN, the widely-used partitioning technique for SNNs
on SpiNNaker.
"
1646,Artificial Spin Ice Phase-Change Memory Resistors,"  We study the implications of the anisotropic magnetic resistance on permalloy
nanowires, and in particular on the property of the resistance depending on the
type of lattice. We discuss how the internal spin configuration of artificial
spin ice nanowires can affect their effective resistive state, and which
mechanisms can introduce a current-dependent effect dynamic resistive state. We
discuss a spin-induced thermal phase-change mechanism, and an athermal
domain-wall spin inversion. In both cases we observe memory behavior
reminiscent of a memristor, with an I-V hysteretic pinched behavior.
"
1647,Single-electron tunneling PbS/InP neuromorphic computing building blocks,"  We study single-electron tunneling (SET) characteristics in crystalline
PbS/InP junctions, that exhibit single-electron Coulomb-blockade staircases
along with memory and memory-fading behaviors. This gives rise to both
short-term and long-term plasticities as well as a convenient non-linear
response, making this structure attractive for neuromorphic computing
applications. For further insights into this prospect, we predict typical
behaviors relevant to the field, obtained by an extrapolation of experimental
data in the SET framework. The estimated minimum energy required for a synaptic
operation is in the order of 1 fJ, while the maximum frequency of operation can
reach the MHz range.
"
1648,Contract-based verification of a realistic quantum compiler,"  In this paper, we present CertiQ, a mostly-automated verification framework
for the Qiskit quantum compiler. To our knowledge, CertiQ is the first effort
to apply formal verification and SMT reasoning to a real-world quantum
compiler. Qiskit is currently the most complete and widely-used open-source
quantum software stack from low-level compilation to high-level quantum
algorithms. With growing community contributions, the Qiskit compiler is in
need of code quality control and verification down to the compilation level to
guarantee reliability of scientific work that uses it. CertiQ is deeply
integrated into the Qiskit compiler (called Terra), providing abstract
specifications for quantum compiler data structures and offering verifiable
contracts that specify the behaviors of compilation phases with heavy
optimizations. CertiQ enables verification of the existing implementation of
the Qiskit compiler and future code submissions in a mostly-automated manner
using invariant-guided contracts and contract continuation. With these
techniques in place, developers need to provide limited inputs only where
function contracts and loop invariant cannot be inferred automatically. The
CertiQ verification procedure discovers several critical bugs, some of which
are unique to quantum soft-ware. Our extensive case studies on four compiler
phases of Qiskit demonstrate that CertiQ is effective for verification of
quantum compilers with a low proof burden.
"
1649,Neuromorphic Electronic Systems for Reservoir Computing,"  This chapter provides a comprehensive survey of the researches and
motivations for hardware implementation of reservoir computing (RC) on
neuromorphic electronic systems. Due to its computational efficiency and the
fact that training amounts to a simple linear regression, both spiking and
non-spiking implementations of reservoir computing on neuromorphic hardware
have been developed. Here, a review of these experimental studies is provided
to illustrate the progress in this area and to address the technical challenges
which arise from this specific hardware implementation. Moreover, to deal with
challenges of computation on such unconventional substrates, several lines of
potential solutions are presented based on advances in other computational
approaches in machine learning. Keywords: Analog Microchips, FPGA, Memristors,

"
1650,"Tiny but Accurate: A Pruned, Quantized and Optimized Memristor Crossbar
  Framework for Ultra Efficient DNN Implementation","  The state-of-art DNN structures involve intensive computation and high memory
storage. To mitigate the challenges, the memristor crossbar array has emerged
as an intrinsically suitable matrix computation and low-power acceleration
framework for DNN applications. However, the high accuracy solution for extreme
model compression on memristor crossbar array architecture is still waiting for
unraveling. In this paper, we propose a memristor-based DNN framework which
combines both structured weight pruning and quantization by incorporating
alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm for better pruning
and quantization performance. We also discover the non-optimality of the ADMM
solution in weight pruning and the unused data path in a structured pruned
model. Motivated by these discoveries, we design a software-hardware
co-optimization framework which contains the first proposed Network
Purification and Unused Path Removal algorithms targeting on post-processing a
structured pruned model after ADMM steps. By taking memristor hardware
constraints into our whole framework, we achieve extreme high compression ratio
on the state-of-art neural network structures with minimum accuracy loss. For
quantizing structured pruned model, our framework achieves nearly no accuracy
loss after quantizing weights to 8-bit memristor weight representation. We
share our models at anonymous link https://bit.ly/2VnMUy0.
"
1651,Learning Algebraic Models of Quantum Entanglement,"  We give a thorough overview of supervised learning and network design for
learning membership on algebraic varieties via deep neural networks. We show
how artificial neural networks can be trained to predict the entanglement type
for quantum states. We give examples for detecting degenerate states, as well
as border rank classification for up to 5 binary qubits and 3 qutrits (ternary
qubits).
"
1652,Practical implementation of a quantum backtracking algorithm,"  In previous work, Montanaro presented a method to obtain quantum speedups for
backtracking algorithms, a general meta-algorithm to solve constraint
satisfaction problems (CSPs). In this work, we derive a space efficient
implementation of this method. Assume that we want to solve a CSP with $m$
constraints on $n$ variables and that the union of the domains in which these
variables take their value is of cardinality $d$. Then, we show that the
implementation of Montanaro's backtracking algorithm can be done by using $O(n
\log d)$ data qubits. We detail an implementation of the predicate associated
to the CSP with an additional register of $O(\log m)$ qubits. We explicit our
implementation for graph coloring and SAT problems, and present simulation
results. Finally, we discuss the impact of the usage of static and dynamic
variable ordering heuristics in the quantum setting.
"
1653,A Machine Learning Accelerator In-Memory for Energy Harvesting,"  There is increasing demand to bring machine learning capabilities to low
power devices. By integrating the computational power of machine learning with
the deployment capabilities of low power devices, a number of new applications
become possible. In some applications, such devices will not even have a
battery, and must rely solely on energy harvesting techniques. This puts
extreme constraints on the hardware, which must be energy efficient and capable
of tolerating interruptions due to power outages. Here, as a representative
example, we propose an in-memory support vector machine learning accelerator
utilizing non-volatile spintronic memory. The combination of
processing-in-memory and non-volatility provides a key advantage in that
progress is effectively saved after every operation. This enables instant shut
down and restart capabilities with minimal overhead. Additionally, the
operations are highly energy efficient leading to low power consumption.
"
1654,"An Ultra-Efficient Memristor-Based DNN Framework with Structured Weight
  Pruning and Quantization Using ADMM","  The high computation and memory storage of large deep neural networks (DNNs)
models pose intensive challenges to the conventional Von-Neumann architecture,
incurring substantial data movements in the memory hierarchy. The memristor
crossbar array has emerged as a promising solution to mitigate the challenges
and enable low-power acceleration of DNNs. Memristor-based weight pruning and
weight quantization have been seperately investigated and proven effectiveness
in reducing area and power consumption compared to the original DNN model.
However, there has been no systematic investigation of memristor-based
neuromorphic computing (NC) systems considering both weight pruning and weight
quantization. In this paper, we propose an unified and systematic
memristor-based framework considering both structured weight pruning and weight
quantization by incorporating alternating direction method of multipliers
(ADMM) into DNNs training. We consider hardware constraints such as crossbar
blocks pruning, conductance range, and mismatch between weight value and real
devices, to achieve high accuracy and low power and small area footprint. Our
framework is mainly integrated by three steps, i.e., memristor-based ADMM
regularized optimization, masked mapping and retraining. Experimental results
show that our proposed framework achieves 29.81X (20.88X) weight compression
ratio, with 98.38% (96.96%) and 98.29% (97.47%) power and area reduction on
VGG-16 (ResNet-18) network where only have 0.5% (0.76%) accuracy loss, compared
to the original DNN models. We share our models at link http://bit.ly/2Jp5LHJ.
"
1655,Homogeneous Models of Nonlinear Circuits,"  This paper develops a general approach to nonlinear circuit modelling aimed
at preserving the intrinsic symmetry of electrical circuits when formulating
reduced models. The goal is to provide a framework accommodating such
reductions in a global manner and without any loss of generality in the working
assumptions; that is, we avoid global hypotheses imposing the existence of a
classical circuit variable controlling each device. Classical (voltage/current
but also flux/charge) models are easily obtained as particular cases of a
general homogeneous model. Our approach extends the results introduced for
linear circuits in a previous paper, by means of a systematic use of global
parametrizations of smooth planar curves. This makes it possible to formulate
reduced models in terms of homogeneous variables also in the nonlinear context:
contrary to voltages and currents (and also to fluxes and charges), homogeneous
variables qualify as state variables in reduced models of uncoupled circuits
without any restriction in the characteristics of devices. The inherent
symmetry of this formalism makes it possible to address in broad generality
certain analytical problems in nonlinear circuit theory, such as the
state-space problem and related issues involving impasse phenomena, as well as
index analyses of differential-algebraic models. Our framework applies also to
circuits with memristors, and can be extended to include controlled sources and
coupling effects. Several examples illustrate the results.
"
1656,"Spiking Neural Networks for Inference and Learning: A Memristor-based
  Design Perspective","  On metrics of density and power efficiency, neuromorphic technologies have
the potential to surpass mainstream computing technologies in tasks where
real-time functionality, adaptability, and autonomy are essential. While
algorithmic advances in neuromorphic computing are proceeding successfully, the
potential of memristors to improve neuromorphic computing have not yet born
fruit, primarily because they are often used as a drop-in replacement to
conventional memory. However, interdisciplinary approaches anchored in machine
learning theory suggest that multifactor plasticity rules matching neural and
synaptic dynamics to the device capabilities can take better advantage of
memristor dynamics and its stochasticity. Furthermore, such plasticity rules
generally show much higher performance than that of classical Spike Time
Dependent Plasticity (STDP) rules. This chapter reviews the recent development
in learning with spiking neural network models and their possible
implementation with memristor-based hardware.
"
1657,Mapping Spiking Neural Networks to Neuromorphic Hardware,"  Neuromorphic hardware platforms implement biological neurons and synapses to
execute spiking neural networks (SNNs) in an energy-efficient manner. We
present SpiNeMap, a design methodology to map SNNs to crossbar-based
neuromorphic hardware, minimizing spike latency and energy consumption.
SpiNeMap operates in two steps: SpiNeCluster and SpiNePlacer. SpiNeCluster is a
heuristic-based clustering technique to partition SNNs into clusters of
synapses, where intracluster local synapses are mapped within crossbars of the
hardware and inter-cluster global synapses are mapped to the shared
interconnect. SpiNeCluster minimizes the number of spikes on global synapses,
which reduces spike congestion on the shared interconnect, improving
application performance. SpiNePlacer then finds the best placement of local and
global synapses on the hardware using a meta-heuristic-based approach to
minimize energy consumption and spike latency. We evaluate SpiNeMap using
synthetic and realistic SNNs on the DynapSE neuromorphic hardware. We show that
SpiNeMap reduces average energy consumption by 45% and average spike latency by
21%, compared to state-of-the-art techniques.
"
1658,"Self-organizing memristive nanowire networks with structural plasticity
  emulate biological neuronal circuits","  Acting as artificial synapses, two-terminal memristive devices are considered
fundamental building blocks for the realization of artificial neural networks.
Organized into large arrays with a top-down approach, memristive devices in
conventional crossbar architecture demonstrated the implementation of
brain-inspired computing for supervised and unsupervised learning. Alternative
way using unconventional systems consisting of many interacting nano-parts have
been proposed for the realization of biologically plausible architectures where
the emergent behavior arises from a complexity similar to that of biological
neural circuits. However, these systems were unable to demonstrate
bio-realistic implementation of synaptic functionalities with spatio-temporal
processing of input signals similarly to our brain. Here we report on emergent
synaptic behavior of biologically inspired nanoarchitecture based on
self-assembled and highly interconnected nanowire (NW) networks realized with a
bottom up approach. The operation principle of this system is based on the
mutual electrochemical interaction among memristive NWs and NW junctions
composing the network and regulating its connectivity depending on the input
stimuli. The functional connectivity of the system was shown to be responsible
for heterosynaptic plasticity that was experimentally demonstrated and modelled
in a multiterminal configuration, where the formation of a synaptic pathway
between two neuron terminals is responsible for a variation in synaptic
strength also at non-stimulated terminals. These results highlight the ability
of nanowire memristive architectures for building brain-inspired intelligent
systems based on complex networks able to physically compute the information
arising from multi-terminal inputs.

1659,"Utilizing Neurons for Digital Logic Circuits: A Molecular Communications
  Analysis","  With the advancement of synthetic biology, several new tools have been
conceptualized over the years as alternative treatments for current medical
procedures. Most of those applications are applied to various chronic diseases.
This work investigates how synthetically engineered neurons can operate as
digital logic gates that can be used towards bio-computing for the brain. We
quantify the accuracy of logic gates under high firing rates amid a network of
neurons and by how much it can smooth out uncontrolled neuronal firings. To
test the efficacy of our method, simulations composed of computational models
of neurons connected in a structure that represents a logic gate are performed.
The simulations demonstrated the accuracy of performing the correct logic
operation, and how specific properties such as the firing rate can play an
important role in the accuracy. As part of the analysis, the Mean squared error
is used to quantify the quality of our proposed model and predicting the
accurate operation of a gate based on different sampling frequencies. As an
application, the logic gates were used to trap epileptic seizures in a neuronal
network, where the results demonstrated the effectiveness of reducing the
firing rate. Our proposed system has the potential for computing numerous
neurological conditions of the brain.
"
1660,"Population-Induced Phase Transitions and the Verification of Chemical
  Reaction Networks","  We show that very simple molecular systems, modeled as chemical reaction
networks, can have behaviors that exhibit dramatic phase transitions at certain
population thresholds. Moreover, the magnitudes of these thresholds can thwart
attempts to use simulation, model checking, or approximation by differential
equations to formally verify the behaviors of such systems at realistic
populations. We show how formal theorem provers can successfully verify some
such systems at populations where other verification methods fail.
"
1661,"Automated Blood Cell Detection and Counting via Deep Learning for
  Microfluidic Point-of-Care Medical Devices","  Automated in-vitro cell detection and counting have been a key theme for
artificial and intelligent biological analysis such as biopsy, drug analysis
and decease diagnosis. Along with the rapid development of microfluidics and
lab-on-chip technologies, in-vitro live cell analysis has been one of the
critical tasks for both research and industry communities. However, it is a
great challenge to obtain and then predict the precise information of live
cells from numerous microscopic videos and images. In this paper, we
investigated in-vitro detection of white blood cells using deep neural
networks, and discussed how state-of-the-art machine learning techniques could
fulfil the needs of medical diagnosis. The approach we used in this study was
based on Faster Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks (Faster RCNNs), and
a transfer learning process was applied to apply this technique to the
microscopic detection of blood cells. Our experimental results demonstrated
that fast and efficient analysis of blood cells via automated microscopic
imaging can achieve much better accuracy and faster speed than the
conventionally applied methods, implying a promising future of this technology
to be applied to the microfluidic point-of-care medical devices.
"
1662,"Improving Robustness of ReRAM-based Spiking Neural Network Accelerator
  with Stochastic Spike-timing-dependent-plasticity","  Spike-timing-dependent-plasticity (STDP) is an unsupervised learning
algorithm for spiking neural network (SNN), which promises to achieve deeper
understanding of human brain and more powerful artificial intelligence. While
conventional computing system fails to simulate SNN efficiently,
process-in-memory (PIM) based on devices such as ReRAM can be used in designing
fast and efficient STDP based SNN accelerators, as it operates in high
resemblance with biological neural network. However, the real-life
implementation of such design still suffers from impact of input noise and
device variation. In this work, we present a novel stochastic STDP algorithm
that uses spiking frequency information to dynamically adjust synaptic
behavior. The algorithm is tested in pattern recognition task with noisy input
and shows accuracy improvement over deterministic STDP. In addition, we show
that the new algorithm can be used for designing a robust ReRAM based SNN
accelerator that has strong resilience to device variation.

1663,An algorithm for DNA read alignment on quantum accelerators,"  With small-scale quantum processors transitioning from experimental physics
labs to industrial products, these processors allow us to efficiently compute
important algorithms in various fields. In this paper, we propose a quantum
algorithm to address the challenging field of big data processing for genome
sequence reconstruction. This research describes an architecture-aware
implementation of a quantum algorithm for sub-sequence alignment. A new
algorithm named QiBAM (quantum indexed bidirectional associative memory) is
proposed, that uses approximate pattern-matching based on Hamming distances.
QiBAM extends the Grover's search algorithm in two ways to allow for: (1)
approximate matches needed for read errors in genomics, and (2) a distributed
search for multiple solutions over the quantum encoding of DNA sequences. This
approach gives a quadratic speedup over the classical algorithm. A full
implementation of the algorithm is provided and verified using the OpenQL
compiler and QX simulator framework. This represents a first exploration
towards a full-stack quantum accelerated genome sequencing pipeline design. The
open-source implementation can be found on
https://github.com/prince-ph0en1x/QAGS.
"
1664,"A Camera That CNNs: Towards Embedded Neural Networks on Pixel Processor
  Arrays","  We present a convolutional neural network implementation for pixel processor
array (PPA) sensors. PPA hardware consists of a fine-grained array of
general-purpose processing elements, each capable of light capture, data
storage, program execution, and communication with neighboring elements. This
allows images to be stored and manipulated directly at the point of light
capture, rather than having to transfer images to external processing hardware.
Our CNN approach divides this array up into 4x4 blocks of processing elements,
essentially trading-off image resolution for increased local memory capacity
per 4x4 ""pixel"". We implement parallel operations for image addition,
subtraction and bit-shifting images in this 4x4 block format. Using these
components we formulate how to perform ternary weight convolutions upon these
images, compactly store results of such convolutions, perform max-pooling, and
transfer the resulting sub-sampled data to an attached micro-controller. We
train ternary weight filter CNNs for digit recognition and a simple tracking
task, and demonstrate inference of these networks upon the SCAMP5 PPA system.
This work represents a first step towards embedding neural network processing
capability directly onto the focal plane of a sensor.

  Perspective","  Recent developments in nanotechnology herald nanometer-sized devices expected
to bring light to a number of groundbreaking applications. Communication with
and among nanodevices will be needed for unlocking the full potential of such
applications. As the traditional communication approaches cannot be directly
applied in nanocommunication, several alternative paradigms have emerged. Among
them, electromagnetic nanocommunication in the terahertz (THz) frequency band
is particularly promising, mainly due to the breakthrough of novel materials
such as graphene. For this reason, numerous research efforts are nowadays
targeting THz band nanocommunication and consequently nanonetworking. As it is
expected that these trends will continue in the future, we see it beneficial to
summarize the current status in these research domains. In this survey, we
therefore aim to provide an overview of the current THz nanocommunication and
nanonetworking research. Specifically, we discuss the applications envisioned
to be supported by nanonetworks operating in the THz band, together with the
requirements such applications pose on the underlying nanonetworks.
Subsequently, we provide an overview of the current contributions on the
different layers of the protocol stack, as well as the available channel models
and experimentation tools. As the final contribution, we identify a number of
open research challenges and outline several potential future research
directions.

1666,Hybrid Nano Communications,"  In this paper, we propose a hybrid nano communication (HNC) system that
integrates three possible modes of nano communications: terahertz communication
(TC), molecular communication (MC), and neural communication (NC). The paper
provides some insights into how the required four key building blocks, namely,
terahertz to molecular (T2M) relay interface, molecular to terahertz (M2T)
interface, molecular to neural (M2N) relay, and neural to molecular (N2M)
interface can be designed to implement the HNC system. In addition, the
capacity analysis for the hybrid channel is provided. Sub-channels' capacities
are also calculated. Finally, numerical results are presented to comprehend the
data transmission capacity of the proposed HNC system.

1667,Long range battery-less PV-powered RFID tag sensors,"  Communication range in passive Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID)
front-end devices is a critical barrier in the real-world implementation of
this low-cost technology. Purely passive RFID tags power up by harvesting the
limited RF energy transmitted by the interrogator, and communicate by
backscattering the incident signal. This mode of communication keeps
manufacturing costs below a few cents per tag, but the limited power available
at the tag undermines long-range deployment. In this paper, we present an
approach to use Photovoltaics (PV) to augment the available energy at the tag
to improve read range and sensing capabilities. We provide this extra-energy to
the RFID integrated circuit (IC) using minimum additional electronics yet
enabling persistent sensor-data acquisition. Current and emerging thin-film PV
technologies have significant potential for being very low-cost, hence
eliminating the barrier for implementation and making of PV-RFID wireless
sensors. We reduce the long-range PV-RFID idea to practice by creating
functional prototypes of i) a wireless building environment sensor to monitor
temperature, and ii) an embedded tracker to find lost golf balls. The read
range of PV-RFID is enhanced 8 times compared to conventional passive devices.
In addition, the PV-RFID tags persistently transmit large volumes of sensor
data (>0.14 million measurements per day) without using batteries. For
communication range and energy persistence, we observe good agreement between
calculated estimates and experimental results. We have also identified avenues
for future research to develop low-cost PV-RFID devices for wireless sensing in
the midst of the other competitive wireless technologies such as Bluetooth,
Zigbee, Long Range (LoRa) backscatter etc.

  for neuromorphic accelerators","  Magnetic domain walls are information tokens in both logic and memory
devices, and hold particular interest in applications such as neuromorphic
accelerators that combine logic in memory. Here, we show that devices based on
the electrical manipulation of magnetic domain walls are capable of
implementing linear, as well as programmable nonlinear, functions. Unlike other
approaches, domain-wall-based devices are ideal for application to both
synaptic weight generators and thresholding in deep neural networks. Prototype
micrometer-size devices operate with 8 ns current pulses and the energy
consumption required for weight modulation is < 16 pJ. Both speed and energy
consumption compare favorably to other synaptic nonvolatile devices, with the
expected energy dissipation for scaled 20 nm devices close to that of
biological neurons.
"
1669,"Parallel fault-tolerant programming of an arbitrary feedforward photonic
  network","  Reconfigurable photonic mesh networks of tunable beamsplitter nodes can
linearly transform $N$-dimensional vectors representing input modal amplitudes
of light for applications such as energy-efficient machine learning hardware,
quantum information processing, and mode demultiplexing. Such photonic meshes
are typically programmed and/or calibrated by tuning or characterizing each
beam splitter one-by-one, which can be time-consuming and can limit scaling to
larger meshes. Here we introduce a graph-topological approach that defines the
general class of feedforward networks commonly used in such applications and
identifies columns of non-interacting nodes that can be adjusted
simultaneously. By virtue of this approach, we can calculate the necessary
input vectors to program entire columns of nodes in parallel by simultaneously
nullifying the power in one output of each node via optoelectronic feedback
onto adjustable phase shifters or couplers. This parallel nullification
approach is fault-tolerant to fabrication errors, requiring no prior knowledge
or calibration of the node parameters, and can reduce the programming time by a
factor of order $N$ to being proportional to the optical depth (or number of
node columns in the device). As a demonstration, we simulate our programming
protocol on a feedforward optical neural network model trained to classify
handwritten digit images from the MNIST dataset with up to 98% validation
accuracy.

1670,"Committee machines -- a universal method to deal with non-idealities in
  memristor-based neural networks","  Artificial neural networks are notoriously power- and time-consuming when
implemented on conventional von Neumann computing systems. Consequently, recent
years have seen an emergence of research in machine learning hardware that
strives to bring memory and computing closer together. A popular approach is to
realise artificial neural networks in hardware by implementing their synaptic
weights using memristive devices. However, various device- and system-level
non-idealities usually prevent these physical implementations from achieving
high inference accuracy. We suggest applying a well-known concept in computer
science -- committee machines -- in the context of memristor-based neural
networks. Using simulations and experimental data from three different types of
memristive devices, we show that committee machines employing ensemble
averaging can successfully increase inference accuracy in physically
implemented neural networks that suffer from faulty devices, device-to-device
variability, random telegraph noise and line resistance. Importantly, we
demonstrate that the accuracy can be improved even without increasing the total
number of memristors.
"
1671,TiM-DNN: Ternary in-Memory accelerator for Deep Neural Networks,"  The use of lower precision has emerged as a popular technique to optimize the
compute and storage requirements of complex Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). In the
quest for lower precision, recent studies have shown that ternary DNNs (which
represent weights and activations by signed ternary values) represent a
promising sweet spot, achieving accuracy close to full-precision networks on
complex tasks. We propose TiM-DNN, a programmable in-memory accelerator that is
specifically designed to execute ternary DNNs. TiM-DNN supports various ternary
representations including unweighted {-1,0,1}, symmetric weighted {-a,0,a}, and
asymmetric weighted {-a,0,b} ternary systems. The building blocks of TiM-DNN
are TiM tiles -- specialized memory arrays that perform massively parallel
signed ternary vector-matrix multiplications with a single access. TiM tiles
are in turn composed of Ternary Processing Cells (TPCs), bit-cells that
function as both ternary storage units and signed ternary multiplication units.
We evaluate an implementation of TiM-DNN in 32nm technology using an
architectural simulator calibrated with SPICE simulations and RTL synthesis. We
evaluate TiM-DNN across a suite of state-of-the-art DNN benchmarks including
both deep convolutional and recurrent neural networks. A 32-tile instance of
TiM-DNN achieves a peak performance of 114 TOPs/s, consumes 0.9W power, and
occupies 1.96mm2 chip area, representing a 300X and 388X improvement in TOPS/W
and TOPS/mm2, respectively, compared to an NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU. In comparison
to specialized DNN accelerators, TiM-DNN achieves 55X-240X and 160X-291X
improvement in TOPS/W and TOPS/mm2, respectively. Finally, when compared to a
well-optimized near-memory accelerator for ternary DNNs, TiM-DNN demonstrates
3.9x-4.7x improvement in system-level energy and 3.2x-4.2x speedup,
underscoring the potential of in-memory computing for ternary DNNs.
"
1672,"An experimental proof that resistance-switching memories are not
  memristors","  It has been suggested that all resistive-switching memory cells are
memristors. The latter are hypothetical, ideal devices whose resistance, as
originally formulated, depends only on the net charge that traverses them.
Recently, an unambiguous test has been proposed [J. Phys. D: Appl. Phys. {\bf
52}, 01LT01 (2019)] to determine whether a given physical system is indeed a
memristor or not. Here, we experimentally apply such a test to both in-house
fabricated Cu-SiO2 and commercially available electrochemical metallization
cells. Our results unambiguously show that electrochemical metallization memory
cells are not memristors. Since the particular resistance-switching memories
employed in our study share similar features with many other memory cells, our
findings refute the claim that all resistance-switching memories are
memristors. They also cast doubts on the existence of ideal memristors as
actual physical devices that can be fabricated experimentally. Our results then
lead us to formulate two memristor impossibility conjectures regarding the
impossibility of building a model of physical resistance-switching memories
based on the memristor model.
"
1673,"High-Throughput In-Memory Computing for Binary Deep Neural Networks with
  Monolithically Integrated RRAM and 90nm CMOS","  Deep learning hardware designs have been bottlenecked by conventional
memories such as SRAM due to density, leakage and parallel computing
challenges. Resistive devices can address the density and volatility issues,
but have been limited by peripheral circuit integration. In this work, we
demonstrate a scalable RRAM based in-memory computing design, termed XNOR-RRAM,
which is fabricated in a 90nm CMOS technology with monolithic integration of
RRAM devices between metal 1 and 2. We integrated a 128x64 RRAM array with CMOS
peripheral circuits including row/column decoders and flash analog-to-digital
converters (ADCs), which collectively become a core component for scalable
RRAM-based in-memory computing towards large deep neural networks (DNNs). To
maximize the parallelism of in-memory computing, we assert all 128 wordlines of
the RRAM array simultaneously, perform analog computing along the bitlines, and
digitize the bitline voltages using ADCs. The resistance distribution of low
resistance states is tightened by write-verify scheme, and the ADC offset is
calibrated. Prototype chip measurements show that the proposed design achieves
high binary DNN accuracy of 98.5% for MNIST and 83.5% for CIFAR-10 datasets,
respectively, with energy efficiency of 24 TOPS/W and 158 GOPS throughput. This
represents 5.6X, 3.2X, 14.1X improvements in throughput, energy-delay product
(EDP), and energy-delay-squared product (ED2P), respectively, compared to the
state-of-the-art literature. The proposed XNOR-RRAM can enable intelligent
functionalities for area-/energy-constrained edge computing devices.
"
1674,"A Demonstration of Implication Logic Based on Volatile (Diffusive)
  Memristors","  Implication logic gates that are based on volatile memristors are
demonstrated experimentally with the use of relay-based volatile memristor
emulators of an original design. The fabricated logic circuit involves two
volatile memristors and it is capable of performing four fundamental logic
functions (two types of material implication and the negations thereof).
Moreover, current-voltage characteristics of individual emulators are recorded
and self-sustained oscillations in a resistor-volatile memristor circuit are
found. The developed emulator offers a great potential for memristive circuit
experiments because of its simplicity, similarity of response with volatile
memristors, and low cost. Our findings, which are based on emulators, can
easily be reproduced with physical volatile memristors and, thus, open up
possibilities for emerging in-memory computing architectures.
"
1675,"OpticalGAN : Generative Adversarial Networks for Continuous Variable
  Quantum Computation","  We present OpticalGAN, an extension of quantum generative adversarial
networks for continuous-variable quantum computation. OpticalGAN consists of
photonic variational circuits comprising of optical Gaussian and Kerr gates.
Photonic quantum computation is a realization of continuous variable quantum
computing which involves encoding and processing information in the continuous
quadrature amplitudes of quantized electromagnetic field such as light.
Information processing in photonic quantum computers is performed using optical
gates on squeezed light. Both the generator and discriminator of OpticalGAN are
short depth variational circuits composed of gaussian and non-gaussian gates.
We demonstrate our approach by using OpticalGAN to generate energy eigenstates
and coherent states. All of our code is available at

"
1676,Algorithm for Training Neural Networks on Resistive Device Arrays,"  Hardware architectures composed of resistive cross-point device arrays can
provide significant power and speed benefits for deep neural network training
workloads using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and backpropagation (BP)
algorithm. The training accuracy on this imminent analog hardware however
strongly depends on the switching characteristics of the cross-point elements.
One of the key requirements is that these resistive devices must change
conductance in a symmetrical fashion when subjected to positive or negative
pulse stimuli. Here, we present a new training algorithm, so-called the
""Tiki-Taka"" algorithm, that eliminates this stringent symmetry requirement. We
show that device asymmetry introduces an unintentional implicit cost term into
the SGD algorithm, whereas in the ""Tiki-Taka"" algorithm a coupled dynamical
system simultaneously minimizes the original objective function of the neural
network and the unintentional cost term due to device asymmetry in a
self-consistent fashion. We tested the validity of this new algorithm on a
range of network architectures such as fully connected, convolutional and LSTM
networks. Simulation results on these various networks show that whatever
accuracy is achieved using the conventional SGD algorithm with symmetric
(ideal) device switching characteristics the same accuracy is also achieved
using the ""Tiki-Taka"" algorithm with non-symmetric (non-ideal) device switching
characteristics. Moreover, all the operations performed on the arrays are still
parallel and therefore the implementation cost of this new algorithm on array
architectures is minimal; and it maintains the aforementioned power and speed
benefits. These algorithmic improvements are crucial to relax the material
specification and to realize technologically viable resistive crossbar arrays
that outperform digital accelerators for similar training tasks.
"
1677,"Diffusion-Based Molecular Communication Channel in Presence of a
  Probabilistic Absorber: Single Receptor Model and Congestion Analysis","  In this paper, a diffusion-based molecular communication channel is modeled
in presence of a probabilistic absorber. The probabilistic absorber is an
absorber which absorbs molecules upon collision with probability q. With random
walk analysis, the discrete probability function of particle location in the
presence of a probabilistic absorber can be found. Then, a continuous
probability function is fitted to this Markov-based results with introducing
several fitting parameters to the known probability function of particle
location in an unbounded environment without an absorbing barrier. With this
approach, a single receptor is modeled as an M/M/1/1 queue in which q
represents the complementary blocking probability and the mean service time is
the mean trafficking time. Therefore, we are able to model the stochastic
nature of ligand-receptor binding, which comes from the incapability of a
receptor to receive all molecules in its space; and also known as receptor
occupancy. The proper consideration of the absorption effect leads to the
accurate calculation of the concentration at the desired site, which is
definitely less than the concentration obtained when neglecting it. These
findings can have a crucial role in designing drug delivery systems in which
determining the optimal rate of the drug transmitting nanomachines is critical
to avoid toxicity while maintaining effectiveness.
"
1678,"Control of criticality and computation in spiking neuromorphic networks
  with plasticity","  The critical state is assumed to be optimal for any computation in recurrent
neural networks, because criticality maximizes a number of abstract
computational properties. We challenge this assumption by evaluating the
performance of a spiking recurrent neural network on a set of tasks of varying
complexity at - and away from critical network dynamics. To that end, we
developed a spiking network with synaptic plasticity on a neuromorphic chip. We
show that the distance to criticality can be easily adapted by changing the
input strength, and then demonstrate a clear relation between criticality,
task-performance and information-theoretic fingerprint. Whereas the
information-theoretic measures all show that network capacity is maximal at
criticality, this is not the case for performance on specific tasks: Only the
complex, memory-intensive tasks profit from criticality, whereas the simple
tasks suffer from it. Thereby, we challenge the general assumption that
criticality would be beneficial for any task, and provide instead an
understanding of how the collective network state should be tuned to task
requirement to achieve optimal performance.
"
1679,Real-Time Cortical Simulation on Neuromorphic Hardware,"  Real-time simulation of a large-scale biologically representative spiking
neural network is presented, through the use of a heterogeneous parallelisation
scheme and SpiNNaker neuromorphic hardware. A published cortical microcircuit
model is used as a benchmark test case, representing approx. 1 square mm of
early sensory cortex, containing 77k neurons and 0.3 billion synapses. This is
the first true real-time simulation of this model, with 10 s of biological
simulation time executed in 10 s wall-clock time. This surpasses best published
efforts on HPC neural simulators (3x slowdown) and GPUs running optimised SNN
libraries (2x slowdown). Furthermore, the presented approach indicates that
real-time processing can be maintained with increasing SNN size, breaking the
communication barrier incurred by traditional computing machinery. Model
results are compared to an established HPC simulator baseline to verify
simulation correctness, comparing well across a range of statistical measures.
Energy to solution, and energy per synaptic event are also reported,
demonstrating that the relatively low-tech SpiNNaker processors achieve a 10x
reduction in energy relative to modern HPC systems, and comparable energy
consumption to modern GPUs. Finally, system robustness is demonstrated through
multiple 12 h simulations of the cortical microcircuit, each simulating 12 h of
biological time, and demonstrating the potential of neuromorphic hardware as a
neuroscience research tool for studying complex spiking neural networks over
extended time periods.
"
1680,"Simulation Study and Analysis of Diffusive Molecular Communications with
  an Apertured Plane","  Molecular communication via diffusion (MCvD) is a method of achieving nano-
and micro-scale connectivity by utilizing the free diffusion mechanism of
information molecules. The randomness in diffusive propagation is the main
cause of inter-symbol interference (ISI) and the limiting factor of high data
rate MCvD applications. In this paper, an apertured plane is considered between
the transmitter and the receiver of an MCvD link. Either after being
artificially placed or occurring naturally, surfaces or volumes that resemble
an apertured plane only allow a fraction of the molecules to pass. Contrary to
intuition, it is observed that such topology may improve communication
performance, given the molecules that can pass through the aperture are the
ones that take more directed paths towards the receiver. Furthermore, through
both computer simulations and a theoretical signal evaluation metric named
signal-to-interference and noise amplitude ratio (SINAR), it is found that the
size of the aperture imposes a trade-off between the received signal power and
the ISI combating capability of an MCvD system, hinting to an optimal aperture
size that minimizes the bit error rate (BER). It is observed that the trend of
BER is accurately mirrored by SINAR, suggesting the proposed metric's
applicability to optimization tasks in MCvD systems, including finding the
optimal aperture size of an apertured plane. In addition, computer simulations
and SINAR show that said optimal aperture size is affected by the location of
the aperture and the bit rate. Lastly, the paper analyzes the effects of radial
and angular offsets in the placement of the apertured plane, and finds that a
reduction in BER is still in effect up to certain offset values. Overall, our
results imply that apertured plane-like surfaces may actually help
communication efficiency, even though they reduce the received signal power.

"
1682,Modeling and Designing Routing Protocols in Quantum Networks,"  Quantum networks enable a number of important applications such as quantum
key distribution. The basic function of a quantum network is to enable
long-distance quantum entanglement between two remote communication parties.
This work focuses on the entanglement routing problem, whose objective is to
build long-distance entanglements for the concurrent source-destination pairs
through multiple hops. Different from existing works that analyzes the
traditional routing techniques on special network topologies, we present a
comprehensive entanglement routing model that reflects the differences between
quantum networks and classical networks and new entanglement routing algorithms
that utilize the unique properties of quantum networks. Evaluation results show
that the proposed algorithm Q-CAST increases the number of successful
long-distance entanglements by a big margin compared to other methods. The
model and simulator developed by this work may encourage more network
researchers to study the entanglement routing problem.

1683,"Brain-Inspired Hardware for Artificial Intelligence: Accelerated
  Learning in a Physical-Model Spiking Neural Network","  Future developments in artificial intelligence will profit from the existence
of novel, non-traditional substrates for brain-inspired computing. Neuromorphic
computers aim to provide such a substrate that reproduces the brain's
capabilities in terms of adaptive, low-power information processing. We present
results from a prototype chip of the BrainScaleS-2 mixed-signal neuromorphic
system that adopts a physical-model approach with a 1000-fold acceleration of
spiking neural network dynamics relative to biological real time. Using the
embedded plasticity processor, we both simulate the Pong arcade video game and
implement a local plasticity rule that enables reinforcement learning, allowing
the on-chip neural network to learn to play the game. The experiment
demonstrates key aspects of the employed approach, such as accelerated and
flexible learning, high energy efficiency and resilience to noise.
"
1684,Computational Chemistry on Quantum Computers,"  The purpose of this experiment was to use the known analytical techniques to
study the creation, simulation, and measurements of molecular Hamiltonians. The
techniques used consisted of the Linear Combination of Atomic Orbitals (LCAO),
the Linear Combination of Unitaries (LCU), and the Phase Estimation Algorithm
(PEA). The molecules studied were $H_2$ with and without spin, as well as
$He_2$ without spin. Hamiltonians were created under the LCAO basis, and
reconstructed using the Jordan-Winger transform in order to create a linear
combination of Pauli spin operators. The lengths of each molecular Hamiltonian
greatly increased from the $H_2$ without spin, to $He_2$. This resulted in a
reduced ability to simulate the Hamiltonians under ideal conditions. Thus, only
low orders of l = 1 and l = 2 were used when expanding the Hamiltonian in
accordance to the LCU method of simulation. The resulting Hamiltonians were
measured using PEA, and plotted against function of $\frac{2\pi(K)}{N}$ and the
probability distribution of each register. The resolution of the graph was
dependent on the amount of registers, N, being used. However, the reduction of
order hardly changed the image of the $H_2$ graphs. Qualitative comparisons
between the three molecules were drawn.
"
1685,Support Vector Machines on Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum Computers,"  Support vector machine algorithms are considered essential for the
implementation of automation in a radio access network. Specifically, they are
critical in the prediction of the quality of user experience for video
streaming based on device and network-level metrics. Quantum SVM is the quantum
analogue of the classical SVM algorithm, which utilizes the properties of
quantum computers to speed up the algorithm exponentially. In this work, we
derive an optimized preprocessing unit for a quantum SVM that allows
classifying any two-dimensional datasets that are linearly separable. We
further provide a result readout method of the kernel matrix generation circuit
to avoid quantum tomography that, in turn, reduces the quantum circuit depth.
We also derive a quantum SVM system based on an optimized HHL quantum circuit
with reduced circuit depth.
"
1686,K-Means Clustering on Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum Computers,"  Real-time clustering of big performance data generated by the
telecommunication networks requires domain-specific high performance compute
infrastructure to detect anomalies. In this paper, we evaluate noisy
intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers characterized by low decoherence
times, for K-means clustering and propose three strategies to generate
shorter-depth quantum circuits needed to overcome the limitation of NISQ
computers. The strategies are based on exploiting; i) quantum interference, ii)
negative rotations and iii) destructive interference. By comparing our
implementations on IBMQX2 machine for representative data sets, we show that
NISQ computers can solve the K-means clustering problem with the same level of
accuracy as that of classical computers.

  Wang, L. Li, L. Shi, H. Wu, and L. O. Chua [J. Appl. Phys. 125, 054504
  (2019)]","  Wang et al. claim [J. Appl. Phys. 125, 054504 (2019)] that a current-carrying
wire interacting with a magnetic core represents a memristor. Here, we
demonstrate that this claim is false. We first show that such memristor
""discovery"" is based on incorrect physics, which does not even capture basic
properties of magnetic core materials, such as their magnetic hysteresis.
Moreover, the predictions of Wang et al.'s model contradict the experimental
curves presented in their paper. Additionally, the theoretical pinched
hysteresis loops presented by Wang et al. can not be reproduced if their model
is used, and there are serious flaws in their ""negative memristor"" emulator
design. Finally, a simple gedanken experiment shows that the proposed
$\Phi$-memristor would fail the memristor test we recently suggested in J.
Phys. D: Appl. Phys. 52, 01LT01 (2019). The device ""discovered"" by Wang et al.

1688,"Pre- and post-processing in quantum-computational hydrologic inverse
  analysis","  It was recently shown that certain subsurface hydrological inverse problems
-- here framed as determining the composition of an aquifer from pressure
readings -- can be solved on a quantum annealer. However, the quantum annealer
performance suffered when solving problems where the aquifer was composed of
materials with vastly different permeability, which is often encountered in
practice. In this paper, we study why this regime is difficult and use several
pre- and post-processing tools to address these issues. This study has three
benefits: it improves quantum annealing performance for real-world problems in
hydrology, it studies the scaling behavior for these problems (which were
previously studied at a fixed size), and it elucidates a challenging class of
problems that are amenable to quantum annealers.

1689,"Discrete Polynomial Optimization with Coherent Networks of Condensates
  and Complex Coupling Switching","  Gain-dissipative platforms consisting of lasers, optical parametric
oscillators and nonequilibrium condensates operating at the
condensation/coherence threshold have been recently proposed as efficient
analog simulators of 2-local spin Hamiltonians with continuous or discrete
degrees of freedom. We show that nonequilibrium condensates above the threshold
arranged in an interacting network may realise k-local Hamiltonians with k>2
and lead to nontrivial phase configurations. The principle of the operation of
such a system lays the ground for physics-inspired computing and the new
efficient methods for finding solutions to the higher order binary optimization
problems. We show how to facilitate the search for the global solution by
invoking complex couplings in the system and demonstrate the efficiency of the
method on tensors with million entries. This approach offers a highly flexible
new kind of computation based on gain-dissipative simulators with complex
coupling switching. g.

1690,"Generalized DC loop current attack against the KLJN secure key exchange
  scheme","  A new attack against the Kirchhoff Law Johnson Noise (KLJN) secure key
distribution system is studied with unknown parasitic DC voltage sources at
both Alices and Bobs ends. This paper is the generalization of our earlier
investigation with a single end parasitic source. Under the assumption that Eve
does not know the values of the parasitic sources, a new attack, utilizing the
current generated by the parasitic dc voltage sources, is introduced. The
attack is mathematically analyzed and demonstrated by computer simulations.
Simple defense methods against the attack are shown. The earlier defense method
based solely on the comparison of current/voltage data at Alice's and Bob's
terminals is useless here since the wire currents and voltages are equal at
both ends. However, the more expensive version of the earlier defense method,
which is based on in situ system simulation and comparison with measurements,
works efficiently.

1692,Implementing Grover oracles for quantum key search on AES and LowMC,"  Grover's search algorithm gives a quantum attack against block ciphers by
searching for a key that matches a small number of plaintext-ciphertext pairs.
This attack uses $O(\sqrt{N})$ calls to the cipher to search a key space of
size $N$. Previous work in the specific case of AES derived the full gate cost
by analyzing quantum circuits for the cipher, but focused on minimizing the
number of qubits. In contrast, we study the cost of quantum key search attacks
under a depth restriction and introduce techniques that reduce the oracle
depth, even if it requires more qubits. As cases in point, we design quantum
circuits for the block ciphers AES and LowMC. Our circuits give a lower overall
attack cost in both the gate count and depth-times-width cost models. In NIST's
post-quantum cryptography standardization process, security categories are
defined based on the concrete cost of quantum key search against AES. We
present new, lower cost estimates for each category, so our work has immediate
implications for the security assessment of post-quantum cryptography. As part
of this work, we release Q# implementations of the full Grover oracle for
AES-128, -192, -256 and for the three LowMC instantiations used in Picnic,
including unit tests and code to reproduce our quantum resource estimates. To
the best of our knowledge, these are the first two such full implementations

1693,A Novel Low Power Non-Volatile SRAM Cell with Self Write Termination,"  A non-volatile SRAM cell is proposed for low power applications using Spin
Transfer Torque-Magnetic Tunnel Junction (STT-MTJ) devices. This novel cell
offers non-volatile storage, thus allowing selected blocks of SRAM to be
switched off during standby operation. To further increase the power savings, a
write termination circuit is designed which detects completion of MTJ write and
closes the bidirectional current path for the MTJ. A reduction of 25.81% in the
number of transistors and a reduction of 2.95% in the power consumption is
achieved in comparison to prior work on write termination circuits.

1694,"On the Effects of Pseudo and Quantum Random Number Generators in Soft
  Computing","  In this work, we argue that the implications of Pseudo and Quantum Random
Number Generators (PRNG and QRNG) inexplicably affect the performances and
behaviours of various machine learning models that require a random input.
These implications are yet to be explored in Soft Computing until this work. We
use a CPU and a QPU to generate random numbers for multiple Machine Learning
techniques. Random numbers are employed in the random initial weight
distributions of Dense and Convolutional Neural Networks, in which results show
a profound difference in learning patterns for the two. In 50 Dense Neural
Networks (25 PRNG/25 QRNG), QRNG increases over PRNG for accent classification
at +0.1%, and QRNG exceeded PRNG for mental state EEG classification by +2.82%.
In 50 Convolutional Neural Networks (25 PRNG/25 QRNG), the MNIST and CIFAR-10
problems are benchmarked, in MNIST the QRNG experiences a higher starting
accuracy than the PRNG but ultimately only exceeds it by 0.02%. In CIFAR-10,
the QRNG outperforms PRNG by +0.92%. The n-random split of a Random Tree is
enhanced towards and new Quantum Random Tree (QRT) model, which has differing
classification abilities to its classical counterpart, 200 trees are trained
and compared (100 PRNG/100 QRNG). Using the accent and EEG classification
datasets, a QRT seemed inferior to a RT as it performed on average worse by
-0.12%. This pattern is also seen in the EEG classification problem, where a
QRT performs worse than a RT by -0.28%. Finally, the QRT is ensembled into a
Quantum Random Forest (QRF), which also has a noticeable effect when compared
to the standard Random Forest (RF)... ABSTRACT SHORTENED DUE TO ARXIV LIMIT

1695,Metastability-Resilient Synchronization FIFO for SFQ Logic,"  Digital single-flux quantum (SFQ) technology promises to meet the demands of
ultra low power and high speed computing needed for future exascale
supercomputing systems. The combination of ultra high clock frequencies,
gate-level pipelines, and numerous sources of variability in SFQ circuits,
however, make low-skew global clock distribution a challenge. This motivates
the support of multiple independent clock domains and related clock domain
crossing circuits that enable reliable communication across domains. Existing
J-SIM simulation models indicate that setup violations can cause clock-to-Q
increases of up to 100%. This paper first shows that naive SFQ clock domain
crossing (CDC) first-in-first-out buffers (FIFOs) are vulnerable to these delay
increases, motivating the need for more robust CDC FIFOs. Inspired by CMOS
multi-flip-flop asynchronous FIFO synchronizers, we then propose a novel 1-bit
metastability-resilient SFQ CDC FIFO that simulations show delivers over a 1000
reduction in logical error rate at 30 GHz. Moreover, for a 10-stage FIFO, the
Josephson junction (JJ) area of our proposed design is only 7.5% larger than
the non-resilient counterpart. Finally, we propose design guidelines that
define the minimal FIFO depth subject to both throughput and burstiness
constraints.
"
1696,Threshold Logic in a Flash,"  This paper describes a novel design of a threshold logic gate (a binary
perceptron) and its implementation as a standard cell. This new cell structure,
referred to as flash threshold logic (FTL), uses floating gate (flash)
transistors to realize the weights associated with a threshold function. The
threshold voltages of the flash transistors serve as a proxy for the weights.
An FTL cell can be equivalently viewed as a multi-input, edge-triggered
flipflop which computes a threshold function on a clock edge. Consequently, it
can be used in the automatic synthesis of ASICs. The use of flash transistors
in the FTL cell allows programming of the weights after fabrication, thereby
preventing discovery of its function by a foundry or by reverse engineering.
This paper focuses on the design and characteristics of the FTL cell. We
present a novel method for programming the weights of an FTL cell for a
specified threshold function using a modified perceptron learning algorithm.
The algorithm is further extended to select weights to maximize the robustness
of the design in the presence of process variations. The FTL circuit was
designed in 40nm technology and simulations with layout-extracted parasitics
included, demonstrate significant improvements in the area (79.7%), power
(61.1%), and performance (42.5%) when compared to the equivalent
implementations of the same function in conventional static CMOS design. Weight
selection targeting robustness is demonstrated using Monte Carlo simulations.
The paper also shows how FTL cells can be used for fixing timing errors after
fabrication.

computers such as commercialized by D-Wave when confronted to instances of the
maximum cardinality matching problem specifically designed to be hard to solve
by means of simulated annealing. We benchmark a D-Wave ""Washington"" (2X) with
1098 operational qubits on various sizes of such instances and observe that for
all but the most trivially small of these it fails to obtain an optimal
solution. Thus, our results suggests that quantum annealing, at least as
implemented in a D-Wave device, falls in the same pitfalls as simulated
annealing and therefore suggest that there exist polynomial-time problems that
such a machine cannot solve efficiently to optimality.

1698,Molecular and DNA Artificial Neural Networks via Fractional Coding,"  This paper considers implementation of artificial neural networks (ANNs)
using molecular computing and DNA based on fractional coding. Prior work had
addressed molecular two-layer ANNs with binary inputs and arbitrary weights. In
prior work using fractional coding, a simple molecular perceptron that computes
sigmoid of scaled weighted sum of the inputs was presented where the inputs and
the weights lie between [-1, 1]. Even for computing the perceptron, the prior
approach suffers from two major limitations. First, it cannot compute the
sigmoid of the weighted sum, but only the sigmoid of the scaled weighted sum.
Second, many machine learning applications require the coefficients to be
arbitrarily positive and negative numbers that are not bounded between [-1, 1];
such numbers cannot be handled by the prior perceptron using fractional coding.
This paper makes four contributions. First molecular perceptrons that can
handle arbitrary weights and can compute sigmoid of the weighted sums are
presented. Thus, these molecular perceptrons are ideal for regression
applications and multi-layer ANNs. A new molecular divider is introduced and is
used to compute sigmoid(ax) where a > 1. Second, based on fractional coding, a
molecular artificial neural network (ANN) with one hidden layer is presented.
Third, a trained ANN classifier with one hidden layer from seizure prediction
application from electroencephalogram is mapped to molecular reactions and DNA
and their performances are presented. Fourth, molecular activation functions
for rectified linear unit (ReLU) and softmax are also presented.
"
1699,Variation-aware Binarized Memristive Networks,"  The quantization of weights to binary states in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs)
can replace resource-hungry multiply accumulate operations with simple
accumulations. Such Binarized Neural Networks (BNNs) exhibit greatly reduced
resource and power requirements. In addition, memristors have been shown as
promising synaptic weight elements in DNNs. In this paper, we propose and
simulate novel Binarized Memristive Convolutional Neural Network (BMCNN)
architectures employing hybrid weight and parameter representations. We train
the proposed architectures offline and then map the trained parameters to our
binarized memristive devices for inference. To take into account the variations
in memristive devices, and to study their effect on the performance, we
introduce variations in $R_{ON}$ and $R_{OFF}$. Moreover, we introduce means to
mitigate the adverse effect of memristive variations in our proposed networks.
Finally, we benchmark our BMCNNs and variation-aware BMCNNs using the MNIST
dataset.
"
1700,Error-triggered Three-Factor Learning Dynamics for Crossbar Arrays,"  Recent breakthroughs suggest that local, approximate gradient descent
learning is compatible with Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). Although SNNs can
be scalably implemented using neuromorphic VLSI, an architecture that can learn
in-situ as accurately as conventional processors is still missing. Here, we
propose a subthreshold circuit architecture designed through insights obtained
from machine learning and computational neuroscience that could achieve such
accuracy. Using a surrogate gradient learning framework, we derive local,
error-triggered learning dynamics compatible with crossbar arrays and the
temporal dynamics of SNNs. The derivation reveals that circuits used for
inference and training dynamics can be shared, which simplifies the circuit and
suppresses the effects of fabrication mismatch. We present SPICE simulations on
XFAB 180nm process, as well as large-scale simulations of the spiking neural
networks on event-based benchmarks, including a gesture recognition task. Our
results show that the number of updates can be reduced hundred-fold compared to
the standard rule while achieving performances that are on par with the
state-of-the-art.
"
1701,Probabilistic Circuits for Autonomous Learning: A simulation study,"  Modern machine learning is based on powerful algorithms running on digital
computing platforms and there is great interest in accelerating the learning
process and making it more energy efficient. In this paper we present a fully
autonomous probabilistic circuit for fast and efficient learning that makes no
use of digital computing. Specifically we use SPICE simulations to demonstrate
a clockless autonomous circuit where the required synaptic weights are read out
in the form of analog voltages. Such autonomous circuits could be particularly
of interest as standalone learning devices in the context of mobile and edge
computing.
"
1702,"Continuous Phase Modulation With Faster-than-Nyquist Signaling for
  Channels With 1-bit Quantization and Oversampling at the Receiver","  Continuous phase modulation (CPM) with 1-bit quantization at the receiver is
promising in terms of energy and spectral efficiency. In this study, CPM
waveforms with symbol durations significantly shorter than the inverse of the
signal bandwidth are proposed, termed faster-than-Nyquist CPM. This
configuration provides a better steering of zero-crossings as compared to
conventional CPM. Numerical results confirm a superior performance in terms of
BER in comparison with state-of-the-art methods, while having the same spectral
efficiency and a lower oversampling factor. Moreover, the new waveform can be
detected with low-complexity, which yields almost the same performance as using
the BCJR algorithm.
"
1703,"An Evolutionary Approach to Optimizing Communication Cost in Distributed
  Quantum Computation","  Distributed quantum computing has been well-known for many years as a system
composed of a number of small-capacity quantum circuits. Limitations in the
capacity of monolithic quantum computing systems can be overcome by using
distributed quantum systems which communicate with each other through known
communication links. In our previous study, an algorithm with an exponential
complexity was proposed to optimize the number of qubit teleportations required
for the communications between two partitions of a distributed quantum circuit.
In this work, a genetic algorithm is used to solve the optimization problem in
a more efficient way. The results are compared with the previous study and we
show that our approach works almost the same with a remarkable speed-up.
Moreover, the comparison of the proposed approach based on GA with a random
search over the search space verifies the effectiveness of GA.
"
1704,"Parameter Optimization and Learning in a Spiking Neural Network for UAV
  Obstacle Avoidance targeting Neuromorphic Processors","  The Lobula Giant Movement Detector (LGMD) is an identified neuron of the
locust that detects looming objects and triggers the insect's escape responses.
Understanding the neural principles and network structure that lead to these
fast and robust responses can facilitate the design of efficient obstacle
avoidance strategies for robotic applications. Here we present a neuromorphic
spiking neural network model of the LGMD driven by the output of a neuromorphic
Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS), which incorporates spiking frequency adaptation
and synaptic plasticity mechanisms, and which can be mapped onto existing
neuromorphic processor chips. However, as the model has a wide range of
parameters, and the mixed signal analogue-digital circuits used to implement
the model are affected by variability and noise, it is necessary to optimise
the parameters to produce robust and reliable responses. Here we propose to use
Differential Evolution (DE) and Bayesian Optimisation (BO) techniques to
optimise the parameter space and investigate the use of Self-Adaptive
Differential Evolution (SADE) to ameliorate the difficulties of finding
appropriate input parameters for the DE technique. We quantify the performance
of the methods proposed with a comprehensive comparison of different optimisers
applied to the model, and demonstrate the validity of the approach proposed
using recordings made from a DVS sensor mounted on a UAV.
"
1705,Flying Unicorn: Developing a Game for a Quantum Computer,"  What is it like to create a game for a quantum computer? With its ability to
perform calculations and processing in a distinctly different way than
classical computers, quantum computing has the potential for becoming the next
revolution in information technology. Flying Unicorn is a game developed for a
quantum computer. It is designed to explore the properties of superposition and
uncertainty. In this paper, we explore the development of the game, using
Python Qiskit. We detail the usage of qubits and an implementation of Grover's
search. Finally, we compare and contrast a classical implementation of the game
against the quantum computing design, including execution and performance on a
physical quantum computer at IBMQ.
"
1706,"A Pulse Width Modulation based Power-elastic and Robust Mixed-signal
  Perceptron Design","  Neural networks are exerting burgeoning influence in emerging artificial
intelligence applications at the micro-edge, such as sensing systems and image
processing. As many of these systems are typically self-powered, their circuits
are expected to be resilient and efficient in the presence of continuous power
variations caused by the harvesters.
  In this paper, we propose a novel mixed-signal (i.e. analogue/digital)
approach of designing a power-elastic perceptron using the principle of pulse
width modulation (PWM). Fundamental to the design are a number of parallel
inverters that transcode the input-weight pairs based on the principle of PWM
duty cycle. Since PWM-based inverters are typically agnostic to amplitude and
frequency variations, the perceptron shows a high degree of power elasticity
and robustness under these variations. We show extensive design analysis in
Cadence Analog Design Environment tool using a 3x3 perceptron circuit as a case
study to demonstrate the resilience in the presence of parameric variations.
"
1707,"A Single-MOSFET MAC for Confidence and Resolution (CORE) Driven Machine
  Learning Classification","  Mixed-signal machine-learning classification has recently been demonstrated
as an efficient alternative for classification with power expensive digital
circuits. In this paper, a high-COnfidence high-REsolution (CORE) mixed-signal
classifier is proposed for classifying high-dimensional input data into
multi-class output space with less power and area than state-of-the-art
classifiers. A high-resolution multiplication is facilitated within a
single-MOSFET by feeding the features and feature weights into, respectively,
the body and gate inputs. High-resolution classifier that considers the
confidence of the individual predictors is designed at 45 nm technology node
and operates at 100 MHz in subthreshold region. To evaluate the performance of
the classifier, a reduced MNIST dataset is generated by downsampling the MNIST
digit images from 28 $\times$ 28 features to 9 $\times$ 9 features. The system
is simulated across a wide range of PVT variations, exhibiting nominal accuracy
of 90%, energy consumption of 6.2 pJ per classification (over 45 times lower
than state-of-the-art classifiers), area of 2,179 $\mu$$m^{2}$ (over 7.3 times
lower than state-of-the-art classifiers), and a stable response under PVT
variations.
"
1708,"Kernel computations from large-scale random features obtained by Optical
  Processing Units","  Approximating kernel functions with random features (RFs)has been a
successful application of random projections for nonparametric estimation.
However, performing random projections presents computational challenges for
large-scale problems. Recently, a new optical hardware called Optical
Processing Unit (OPU) has been developed for fast and energy-efficient
computation of large-scale RFs in the analog domain. More specifically, the OPU
performs the multiplication of input vectors by a large random matrix with
complex-valued i.i.d. Gaussian entries, followed by the application of an
element-wise squared absolute value operation - this last nonlinearity being
intrinsic to the sensing process. In this paper, we show that this operation
results in a dot-product kernel that has connections to the polynomial kernel,
and we extend this computation to arbitrary powers of the feature map.
Experiments demonstrate that the OPU kernel and its RF approximation achieve
competitive performance in applications using kernel ridge regression and
transfer learning for image classification. Crucially, thanks to the use of the
OPU, these results are obtained with time and energy savings.
"
1709,"Convolution Inference via Synchronization of a Coupled CMOS Oscillator
  Array","  Oscillator neural networks (ONN) are a promising hardware option for
artificial intelligence. With an abundance of theoretical treatments of ONNs,
few experimental implementations exist to date. In contrast to prior
publications of only building block functionality, we report a practical
experimental demonstration of neural computing using an ONN. The arrays contain
26 CMOS ring oscillators in the GHz range of frequencies tuned by image data
and filters. Synchronization of oscillators results in an analog output voltage
approximating convolution neural network operation.
"
1710,"A Coupled CMOS Oscillator Array for 8ns and 55pJ Inference in
  Convolutional Neural Networks","  Oscillator neural networks (ONN) based on arrays of 26 CMOS ring oscillators
designed and fabricated. ONN are used for inference of dot products with image
fragments and kernels necessary for convolutional neural networks. The inputs
are encoded as frequency shifts of oscillators using current DACs. Degree of
match (DOM) is determined from oscillators synchronization. Measurements
demonstrate high correlation of DOM and dot products. Inference requires the
time of 8ns and energy of 55pJ.
"
1711,"Channel Impulse Analysis of Light Propagation for Point-to-point Nano
  Communications through Cortical Neurons","  Recent Brain-Machine Interfaces have shifted towards miniature devices that
are constructed from nanoscale components. While these devices can be implanted
into the brain, their functionalities can be limited, and will require
communication and networking to enable cooperation. One form of communication
for neuron stimulation is the use of light. A number of considerations needs to
be taken into account for the propagation and this includes diffraction,
scattering, absorption, as well as attenuation. These properties are not only
affected by the medium, but also by the cell's geometric shape. These factor
affects both the direction and amplitude of the light wave. This paper analyzes
the propagation path loss and geometrical gain, channel impulse and frequency
response for light propagation along the neural tissue. The total attenuation
depends on the propagation medium loss and geometrical gain, and the channel
response is highly dependent on the quantity of cells along the path.
Additionally, the optical properties of the medium also impacts on the time
delay at the receiver and the width the location of the detectors. Based on the
numerical analysis, spherical cells attenuate approximately 20% of the
transmitted power, which is less than the fusiform and pyramidal cells (35% and
65%, respectively).
"
1712,"Towards Deep Physical Reservoir Computing Through Automatic Task
  Decomposition And Mapping","  Photonic reservoir computing is a promising candidate for low-energy
computing at high bandwidths. Despite recent successes, there are bounds to
what one can achieve simply by making photonic reservoirs larger. Therefore, a
switch from single-reservoir computing to multi-reservoir and even deep
physical reservoir computing is desirable. Given that backpropagation can not
be used directly to train multi-reservoir systems in our targeted setting, we
propose an alternative approach that still uses its power to derive
intermediate targets. In this work we report our findings on a conducted
experiment to evaluate the general feasibility of our approach by training a
network of 3 Echo State Networks to perform the well-known NARMA-10 task using
targets derived through backpropagation. Our results indicate that our proposed
method is well-suited to train multi-reservoir systems in a efficient way.
"
1713,Training DNN IoT Applications for Deployment On Analog NVM Crossbars,"  A trend towards energy-efficiency, security and privacy has led to a recent
focus on deploying DNNs on microcontrollers. However, limits on compute and
memory resources restrict the size and the complexity of the ML models
deployable in these systems. Computation-In-Memory architectures based on
resistive nonvolatile memory (NVM) technologies hold great promise of
satisfying the compute and memory demands of high-performance and low-power,
inherent in modern DNNs. Nevertheless, these technologies are still immature
and suffer from both the intrinsic analog-domain noise problems and the
inability of representing negative weights in the NVM structures, incurring in
larger crossbar sizes with concomitant impact on ADCs and DACs. In this paper,
we provide a training framework for addressing these challenges and
quantitatively evaluate the circuit-level efficiency gains thus accrued. We
make two contributions: Firstly, we propose a training algorithm that
eliminates the need for tuning individual layers of a DNN ensuring uniformity
across layer weights and activations. This ensures analog-blocks that can be
reused and peripheral hardware substantially reduced. Secondly, using NAS
methods, we propose the use of unipolar-weighted (either all-positive or
all-negative weights) matrices/sub-matrices. Weight unipolarity obviates the
need for doubling crossbar area leading to simplified analog periphery. We
validate our methodology with CIFAR10 and HAR applications by mapping to
crossbars using 4-bit and 2-bit devices. We achieve up to 92:91% accuracy (95%
floating-point) using 2-bit only-positive weights for HAR. A combination of the
proposed techniques leads to 80% area improvement and up to 45% energy
reduction.
"
1714,"Spherical Diffusion Model with Semi-Permeable Boundary: A Transfer
  Function Approach","  The derivation of suitable analytical models is an important step for the
design and analysis of molecular communication systems. However, many existing
models have limited applicability in practical scenarios due to various
simplifications (e.g., assumption of an unbounded environment). In this paper,
we develop a realistic model for particle diffusion in a bounded sphere and
particle transport through a semi-permeable boundary. This model can be used
for various applications, such as modeling of inter-/intra-cell communication
or the release process of drug carriers. The proposed analytical model is based
on a transfer function approach, which allows for fast numerical evaluation and
provides insights into the impact of the relevant molecular communication
system parameters. The proposed solution of the bounded spherical diffusion
problem is formulated in terms of a state-space description and the
semi-permeable boundary is accounted for by a feedback loop. Particle-based
simulations verify the proposed modeling approach.
"
1715,"Hybrid Beamforming for Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface based
  Multi-user Communications: Achievable Rates with Limited Discrete Phase
  Shifts","  Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has drawn considerable attention
from the research society recently, which creates favorable propagation
conditions by controlling the phase shifts of the reflected waves at the
surface, thereby enhancing wireless transmissions. In this paper, we study a
downlink multi-user system where the transmission from a multi-antenna base
station (BS) to various users is achieved by the RIS reflecting the incident
signals of the BS towards the users. Unlike most existing works, we consider
the practical case where only a limited number of discrete phase shifts can be
realized by the finite-sized RIS. Based on the reflection-dominated one-hop
propagation model between the BS and users via the RIS, a hybrid beamforming
scheme is proposed and the sum-rate maximization problem is formulated.
Specifically, the continuous digital beamforming and discrete RIS-based analog
beamforming are performed at the BS and the RIS, respectively, and an iterative
algorithm is designed to solve this problem. Both theoretical analysis and
numerical validations show that the RIS-based system can achieve a good
sum-rate performance by setting a reasonable size of RIS and a small number of
discrete phase shifts.
"
1716,Method to Characterize Potential UAS Encounters Using Open Source Data,"  As unmanned aerial systems (UASs) increasingly integrate into the US national
airspace system, there is an increasing need to characterize how commercial and
recreational UASs may encounter each other. To inform the development and
evaluation of safety critical technologies, we demonstrate a methodology to
analytically calculate all potential relative geometries between different UAS
operations performing inspection missions. This method is based on a previously
demonstrated technique that leverages open source geospatial information to
generate representative unmanned aircraft trajectories. Using open source data
and parallel processing techniques, we performed trillions of calculations to
estimate the relative horizontal distance between geospatial points across
sixteen locations.
"
1717,"Channel Characterization for 1D Molecular Communication with Two
  Absorbing Receivers","  This letter develops a one-dimensional (1D) diffusion-based molecular
communication system to analyze channel responses between a single transmitter
(TX) and two fully-absorbing receivers (RXs). Incorporating molecular
degradation in the environment, rigorous analytical formulas for i) the
fraction of molecules absorbed, ii) the corresponding hitting rate, and iii)
the asymptotic fraction of absorbed molecules as time approaches infinity at
each RX are derived when an impulse of molecules are released at the TX. By
using particle-based simulations, the derived analytical expressions are
validated. Simulations also present the distance ranges of two RXs that do not
impact molecular absorption of each other, and demonstrate that the mutual
imfluence of two active RXs reduces with the increase in the degradation rate.
"
1718,"A Framework to Explore Workload-Specific Performance and Lifetime
  Trade-offs in Neuromorphic Computing","  Neuromorphic hardware with non-volatile memory (NVM) can implement machine
learning workload in an energy-efficient manner. Unfortunately, certain NVMs
such as phase change memory (PCM) require high voltages for correct operation.
These voltages are supplied from an on-chip charge pump. If the charge pump is
activated too frequently, its internal CMOS devices do not recover from stress,
accelerating their aging and leading to negative bias temperature instability
(NBTI) generated defects. Forcefully discharging the stressed charge pump can
lower the aging rate of its CMOS devices, but makes the neuromorphic hardware
unavailable to perform computations while its charge pump is being discharged.
This negatively impacts performance such as latency and accuracy of the machine
learning workload being executed. In this paper, we propose a novel framework
to exploit workload-specific performance and lifetime trade-offs in
neuromorphic computing. Our framework first extracts the precise times at which
a charge pump in the hardware is activated to support neural computations
within a workload. This timing information is then used with a characterized
NBTI reliability model to estimate the charge pump's aging during the workload
execution. We use our framework to evaluate workload-specific performance and
reliability impacts of using 1) different SNN mapping strategies and 2)
different charge pump discharge strategies. We show that our framework can be
used by system designers to explore performance and reliability trade-offs
early in the design of neuromorphic hardware such that appropriate
reliability-oriented design margins can be set.
"
1719,Quantum Algorithms for Deep Convolutional Neural Networks,"  Quantum computing is a new computational paradigm that promises applications
in several fields, including machine learning. In the last decade, deep
learning, and in particular Convolutional neural networks (CNN), have become
essential for applications in signal processing and image recognition. Quantum
deep learning, however remains a challenging problem, as it is difficult to
implement non linearities with quantum unitaries. In this paper we propose a
quantum algorithm for applying and training deep convolutional neural networks
with a potential speedup. The quantum CNN (QCNN) is a shallow circuit,
reproducing completely the classical CNN, by allowing non linearities and
pooling operations. The QCNN is particularly interesting for deep networks and
could allow new frontiers in image recognition, by using more or larger
convolution kernels, larger or deeper inputs. We introduce a new quantum
tomography algorithm with $\ell_{\infty}$ norm guarantees, and new applications
of probabilistic sampling in the context of information processing. We also
present numerical simulations for the classification of the MNIST dataset to
provide practical evidence for the efficiency of the QCNN.
"
1720,Thermodynamic Computing,"  The hardware and software foundations laid in the first half of the 20th
Century enabled the computing technologies that have transformed the world, but
these foundations are now under siege. The current computing paradigm, which is
the foundation of much of the current standards of living that we now enjoy,
faces fundamental limitations that are evident from several perspectives. In
terms of hardware, devices have become so small that we are struggling to
eliminate the effects of thermodynamic fluctuations, which are unavoidable at
the nanometer scale. In terms of software, our ability to imagine and program
effective computational abstractions and implementations are clearly challenged
in complex domains. In terms of systems, currently five percent of the power
generated in the US is used to run computing systems - this astonishing figure
is neither ecologically sustainable nor economically scalable. Economically,
the cost of building next-generation semiconductor fabrication plants has
soared past $10 billion. All of these difficulties - device scaling, software
complexity, adaptability, energy consumption, and fabrication economics -
indicate that the current computing paradigm has matured and that continued
improvements along this path will be limited. If technological progress is to
continue and corresponding social and economic benefits are to continue to
accrue, computing must become much more capable, energy efficient, and
affordable. We propose that progress in computing can continue under a united,
physically grounded, computational paradigm centered on thermodynamics. Herein
we propose a research agenda to extend these thermodynamic foundations into
complex, non-equilibrium, self-organizing systems and apply them holistically
to future computing systems that will harness nature's innate computational
capacity. We call this type of computing ""Thermodynamic Computing"" or TC.
"
1721,"SpiNNaker 2: A 10 Million Core Processor System for Brain Simulation and
  Machine Learning","  SpiNNaker is an ARM-based processor platform optimized for the simulation of
spiking neural networks. This brief describes the roadmap in going from the
current SPINNaker1 system, a 1 Million core machine in 130nm CMOS, to
SpiNNaker2, a 10 Million core machine in 22nm FDSOI. Apart from pure scaling,
we will take advantage of specific technology features, such as runtime
adaptive body biasing, to deliver cutting-edge power consumption. Power
management of the cores allows a wide range of workload adaptivity, i.e.
processor power scales with the complexity and activity of the spiking network.
Additional numerical accelerators will enhance the utility of SpiNNaker2 for
simulation of spiking neural networks as well as for executing conventional
deep neural networks. These measures should increase the simulation capacity of
the machine by a factor $>$50. The interplay between the two domains, i.e.
spiking and rate based, will provide an interesting field for algorithm
exploration on SpiNNaker2. Apart from the platforms' traditional usage as a
neuroscience exploration tool, the extended functionality opens up new
application areas such as automotive AI, tactile internet, industry 4.0 and
biomedical processing.
"
1722,"The non-capacitor model of leaky integrate-and-fire $VO_2$ neuron with
  the thermal mechanism of the membrane potential","  The study presents a numerical model of leaky integrate-and-fire neuron
created on the basis of $VO_2$ switch. The analogue of the membrane potential
in the model is the temperature of the switch channel, and the action potential
from neighbouring neurons propagates along the substrate in the form of thermal
pulses. We simulated the operation of three neurons and demonstrated that the
total effect happens due to interference of thermal waves in the region of the
neuron switching channel. The thermal mechanism of the threshold function
operates due to the effect of electrical switching, and the magnitude
(temperature) of the threshold can vary by external voltage. The neuron circuit
does not contain capacitor, making it possible to produce a network with a high
density of components, and has the potential for 3D integration due to the
thermal mechanism of neurons interaction.
"
1723,Polaritonic neuromorphic computing outperforms linear classifiers,"  Machine learning software applications are nowadays ubiquitous in many fields
of science and society for their outstanding capability of solving
computationally vast problems like the recognition of patterns and regularities
in big datasets. One of the main goals of research is the realization of a
physical neural network able to perform data processing in a much faster and
energy-efficient way than the state-of-the-art technology. Here we show that
lattices of exciton-polariton condensates accomplish neuromorphic computing
using fast optical nonlinearities and with lower error rate than any previous
hardware implementation. We demonstrate that our neural network significantly
increases the recognition efficiency compared to the linear classification
algorithms on one of the most widely used benchmarks, the MNIST problem,
showing a concrete advantage from the integration of optical systems in
reservoir computing architectures.
"
1724,"Scaling advantage in quantum simulation of geometrically frustrated
  magnets","  The promise of quantum computing lies in harnessing programmable quantum
devices for practical applications such as efficient simulation of quantum
materials and condensed matter systems. One important task is the simulation of
geometrically frustrated magnets in which topological phenomena can emerge from
competition between quantum and thermal fluctuations. Here we report on
experimental observations of relaxation in such simulations, measured on up to
1440 qubits with microsecond resolution. By initializing the system in a state
with topological obstruction, we observe quantum annealing (QA) relaxation
timescales in excess of one microsecond. Measurements indicate a dynamical
advantage in the quantum simulation over the classical approach of
path-integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) fixed-Hamiltonian relaxation with multiqubit
cluster updates. The advantage increases with both system size and inverse
temperature, exceeding a million-fold speedup over a CPU. This is an important
piece of experimental evidence that in general, PIMC does not mimic QA dynamics
for stoquastic Hamiltonians. The observed scaling advantage, for simulation of
frustrated magnetism in quantum condensed matter, demonstrates that near-term
quantum devices can be used to accelerate computational tasks of practical
relevance.
"
1725,All-Spin Bayesian Neural Networks,"  Probabilistic machine learning enabled by the Bayesian formulation has
recently gained significant attention in the domain of automated reasoning and
decision-making. While impressive strides have been made recently to scale up
the performance of deep Bayesian neural networks, they have been primarily
standalone software efforts without any regard to the underlying hardware
implementation. In this paper, we propose an ""All-Spin"" Bayesian Neural Network
where the underlying spintronic hardware provides a better match to the
Bayesian computing models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
exploration of a Bayesian neural hardware accelerator enabled by emerging
post-CMOS technologies. We develop an experimentally calibrated
device-circuit-algorithm co-simulation framework and demonstrate $24\times$
reduction in energy consumption against an iso-network CMOS baseline
implementation.
"
1726,Reversible Hardware for Acoustic Communications,"  Reversible computation has been recognised as a potential solution to the
technological bottleneck in the future of computing machinery. Rolf Landauer
determined the lower limit for power dissipation in computation and noted that
dissipation happens when information is lost, i.e., when a bit is erased. This
meant that reversible computation, conserving information conserves energy as
well, and as such can operate on arbitrarily small power. There were only a few
applications and use cases of reversible computing hardware. Here we present a
novel reversible computation architecture for time reversal of waves, with an
application to sound wave communications. This energy efficient design is also
a natural one, and it allows the use of the same hardware for transmission and
reception at the time reversal mirror.
"
1727,Capacitorless Model of a VO2 Oscillator,"  We implement a capacitorless model of a VO2 oscillator by introducing into
the circuit of a field-effect transistor and a VO2 thermal sensor, which
provide negative current feedback with a time delay. We compare the dynamics of
current and voltage oscillations on a switch in a circuit with a capacitor and
without a capacitor. The oscillation period in the capacitorless model is
controlled in a narrow range by changing the distance between the switch and
the sensor. The capacitorless model provides the possibility of significant
miniaturization of the oscillator circuit, and it is important for the
implementation of large arrays of oscillators in oscillatory neural networks to
solve the problem of classification and pattern recognition.
"
1728,Training DNA Perceptrons via Fractional Coding,"  This paper describes a novel approach to synthesize molecular reactions to
train a perceptron, i.e., a single-layered neural network, with sigmoidal
activation function. The approach is based on fractional coding where a
variable is represented by two molecules. The synergy between fractional coding
in molecular computing and stochastic logic implementations in electronic
computing is key to translating known stochastic logic circuits to molecular
computing. In prior work, a DNA perceptron with bipolar inputs and unipolar
output was proposed for inference. The focus of this paper is on synthesis of
molecular reactions for training of the DNA perceptron. A new molecular scaler
that performs multiplication by a factor greater than 1 is proposed based on
fractional coding. The training of the perceptron proposed in this paper is
based on a modified backpropagation equation as the exact equation cannot be
easily mapped to molecular reactions using fractional coding.
"
1729,Stochastic Magnetoelectric Neuron for Temporal Information Encoding,"  Emulating various facets of computing principles of the brain can potentially
lead to the development of neuro-computers that are able to exhibit brain-like
cognitive capabilities. In this letter, we propose a magnetoelectronic neuron
that utilizes noise as a computing resource and is able to encode information
over time through the independent control of external voltage signals. We
extensively characterize the device operation using simulations and demonstrate
its suitability for neuromorphic computing platforms performing temporal
information encoding.
"
1730,"Exploiting Oxide Based Resistive RAM Variability for Bayesian Neural
  Network Hardware Design","  Uncertainty plays a key role in real-time machine learning. As a significant
shift from standard deep networks, which does not consider any uncertainty
formulation during its training or inference, Bayesian deep networks are being
currently investigated where the network is envisaged as an ensemble of
plausible models learnt by the Bayes' formulation in response to uncertainties
in sensory data. Bayesian deep networks consider each synaptic weight as a
sample drawn from a probability distribution with learnt mean and variance.
This paper elaborates on a hardware design that exploits cycle-to-cycle
variability of oxide based Resistive Random Access Memories (RRAMs) as a means

1731,"Adaptive Non-Uniform Compressive Sensing using SOT-MRAM Multibit
  Crossbar Arrays","  A Compressive Sensing (CS) approach is applied to utilize intrinsic
computation capabilities of Spin-Orbit Torque Magnetic Random Access Memory
(SOT-MRAM) devices for IoT applications wherein lifetime energy, device area,
and manufacturing costs are highly-constrained while the sensing environment
varies rapidly. In this manuscript, we propose the Adaptive Compressed-sampling
via Multibit Crossbar Array (ACMCA) approach to intelligently generate the CS
measurement matrix using a multibit SOT-MRAM crossbar array. SPICE circuit and
MATLAB algorithm simulation results indicate that ACMCA reduces reconstruction
Time-Averaged Normalized Mean Squared Error (TNMSE) by 5dB on average while
providing up to 160$\mu$m$^2$ area reduction compared to a similar previous
design presented in the literature while incurring a negligible increase in the
energy consumption of generating the CS measurement matrix.

1732,Toward a Wired Ad Hoc Nanonetwork,"  Nanomachines promise to enable new medical applications, including drug
delivery and real time chemical reactions' detection inside the human body.
Such complex tasks need cooperation between nanomachines using a communication
network. Wireless Ad hoc networks, using molecular or electromagnetic-based
communication have been proposed in the literature to create flexible
nanonetworks between nanomachines. In this paper, we propose a Wired Ad hoc
NanoNETwork (WANNET) model design using actin-based nano-communication. In the
proposed model, actin filaments self-assembly and disassembly is used to create
flexible nanowires between nanomachines, and electrons are used as carriers of
information. We give a general overview of the application layer, Medium Access
Control (MAC) layer and a physical layer of the model. We also detail the
analytical model of the physical layer using actin nanowire equivalent
circuits, and we present an estimation of the circuit component's values.
Numerical results of the derived model are provided in terms of attenuation,
phase and delay as a function of the frequency and distances between
nanomachines. The maximum throughput of the actin-based nanowire is also
provided, and a comparison between the maximum throughput of the proposed
WANNET, vs other proposed approaches is presented. The obtained results prove
that the proposed wired ad hoc nanonetwork can give a very high achievable
throughput with a smaller delay compared to other proposed wireless molecular
communication networks.

1733,Reversible Computation in Wireless Communications,"  This chapter presents the pioneering work in applying reversible computation
paradigms to wireless communications. These applications range from developing
reversible hardware architectures for underwater acoustic communications to
novel distributed optimisation procedures in large radio-frequency antenna
arrays based on reversing Petri nets. Throughout the chapter, we discuss the
rationale for introducing reversible computation in the domain of wireless
communications, exploring the inherently reversible properties of communication
channels and systems formed by devices in a wireless network.
"
1734,"Implementation of Optical Deep Neural Networks using the Fabry-Perot
  Interferometer","  Future developments in deep learning applications requiring large datasets
will be limited by power and speed limitations of silicon based Von-Neumann
computing architectures. Optical architectures provide a low power and high
speed hardware alternative. Recent publications have suggested promising
implementations of optical neural networks (ONNs), showing huge orders of
magnitude efficiency and speed gains over current state of the art hardware
alternatives. In this work, the transmission of the Fabry-Perot Interferometer
(FPI) is proposed as a low power, low footprint activation function unit.
Numerical simulations of optical CNNs using the FPI based activation functions
show accuracies of 98% on the MNIST dataset. An investigation of possible
physical implementation of the network shows that an ONN based on current
tunable FPIs could be slowed by actuation delays, but rapidly developing
optical hardware fabrication techniques could make an integrated approach using
the proposed FPI setups a powerful solution for previously inaccessible deep
learning applications.
"
1735,"Oscillator Circuit for Spike Neural Network with Sigmoid Like Activation
  Function and Firing Rate Coding","  The study presents an oscillator circuit for a spike neural network with the
possibility of firing rate coding and sigmoid-like activation function. The
circuit contains a switching element with an S-shaped current-voltage
characteristic and two capacitors; one of the capacitors is shunted by a
control resistor. The circuit is characterised by a strong dependence of the
frequency of relaxation oscillations on the magnitude of the control resistor.
The dependence has a sigmoid-like form and we present an analytical method for
dependence calculation. Finally, we describe the concept of the spike neural
network architecture with firing rate coding based on the presented circuit for
creating neuromorphic devices and artificial intelligence.
"
1736,"Shenjing: A low power reconfigurable neuromorphic accelerator with
  partial-sum and spike networks-on-chip","  The next wave of on-device AI will likely require energy-efficient deep
neural networks. Brain-inspired spiking neural networks (SNN) has been
identified to be a promising candidate. Doing away with the need for
multipliers significantly reduces energy. For on-device applications, besides
computation, communication also incurs a significant amount of energy and time.
In this paper, we propose Shenjing, a configurable SNN architecture which fully
exposes all on-chip communications to software, enabling software mapping of
SNN models with high accuracy at low power. Unlike prior SNN architectures like
TrueNorth, Shenjing does not require any model modification and retraining for
the mapping. We show that conventional artificial neural networks (ANN) such as
multilayer perceptron, convolutional neural networks, as well as the latest
residual neural networks can be mapped successfully onto Shenjing, realizing
ANNs with SNN's energy efficiency. For the MNIST inference problem using a
multilayer perceptron, we were able to achieve an accuracy of 96% while
consuming just 1.26mW using 10 Shenjing cores.
"
1737,"Energy-efficient stochastic computing with superparamagnetic tunnel
  junctions","  Superparamagnetic tunnel junctions (SMTJs) have emerged as a competitive,
realistic nanotechnology to support novel forms of stochastic computation in
CMOS-compatible platforms. One of their applications is to generate random
bitstreams suitable for use in stochastic computing implementations. We
describe a method for digitally programmable bitstream generation based on
pre-charge sense amplifiers. This generator is significantly more energy
efficient than SMTJ-based bitstream generators that tune probabilities with
spin currents and a factor of two more efficient than related CMOS-based
implementations. The true randomness of this bitstream generator allows us to
use them as the fundamental units of a novel neural network architecture. To
take advantage of the potential savings, we codesign the algorithm with the
circuit, rather than directly transcribing a classical neural network into
hardware. The flexibility of the neural network mathematics allows us to adapt
the network to the explicitly energy efficient choices we make at the device
level. The result is a convolutional neural network design operating at
$\approx$ 150 nJ per inference with 97 % performance on MNIST -- a factor of
1.4 to 7.7 improvement in energy efficiency over comparable proposals in the
recent literature.
"
1738,"Representable Matrices: Enabling High Accuracy Analog Computation for
  Inference of DNNs using Memristors","  Analog computing based on memristor technology is a promising solution to
accelerating the inference phase of deep neural networks (DNNs). A fundamental
problem is to map an arbitrary matrix to a memristor crossbar array (MCA) while
maximizing the resulting computational accuracy. The state-of-the-art mapping
technique is based on a heuristic that only guarantees to produce the correct
output for two input vectors. In this paper, a technique that aims to produce
the correct output for every input vector is proposed, which involves
specifying the memristor conductance values and a scaling factor realized by
the peripheral circuitry. The key insight of the paper is that the conductance
matrix realized by an MCA is only required to be proportional to the target
matrix. The selection of the scaling factor between the two regulates the
utilization of the programmable memristor conductance range and the
representability of the target matrix. Consequently, the scaling factor is set
to balance precision and value range errors. Moreover, a technique of
converting conductance values into state variables and vice versa is proposed
to handle memristors with non-ideal device characteristics. Compared with the
state-of-the-art technique, the proposed mapping results in 4X-9X smaller
errors. The improvements translate into that the classification accuracy of a
seven-layer convolutional neural network (CNN) on CIFAR-10 is improved from
20.5% to 71.8%.
"
1739,"How to Efficiently Handle Complex Values? Implementing Decision Diagrams
  for Quantum Computing","  Quantum computing promises substantial speedups by exploiting quantum
mechanical phenomena such as superposition and entanglement. Corresponding
design methods require efficient means of representation and manipulation of
quantum functionality. In the classical domain, decision diagrams have been
successfully employed as a powerful alternative to straightforward means such
as truth tables. This motivated extensive research on whether decision diagrams
provide similar potential in the quantum domain -- resulting in new types of
decision diagrams capable of substantially reducing the complexity of
representing quantum states and functionality. From an implementation
perspective, many concepts and techniques from the classical domain can be
re-used in order to implement decision diagrams packages for the quantum realm.
However, new problems -- namely how to efficiently handle complex numbers --
arise. In this work, we propose a solution to overcome these problems.
Experimental evaluations confirm that this yields improvements of orders of
magnitude in the runtime needed to create and to utilize these decision
diagrams. The resulting implementation is publicly available as a quantum DD
package at http://iic.jku.at/eda/research/quantum_dd.
"
1740,"Neural Network-Inspired Analog-to-Digital Conversion to Achieve
  Super-Resolution with Low-Precision RRAM Devices","  Recent works propose neural network- (NN-) inspired analog-to-digital
converters (NNADCs) and demonstrate their great potentials in many emerging
applications. These NNADCs often rely on resistive random-access memory (RRAM)
devices to realize the NN operations and require high-precision RRAM cells
(6~12-bit) to achieve a moderate quantization resolution (4~8-bit). Such
optimistic assumption of RRAM resolution, however, is not supported by
fabrication data of RRAM arrays in large-scale production process. In this
paper, we propose an NN-inspired super-resolution ADC based on low-precision
RRAM devices by taking the advantage of a co-design methodology that combines a
pipelined hardware architecture with a custom NN training framework. Results
obtained from SPICE simulations demonstrate that our method leads to robust
design of a 14-bit super-resolution ADC using 3-bit RRAM devices with improved
power and speed performance and competitive figure-of-merits (FoMs). In
addition to the linear uniform quantization, the proposed ADC can also support
configurable high-resolution nonlinear quantization with high conversion speed
and low conversion energy, enabling future intelligent analog-to-information
interfaces for near-sensor analytics and processing.
"
1741,"Proq: Projection-based Runtime Assertions for Debugging on a Quantum
  Computer","  In this paper, we propose Proq, a runtime assertion scheme for testing and
debugging quantum programs on a quantum computer. The predicates in Proq are
represented by projections (or equivalently, closed subspaces of the state
space), following Birkhoff-von Neumann quantum logic. The satisfaction of a
projection by a quantum state can be directly checked upon a small number of
projective measurements rather than a large number of repeated executions. On
the theory side, we rigorously prove that checking projection-based assertions
can help locate bugs or statistically assure that the semantic function of the
tested program is close to what we expect, for both exact and approximate
quantum programs. On the practice side, we consider hardware constraints and
introduce several techniques to transform the assertions, making them directly
executable on the measurement-restricted quantum computers. We also propose to
achieve simplified assertion implementation using local projection technique
with soundness guaranteed. We compare Proq with existing quantum program
assertions and demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of Proq by its
applications to assert two ingenious quantum algorithms, the
Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd algorithm and Shor's algorithm.
"
1742,Towards Efficient Superconducting Quantum Processor Architecture Design,"  More computational resources (i.e., more physical qubits and qubit
connections) on a superconducting quantum processor not only improve the
performance but also result in more complex chip architecture with lower yield
rate. Optimizing both of them simultaneously is a difficult problem due to
their intrinsic trade-off. Inspired by the application-specific design
principle, this paper proposes an automatic design flow to generate simplified
superconducting quantum processor architecture with negligible performance loss
for different quantum programs. Our architecture-design-oriented profiling
method identifies program components and patterns critical to both the
performance and the yield rate. A follow-up hardware design flow decomposes the
complicated design procedure into three subroutines, each of which focuses on
different hardware components and cooperates with corresponding profiling
results and physical constraints. Experimental results show that our design
methodology could outperform IBM's general-purpose design schemes with better
Pareto-optimal results.
"
1743,Error-mitigated data-driven circuit learning on noisy quantum hardware,"  Application-inspired benchmarks measure how well a quantum device performs
meaningful calculations. In the case of parameterized circuit training, the
computational task is the preparation of a target quantum state via
optimization over a loss landscape. This is complicated by various sources of
noise, fixed hardware connectivity, and for generative modeling, the choice of
target distribution. Gradient-based training has become a useful benchmarking
task for noisy intermediate scale quantum computers because of the additional
requirement that the optimization step uses the quantum device to estimate the
loss function gradient. In this work we use gradient-based data-driven circuit
learning to benchmark the performance of several superconducting platform
devices and present results that show how error mitigation can improve the
training of quantum circuit Born machines with $28$ tunable parameters.
"
1744,"Scheduler of quantum circuits based on dynamical pattern improvement and
  its application to hardware design","  As quantum hardware increases in complexity, successful algorithmic execution
relies more heavily on awareness of existing device constraints. In this work
we focus on the problem of routing quantum information across the machine to
overcome the limited connectivity of quantum hardware. Previous approaches
address the problem for each two-qubit gate separately and then impose the
compatibility of the different routes. Here we shift the focus onto the set of
all routing operations that are possible at any given time and favor those that
most benefit the global pattern of two-qubit gates. We benchmark our
optimization technique by scheduling variational algorithms for transmon chips.
Finally we apply our scheduler to the design problem of quantifying the impact
of manufacturing decisions. Specifically, we address the number of distinct
qubit frequencies in superconducting architectures and how they affect the
algorithmic performance of the quantum Fourier transform.
"
1745,Actin Networks Voltage Circuits,"  Starting with an experimentally observed networks of actin bundles, we model
their network structure in terms of edges and nodes. We then compute and
discuss the main electrical parameters, considering the bundles as electrical
wires. A set of equations describing the network is solved with several initial
conditions. Input voltages, that can be considered as information bits, are
applied in a set of points and output voltages are computed in another set of
positions. We consider both an idealized situation, where point-like electrodes
can be inserted in any points of the bundles and a more realistic one, where
electrodes lay on a surface and have typical dimensions available in the
industry. We find that in both cases such a system can implement the main
logical gates and a finite state machine.
"
1746,"A binary-activation, multi-level weight RNN and training algorithm for
  ADC-/DAC-free and noise-resilient processing-in-memory inference with eNVM","  We propose a new algorithm for training neural networks with binary
activations and multi-level weights, which enables efficient
processing-in-memory circuits with embedded nonvolatile memories (eNVM). Binary
activations obviate costly DACs and ADCs. Multi-level weights leverage
multi-level eNVM cells. Compared to existing algorithms, our method not only
works for feed-forward networks (e.g., fully-connected and convolutional), but
also achieves higher accuracy and noise resilience for recurrent networks. In
particular, we present an RNN-based trigger-word detection PIM accelerator,
with detailed hardware noise models and circuit co-design techniques, and
validate our algorithm's high inference accuracy and robustness against a
variety of real hardware non-idealities.
"
1747,Road traffic reservoir computing,"  Reservoir computing derived from recurrent neural networks is more applicable
to real world systems than deep learning because of its low computational cost
and potential for physical implementation. Specifically, physical reservoir
computing, which replaces the dynamics of reservoir units with physical
phenomena, has recently received considerable attention. In this study, we
propose a method of exploiting the dynamics of road traffic as a reservoir, and
numerically confirm its feasibility by applying several prediction tasks based
on a simple mathematical model of the traffic flow.
"
1748,"Spin-Orbit-Torque-based Devices, Circuits and Architectures","  Spintronics, the use of spin of an electron instead of its charge, has
received huge attention from research communities for different applications
including memory, interconnects, logic implementation, neuromorphic computing,
and many other applications. Here, in this paper, we review the works within
spintronics, more specifically on spin-orbit torque (SOT) within different
research groups. We also provide researchers an insight into the future
potentials of the SOT-based designs. This comprehensive review paper covers
different aspects of SOT-based design from device and circuit to architecture
level as well as more ambitious and futuristic applications of such technology.
"
1749,A Verified Optimizer for Quantum Circuits,"  We present VOQC, the first fully verified optimizer for quantum circuits,
written using the Coq proof assistant. Quantum circuits are expressed as
programs in a simple, low-level language called SQIR, a simple quantum
intermediate representation, which is deeply embedded in Coq. Optimizations and
other transformations are expressed as Coq functions, which are proved correct
with respect to a semantics of SQIR programs. SQIR uses a semantics of matrices
of complex numbers, which is the standard for quantum computation, but treats
matrices symbolically in order to reason about programs that use an arbitrary
number of quantum bits. SQIR's careful design and our provided automation make
it possible to write and verify a broad range of optimizations in VOQC,
including full-circuit transformations from cutting-edge optimizers.
"
1750,Heuristics for Quantum Compiling with a Continuous Gate Set,"  We present an algorithm for compiling arbitrary unitaries into a sequence of
gates native to a quantum processor. As accurate CNOT gates are hard for the
foreseeable Noisy- Intermediate-Scale Quantum devices era, our A* inspired
algorithm attempts to minimize their count, while accounting for connectivity.
We discuss the search strategy together with metrics to expand the solution
frontier. For a workload of circuits with complexity appropriate for the NISQ
era, we produce solutions well within the best upper bounds published in
literature and match or exceed hand tuned implementations, as well as other
existing synthesis alternatives. In particular, when comparing against
state-of-the-art available synthesis packages we show 2.4x average (up to 5.3x)
reduction in CNOT count. We also show how to re-target the algorithm for a
different chip topology and native gate set, while obtaining similar quality
results. We believe that empirical tools like ours can facilitate algorithmic
exploration, gate set discovery for quantum processor designers, as well as
providing useful optimization blocks within the quantum compilation tool-chain.
"
1751,"Towards An Implementation of the Subset-sum Problem on the IBM Quantum
  Experience","  In seeking out an algorithm to test out the capability of the IBM Quantum
Experience quantum computer, we were given a review paper covering various
algorithms for solving the subset-sum problem, including both classical and
quantum algorithms. The paper went on to present a novel algorithm that beat
the previous best algorithm known at the time. The complex nature of the
algorithm made it difficult to see a path for implementation on the Quantum
Experience machine and the exponential cost - only slightly better than the
best classical algorithm - left us looking for a different approach for solving
this problem. We present here a new quantum algorithm for solving the
subset-sum problem that for many cases should lead to O(poly(n))-time to
solution. The work is reminiscent of the verification procedure used in a
polynomial-time algorithm for the quantum Arthur-Merlin games presented
elsewhere, where the use of a quantum binary search to find a maximum
eigenvalue in the final output stage has been adapted to the subset-sum problem
as in another paper.
"
1752,"Channel Modeling for Synaptic Molecular Communication With Re-uptake and
  Reversible Receptor Binding","  In Diffusive Molecular Communication (DMC), information is transmitted by
diffusing molecules. Synaptic signaling is a natural implementation of this
paradigm. It is responsible for relaying information from one neuron to
another, but also provides support for complex functionalities, such as
learning and memory. Many of its features are not yet understood, some are,
however, known to be critical for robust, reliable neural communication. In
particular, some synapses feature a re-uptake mechanism at the presynaptic
neuron, which provides a means for removing neurotransmitters from the synaptic
cleft and for recycling them for future reuse. In this paper, we develop a
comprehensive channel model for synaptic DMC encompassing a spatial model of
the synaptic cleft, molecule re-uptake at the presynaptic neuron, and
reversible binding to individual receptors at the postsynaptic neuron. Based on
this model, we derive an analytical time domain expression for the channel
impulse response (CIR) of the synaptic DMC system. Our model explicitly
incorporates macroscopic physical channel parameters and can be used to
evaluate the impact of re-uptake, receptor density, and channel width on the
CIR of the synaptic DMC system. Furthermore, we provide results from
particlebased computer simulation, which validate the analytical model. The
proposed comprehensive channel model for synaptic DMC systems can be exploited
for the investigation of challenging problems, like the quantification of the
inter-symbol interference between successive synaptic signals and the design of
synthetic neural communication systems.

1753,"Exploiting Dual-Gate Ambipolar CNFETs for Scalable Machine Learning
  Classification","  Ambipolar carbon nanotube based field-effect transistors (AP-CNFETs) exhibit
unique electrical characteristics, such as tri-state operation and
bi-directionality, enabling systems with complex and reconfigurable computing.
In this paper, AP-CNFETs are used to design a mixed-signal machine learning
(ML) classifier. The classifier is designed in SPICE with feature size of 15 nm
and operates at 250 MHz. The system is demonstrated based on MNIST digit
dataset, yielding 90% accuracy and no accuracy degradation as compared with the
classification of this dataset in Python. The system also exhibits lower power
consumption and smaller physical size as compared with the state-of-the-art
CMOS and memristor based mixed-signal classifiers.
"
1754,"A SOT-MRAM-based Processing-In-Memory Engine for Highly Compressed DNN
  Implementation","  The computing wall and data movement challenges of deep neural networks
(DNNs) have exposed the limitations of conventional CMOS-based DNN
accelerators. Furthermore, the deep structure and large model size will make
DNNs prohibitive to embedded systems and IoT devices, where low power
consumption are required. To address these challenges, spin orbit torque
magnetic random-access memory (SOT-MRAM) and SOT-MRAM based
Processing-In-Memory (PIM) engines have been used to reduce the power
consumption of DNNs since SOT-MRAM has the characteristic of near-zero standby
power, high density, none-volatile. However, the drawbacks of SOT-MRAM based
PIM engines such as high writing latency and requiring low bit-width data
decrease its popularity as a favorable energy efficient DNN accelerator. To
mitigate these drawbacks, we propose an ultra energy efficient framework by
using model compression techniques including weight pruning and quantization
from the software level considering the architecture of SOT-MRAM PIM. And we
incorporate the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) into the
training phase to further guarantee the solution feasibility and satisfy
SOT-MRAM hardware constraints. Thus, the footprint and power consumption of
SOT-MRAM PIM can be reduced, while increasing the overall system throughput at
the meantime, making our proposed ADMM-based SOT-MRAM PIM more energy
efficiency and suitable for embedded systems or IoT devices. Our experimental
results show the accuracy and compression rate of our proposed framework is
consistently outperforming the reference works, while the efficiency (area \&
power) and throughput of SOT-MRAM PIM engine is significantly improved.
"
1755,"A recipe for creating ideal hybrid memristive-CMOS neuromorphic
  computing systems","  The development of memristive device technologies has reached a level of
maturity to enable the design of complex and large-scale hybrid memristive-CMOS
neural processing systems. These systems offer promising solutions for
implementing novel in-memory computing architectures for machine learning and
data analysis problems. We argue that they are also ideal building blocks for
the integration in neuromorphic electronic circuits suitable for ultra-low
power brain-inspired sensory processing systems, therefore leading to the
innovative solutions for always-on edge-computing and Internet-of-Things (IoT)
applications. Here we present a recipe for creating such systems based on
design strategies and computing principles inspired by those used in mammalian
brains. We enumerate the specifications and properties of memristive devices
required to support always-on learning in neuromorphic computing systems and to
minimize their power consumption. Finally, we discuss in what cases such
neuromorphic systems can complement conventional processing ones and highlight
the importance of exploiting the physics of both the memristive devices and of
the CMOS circuits interfaced to them.
"
1756,CRNs Exposed: Systematic Exploration of Chemical Reaction Networks,"  Formal methods have enabled breakthroughs in many fields, such as in hardware
verification, machine learning and biological systems. The key object of
interest in systems biology, synthetic biology, and molecular programming is
chemical reaction networks (CRNs) which formalizes coupled chemical reactions
in a well-mixed solution. CRNs are pivotal for our understanding of biological
regulatory and metabolic networks, as well as for programming engineered
molecular behavior. Although it is clear that small CRNs are capable of complex
dynamics and computational behavior, it remains difficult to explore the space
of CRNs in search for desired functionality. We use Alloy, a tool for
expressing structural constraints and behavior in software systems, to
enumerate CRNs with declaratively specified properties. We show how this
framework can enumerate CRNs with a variety of structural constraints including
biologically motivated catalytic networks and metabolic networks, and seesaw
networks motivated by DNA nanotechnology. We also use the framework to explore
analog function computation in rate-independent CRNs. By computing the desired
output value with stoichiometry rather than with reaction rates (in the sense
that $X \to Y+Y$ computes multiplication by $2$), such CRNs are completely
robust to the choice of reaction rates or rate law. We find the smallest CRNs
computing the max, minmax, abs and ReLU (rectified linear unit) functions in a
natural subclass of rate-independent CRNs where rate-independence follows from
structural network properties.

1757,"Erase-hidden and Drivability-improved Magnetic Non-Volatile Flip-Flops
  with NAND-SPIN Devices","  Non-volatile flip-flops (NVFFs) using power gating techniques promise to
overcome the soaring leakage power consumption issue with the scaling of CMOS
technology. Magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) is a good candidate for constructing
the NVFF thanks to its low power, high speed, good CMOS compatibility, etc. In
this paper, we propose a novel magnetic NVFF based on an emerging memory device
called NAND-SPIN. The data writing of NAND-SPIN is achieved by successively
applying two unidirectional currents, which respectively generate the spin
orbit torque (SOT) and spin transfer torque (STT) for erase and programming
operations. This characteristic allows us to design an erase-hidden and
drivability-improved magnetic NVFF. Furthermore, more design flexibility could
be obtained since the backup operation of the proposed NVFF is not limited by
the inherent slave latch. Simulation results show that our proposed NVFF
achieves performance improvement in terms of power, delay and area, compared
with conventional slave-latch-driven SOT-NVFF designs.
"
1758,The Recurrent Processing Unit: Hardware for High Speed Machine Learning,"  Machine learning applications are computationally demanding and power
intensive. Hardware acceleration of these software tools is a natural step
being explored using various technologies. A recurrent processing unit (RPU) is
fast and power-efficient hardware for machine learning under development at the
University of Maryland. It is comprised of a recurrent neural network and a
trainable output vector as a hardware implementation of a reservoir computer.
The reservoir is currently realized on both Xilinx 7-series and Ultrascale+
ZYNQ SoCs using an autonomous Boolean network for processing and a Python-based
software API. The RPU is capable of classifying up to 40M MNIST images per
second with the reservoir consuming under 261mW of power. Using an array of
2048 unclocked gates with roughly 100pS transition times, we achieve about 20
TOPS and 75 TOPS/W.
"
1759,"Towards Smart Wireless Communications via Intelligent Reflecting
  Surfaces: A Contemporary Survey","  This paper presents a literature review on recent applications and design
aspects of the intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) in the future wireless
networks. Conventionally, the network optimization has been limited to
transmission control at two endpoints, i.e., end users and network controller.
The fading wireless channel is uncontrollable and becomes one of the main
limiting factors for performance improvement. The IRS is composed of a large
array of scattering elements, which can be individually configured to generate
additional phase shifts to the signal reflections. Hence, it can actively
control the signal propagation properties in favor of signal reception, and
thus realize the notion of a smart radio environment. As such, the IRS's phase
control, combined with the conventional transmission control, can potentially
bring performance gain compared to wireless networks without IRS. In this
survey, we first introduce basic concepts of the IRS and the realizations of
its reconfigurability. Then, we focus on applications of the IRS in wireless
communications. We overview different performance metrics and analytical
approaches to characterize the performance improvement of IRS-assisted wireless
networks. To exploit the performance gain, we discuss the joint optimization of
the IRS's phase control and the transceivers' transmission control in different
network design problems, e.g.,~rate maximization and power minimization
problems. Furthermore, we extend the discussion of IRS-assisted wireless
networks to some emerging use cases. Finally, we highlight important practical
challenges and future research directions for realizing IRS-assisted wireless
networks in beyond 5G communications.
"
1760,"Valley-Coupled-Spintronic Non-Volatile Memories with Compute-In-Memory
  Support","  In this work, we propose valley-coupled spin-hall memories (VSH-MRAMs) based
on monolayer WSe2. The key features of the proposed memories are (a) the
ability to switch magnets with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) via VSH
effect and (b) an integrated gate that can modulate the charge/spin current
(IC/IS) flow. The former attribute results in high energy efficiency (compared
to the Giant-Spin Hall (GSH) effect-based devices with in-plane magnetic
anisotropy (IMA) magnets). The latter feature leads to a compact access
transistor-less memory array design. We experimentally measure the gate
controllability of the current as well as the nonlocal resistance associated
with VSH effect. Based on the measured data, we develop a simulation framework
(using physical equations) to propose and analyze single-ended and differential
VSH effect based magnetic memories (VSH-MRAM and DVSH-MRAM, respectively). At
the array level, the proposed VSH/DVSH-MRAMs achieve 50%/ 11% lower write time,
59%/ 67% lower write energy and 35%/ 41% lower read energy at iso-sense margin,
compared to single ended/differential (GSH/DGSH)-MRAMs. System level evaluation
in the context of general purpose processor and intermittently-powered system
shows up to 3.14X and 1.98X better energy efficiency for the proposed
(D)VSH-MRAMs over (D)GSH-MRAMs respectively. Further, the differential sensing
of the proposed DVSH-MRAM leads to natural and simultaneous in-memory
computation of bit-wise AND and NOR logic functions. Using this feature, we
design a computation-in-memory (CiM) architecture that performs Boolean logic
and addition (ADD) with a single array access. System analysis performed by
integrating our DVSH-MRAM: CiM in the Nios II processor across various
application benchmarks shows up to 2.66X total energy savings, compared to
DGSH-MRAM: CiM.

1761,"Defects Mitigation in Resistive Crossbars for Analog Vector Matrix
  Multiplication","  With storage and computation happening at the same place, computing in
resistive crossbars minimizes data movement and avoids the memory bottleneck
issue. It leads to ultra-high energy efficiency for data-intensive
applications. However, defects in crossbars severely affect computing accuracy.
Existing solutions, including re-training with defects and redundant designs,
but they have limitations in practical implementations. In this work, we
introduce row shuffling and output compensation to mitigate defects without
re-training or redundant resistive crossbars. We also analyzed the coupling
effects of defects and circuit parasitics. Moreover, We study different
combinations of methods to achieve the best trade-off between cost and
performance. Our proposed methods could rescue up to 10% of defects in
ResNet-20 application without performance degradation.

1762,"Three dimensional waveguide-interconnects for scalable integration of
  photonic neural networks","  Photonic waveguides are prime candidates for integrated and parallel photonic
interconnects. Such interconnects correspond to large-scale vector matrix
products, which are at the heart of neural network computation. However,
parallel interconnect circuits realized in two dimensions, for example by
lithography, are strongly limited in size due to disadvantageous scaling. We
use three dimensional (3D) printed photonic waveguides to overcome this
limitation. 3D optical-couplers with fractal topology efficiently connect large
numbers of input and output channels, and we show that the substrate's
footprint area scales linearly. Going beyond simple couplers, we introduce
functional circuits for discrete spatial filters identical to those used in
deep convolutional neural networks.

1763,"Design Flow of Digital Microfluidic Biochips Towards Improving
  Fault-Tolerance","  Given the ever-increasing advances of digital microfluidic biochips and their
application in a wide range of areas including bio-chemistry experiments,
diagnostics, and monitoring purposes like air and water quality control and
etc., development of automated design flow algorithms for digital microfluidic
biochips is of great importance. During the course of last decade there have
been numerous researches on design, adaptation and optimization of algorithms
for automation of digital microfluidic biochips synthesis flow. However, the
initial assumption of researchers about absence of faults and deficiencies
before and during execution of bio-assays has been proven always not to be the
case. Thus, during the past few years researchers have placed great focus on
fault-tolerance and fault-recovery of digital microfluidic biochips. In this
dissertation we initially introduce proposed architectures for pin-constrained
digital microfluidic biochips; the proposed architectures are designed with the
aim of improving overall functionality and also at the same time ameliorating
fault-tolerance of digital microfluidic biochips in mind. Next, we explain
fault-tolerance concepts within the context of pin-constrained digital
microfluidic biochips; then we attempt to investigate fault-tolerance of the
proposed digital microfluidic architectures versus the base architecture in
presence of faults occurrences affecting mixing modules and
splitting/storage/detection (SSD) modules.

1764,"Quantum-inspired annealers as Boltzmann generators for machine learning
  and statistical physics","  Quantum simulators and processors are rapidly improving nowadays, but they
are still not able to solve complex and multidimensional tasks of practical
value. However, certain numerical algorithms inspired by the physics of real
quantum devices prove to be efficient in application to specific problems,
related, for example, to combinatorial optimization. Here we implement a
numerical annealer based on simulating the coherent Ising machine as a tool to
sample from a high-dimensional Boltzmann probability distribution with the
energy functional defined by the classical Ising Hamiltonian. Samples provided
by such a generator are then utilized for the partition function estimation of
this distribution and for the training of a general Boltzmann machine. Our
study opens up a door to practical application of numerical quantum-inspired
annealers.

1765,"Mitigate Parasitic Resistance in Resistive Crossbar-based Convolutional
  Neural Networks","  Traditional computing hardware often encounters on-chip memory bottleneck on
large scale Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) applications. With its unique
in-memory computing feature, resistive crossbar-based computing attracts
researchers' attention as a promising solution to the memory bottleneck issue
in von Neumann architectures. However, the parasitic resistances in the
crossbar deviate its behavior from the ideal weighted summation operation. In
large-scale implementations, the impact of parasitic resistances must be
carefully considered and mitigated to ensure circuits' functionality. In this
work, we implemented and simulated CNNs on resistive crossbar circuits with
consideration of parasitic resistances. Moreover, we carried out a new mapping
scheme for high utilization of crossbar arrays on convolution, and a mitigation
algorithm to mitigate parasitic resistances in CNN applications. The mitigation
algorithm considers parasitic resistances as well as data/kernel patterns of
each layer to minimize the computing error in crossbar-based convolutions of
CNNs. We demonstrated the proposed methods with implementations of a 4-layer
CNN on MNIST and ResNet(20, 32, and 56) on CIFAR-10. Simulation results show
the proposed methods well mitigate the parasitic resistances in crossbars. With
our methods, modern CNNs on crossbars can preserve ideal(software) level
classification accuracy with 6-bit ADCs and DACs implementation.
"
1766,"Intelligent Wireless Sensor Nodes for Human Footstep Sound
  Classification for Security Application","  Sensor nodes present in a wireless sensor network (WSN) for security
surveillance applications should preferably be small, energy-efficient and
inexpensive with on-sensor computational abilities. An appropriate data
processing scheme in the sensor node can help in reducing the power dissipation
of the transceiver through compression of information to be communicated. In
this paper, authors have attempted a simulation-based study of human footstep
sound classification in natural surroundings using simple time-domain features.
We used a spiking neural network (SNN), a computationally low weight
classifier, derived from an artificial neural network (ANN), for
classification. A classification accuracy greater than 85% is achieved using an
SNN, degradation of ~5% as compared to ANN. The SNN scheme, along with the
required feature extraction scheme, can be amenable to low power sub-threshold
analog implementation. Results show that all analog implementation of the
proposed SNN scheme can achieve significant power savings over the digital
implementation of the same computing scheme and also over other conventional
digital architectures using frequency-domain feature extraction and ANN-based
classification.
"
1767,"Towards Multicellular Biological Deep Neural Nets Based on
  Transcriptional Regulation","  Artificial neurons built on synthetic gene networks have potential
applications ranging from complex cellular decision-making to bioreactor
regulation. Furthermore, due to the high information throughput of natural
systems, it provides an interesting candidate for biologically-based
supercomputing and analog simulations of traditionally intractable problems. In
this paper, we propose an architecture for constructing multicellular neural
networks and programmable nonlinear systems. We design an artificial neuron
based on gene regulatory networks and optimize its dynamics for modularity.
Using gene expression models, we simulate its ability to perform arbitrary
linear classifications from multiple inputs. Finally, we construct a two-layer
neural network to demonstrate scalability and nonlinear decision boundaries and
discuss future directions for utilizing uncontrolled neurons in computational
tasks.
"
1768,"Fast and deep: energy-efficient neuromorphic learning with first-spike
  times","  For a biological agent operating under environmental pressure, energy
consumption and reaction times are of critical importance. Similarly,
engineered systems also strive for short time-to-solution and low
energy-to-solution characteristics. At the level of neuronal implementation,
this implies achieving the desired results with as few and as early spikes as
possible. In the time-to-first-spike-coding framework, both of these goals are
inherently emerging features of learning. Here, we describe a rigorous
derivation of learning such first-spike times in networks of leaky
integrate-and-fire neurons, relying solely on input and output spike times, and
show how it can implement error backpropagation in hierarchical spiking
networks. Furthermore, we emulate our framework on the BrainScaleS-2
neuromorphic system and demonstrate its capability of harnessing the chip's
speed and energy characteristics. Finally, we examine how our approach
generalizes to other neuromorphic platforms by studying how its performance is
affected by typical distortive effects induced by neuromorphic substrates.
"
1769,"PANTHER: A Programmable Architecture for Neural Network Training
  Harnessing Energy-efficient ReRAM","  The wide adoption of deep neural networks has been accompanied by
ever-increasing energy and performance demands due to the expensive nature of
training them. Numerous special-purpose architectures have been proposed to
accelerate training: both digital and hybrid digital-analog using resistive RAM
(ReRAM) crossbars. ReRAM-based accelerators have demonstrated the effectiveness
of ReRAM crossbars at performing matrix-vector multiplication operations that
are prevalent in training. However, they still suffer from inefficiency due to
the use of serial reads and writes for performing the weight gradient and
update step. A few works have demonstrated the possibility of performing outer
products in crossbars, which can be used to realize the weight gradient and
update step without the use of serial reads and writes. However, these works
have been limited to low precision operations which are not sufficient for
typical training workloads. Moreover, they have been confined to a limited set
of training algorithms for fully-connected layers only. To address these
limitations, we propose a bit-slicing technique for enhancing the precision of
ReRAM-based outer products, which is substantially different from bit-slicing
for matrix-vector multiplication only. We incorporate this technique into a
crossbar architecture with three variants catered to different training
algorithms. To evaluate our design on different types of layers in neural
networks (fully-connected, convolutional, etc.) and training algorithms, we
develop PANTHER, an ISA-programmable training accelerator with compiler
support. Our evaluation shows that PANTHER achieves up to $8.02\times$,
$54.21\times$, and $103\times$ energy reductions as well as $7.16\times$,
$4.02\times$, and $16\times$ execution time reductions compared to digital
accelerators, ReRAM-based accelerators, and GPUs, respectively.
"
1770,"Quantum Computer Control using Novel, Hybrid
  Semiconductor-Superconductor Electronics","  Inspired by recent interest in quantum computing and recent studies of cryo
CMOS for control electronics, this paper presents a hybrid
semiconductor-superconductor approach for engineering scalable computing
systems that operate across the gradient between room temperature and the
temperature of a cryogenic payload. Such a hybrid computer architecture would
have unique suitability to quantum computers, scalable sensors, and the quantum
internet. The approach is enabled by Cryogenic Adiabatic Transistor Circuits
(CATCs), a novel way of using adiabatic circuits to substantially reduce
cooling requirements. In a hybrid chip of CATCs and a second technology, such
as Josephson junctions (JJs) or cryo CMOS, the CATCs complement the speed,
power, and density of the second technology as well as becoming a longsought
cryogenic memory. This paper describes higher-level design principles for CATC
hybrids with a quantum computer control system that includes CATC memory, an
FPGA-like logic module that uses CATC for dense configuration logic and JJs for
fast configured logic, and I/O subsystems including microwave modulators and
low frequency control signals.
"
1771,Nonlinear systems for unconventional computing,"  The search for new computational machines beyond the traditional von Neumann
architecture has given rise to a modern area of nonlinear science --
development of unconventional computing -- requiring the efforts of
mathematicians, physicists and engineers. Many analogue physical systems
including nonlinear oscillator networks, lasers, and condensates were proposed
and realised to address hard computational problems from various areas of
social and physical sciences and technology. The analogue systems emulate spin
Hamiltonians with continuous or discrete degrees of freedom to which actual
optimisation problems can be mapped. Understanding the underlying physical
process by which the system finds the ground state often leads to new classes
of system-inspired or quantum-inspired algorithms for hard optimisation.
Together physical platforms and related algorithms can be combined to form a
hybrid architecture that may one day compete with conventional computing. In
this Chapter, we review some of the systems and physically-inspired algorithms
that show such promise.
"
1772,"Design Considerations for Efficient Deep Neural Networks on
  Processing-in-Memory Accelerators","  This paper describes various design considerations for deep neural networks
that enable them to operate efficiently and accurately on processing-in-memory
accelerators. We highlight important properties of these accelerators and the
resulting design considerations using experiments conducted on various
state-of-the-art deep neural networks with the large-scale ImageNet dataset.
"
1773,"Backpropagation through nonlinear units for all-optical training of
  neural networks","  Backpropagation through nonlinear neurons is an outstanding challenge to the
field of optical neural networks and the major conceptual barrier to
all-optical training schemes. Each neuron is required to exhibit a
directionally dependent response to propagating optical signals, with the
backwards response conditioned on the forward signal, which is highly
non-trivial to implement optically. We propose a practical and surprisingly
simple solution that uses saturable absorption to provide the network
nonlinearity. We find that the backward propagating gradients required to train
the network can be approximated in a pump-probe scheme that requires only
passive optical elements. Simulations show that, with readily obtainable
optical depths, our approach can achieve equivalent performance to
state-of-the-art computational networks on image classification benchmarks,
even in deep networks with multiple sequential gradient approximations. This
scheme is compatible with leading optical neural network proposals and
therefore provides a feasible path towards end-to-end optical training.
"
1774,"Performance Analysis of TLS for Quantum Robust Cryptography on a
  Constrained Device","  Advances in quantum computing make Shor's algorithm for factorising numbers
ever more tractable. This threatens the security of any cryptographic system
which often relies on the difficulty of factorisation. It also threatens
methods based on discrete logarithms, such as with the Diffie-Hellman key
exchange method. For a cryptographic system to remain secure against a quantum
adversary, we need to build methods based on a hard mathematical problem, which
are not susceptible to Shor's algorithm and which create Post Quantum
Cryptography (PQC). While high-powered computing devices may be able to run
these new methods, we need to investigate how well these methods run on limited
powered devices. This paper outlines an evaluation framework for PQC within
constrained devices, and contributes to the area by providing benchmarks of the
front-running algorithms on a popular single-board low-power device.
"
1775,"A Quantum Computational Approach to Correspondence Problems on Point
  Sets","  Modern adiabatic quantum computers (AQC) are already used to solve difficult
combinatorial optimisation problems in various domains of science. Currently,
only a few applications of AQC in computer vision have been demonstrated. We
review AQC and derive a new algorithm for correspondence problems on point sets
suitable for execution on AQC. Our algorithm has a subquadratic computational
complexity of the state preparation. Examples of successful transformation
estimation and point set alignment by simulated sampling are shown in the
systematic experimental evaluation. Finally, we analyse the differences in the
solutions and the corresponding energy values.
"
1776,MTJ-Based Hardware Synapse Design for Quantized Deep Neural Networks,"  Quantized neural networks (QNNs) are being actively researched as a solution
for the computational complexity and memory intensity of deep neural networks.
This has sparked efforts to develop algorithms that support both inference and
training with quantized weight and activation values without sacrificing
accuracy. A recent example is the GXNOR framework for stochastic training of
ternary and binary neural networks. In this paper, we introduce a novel
hardware synapse circuit that uses magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) devices to
support the GXNOR training. Our solution enables processing near memory (PNM)
of QNNs, therefore can further reduce the data movements from and into the
memory. We simulated MTJ-based stochastic training of a TNN over the MNIST and
SVHN datasets and achieved an accuracy of 98.61% and 93.99%, respectively.
"
1777,Fungal architecture,"  As one of the primary consumers of environmental resource, the building
industry faces unprecedented challenges in needing to reduce the environmental
impact of current consumption practices. This applies to both the construction
of the built environment and resource consumption during its occupation and
use. Where incremental improvements to current practices can be realised, the
net benefits are often far outstripped by the burgeoning demands of rapidly
increasing population growth and urbanisation. Against the backdrop of this
grand societal challenge, it is necessary to explore approaches that envision a
paradigm shift in how material is sourced, processed and assembled to address
the magnitude of these challenges in a truly sustainable way, and which can
even provide added value. We propose to develop a structural substrate by using
live fungal mycelium, functionalise the substrate with nanoparticles and
polymers to make a mycelium-based electronics, implement sensorial fusion and
decision making in the fungal electronics and to growing monolithic buildings
from the functionalised fungal substrate. Fungal buildings will self-grow,
build, and repair themselves subject to substrate supplied, use natural
adaptation to the environment, sense all what human can sense.
"
1778,Brain-to-brain Wireless Communication and Technologies Beyond 5G,"  During the last few years, intensive research efforts are being done in the
field of brain interfaces to extract neuro-information from the signals
representing neuronal activities in the human brain. A recent development of
these interfaces is capable of direct communication between animals' brains,
enabling direct brain-to-brain communication. Although these results are new
and the experimental scenario simple, the fast development in neuroscience, and
information and communication technologies indicate the potential of new
scenarios for wireless communications between brains. Depending of the specific
kind of neuro-activity to be communicated, the brain-to-brain link shall follow
strict requirements of high data rates, low-latency, and reliable
communication. In this paper we highlight key beyond 5G technologies that
potentially will support this promising approach.
"
1779,A single layer artificial neural network with engineered bacteria,"  The abstract mathematical rules of artificial neural network (ANN) are
implemented through computation using electronic computers, photonics and
in-vitro DNA computation. Here we demonstrate the physical realization of ANN
in living bacterial cells. We created a single layer ANN using engineered
bacteria, where a single bacterium works as an artificial neuron and
demonstrated a 2-to-4 decoder and a 1-to-2 de-multiplexer for processing
chemical signals. The inputs were extracellular chemical signals, which
linearly combined and got processed through a non-linear log-sigmoid activation
function to produce fluorescent protein outputs. The activation function was
generated by synthetic genetic circuits, and for each artificial neuron, the
weight and bias values were adjusted manually by engineering the molecular
interactions within the bacterial neuron to represent a specific logical
function. The artificial bacterial neurons were connected as ANN architectures
to implement a 2-to-4 chemical decoder and a 1-to-2 chemical de-multiplexer. To
our knowledge, this is the first ANN created by artificial bacterial neurons.
Thus, it may open up a new direction in ANN research, where engineered
biological cells can be used as ANN enabled hardware.
"
1780,"Thermal coupling and effect of subharmonic synchronization in a system
  of two VO2 based oscillators","  We explore a prototype of an oscillatory neural network (ONN) based on
vanadium dioxide switching devices. The model system under study represents two
oscillators based on thermally coupled VO2 switches. Numerical simulation shows
that the effective action radius RTC of coupling depends both on the total
energy released during switching and on the average power. It is experimentally
and numerically proved that the temperature change dT commences almost
synchronously with the released power peak and T-coupling reveals itself up to
a frequency of about 10 kHz. For the studied switching structure configuration,
the RTC value varies over a wide range from 4 to 45 mkm, depending on the
external circuit capacitance C and resistance Ri, but the variation of Ri is
more promising from the practical viewpoint. In the case of a ""weak"" coupling,
synchronization is accompanied by attraction effect and decrease of the main
spectra harmonics width. In the case of a ""strong"" coupling, the number of
effects increases, synchronization can occur on subharmonics resulting in
multilevel stable synchronization of two oscillators. An advanced algorithm for
synchronization efficiency and subharmonic ratio calculation is proposed. It is
shown that of the two oscillators the leading one is that with a higher main
frequency, and, in addition, the frequency stabilization effect is observed.
Also, in the case of a strong thermal coupling, the limit of the supply current
parameters, for which the oscillations exist, expands by ~ 10 %. The obtained
results have a universal character and open up a new kind of coupling in ONNs,
namely, T-coupling, which allows for easy transition from 2D to 3D integration.
The effect of subharmonic synchronization hold promise for application in
classification and pattern recognition.
"
1781,"Model Predictive Control for Finite Input Systems using the D-Wave
  Quantum Annealer","  The D-Wave quantum annealer has emerged as a novel computational architecture
that is attracting significant interest, but there have been only a few
practical algorithms exploiting the power of quantum annealers. Here we present
a model predictive control (MPC) algorithm using a quantum annealer for a
system allowing a finite number of input values. Such an MPC problem is
classified as a non-deterministic polynomial-time-hard combinatorial problem,
and thus real-time sequential optimization is difficult to obtain with
conventional computational systems. We circumvent this difficulty by converting
the original MPC problem into a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization
problem, which is then solved by the D-Wave quantum annealer. Two practical
applications, namely stabilization of a spring-mass-damper system and dynamic
audio quantization, are demonstrated. For both, the D-Wave method exhibits
better performance than the classical simulated annealing method. Our results
suggest new applications of quantum annealers in the direction of dynamic
control problems.
"
1782,Design of optical neural networks with component imprecisions,"  For the benefit of designing scalable, fault resistant optical neural
networks (ONNs), we investigate the effects architectural designs have on the
ONNs' robustness to imprecise components. We train two ONNs -- one with a more
tunable design (GridNet) and one with better fault tolerance (FFTNet) -- to
classify handwritten digits. When simulated without any imperfections, GridNet
yields a better accuracy (~98%) than FFTNet (~95%). However, under a small
amount of error in their photonic components, the more fault tolerant FFTNet
overtakes GridNet. We further provide thorough quantitative and qualitative
analyses of ONNs' sensitivity to varying levels and types of imprecisions. Our
results offer guidelines for the principled design of fault-tolerant ONNs as
well as a foundation for further research.
"
1783,"Switching dynamics of single and coupled VO2-based oscillators as
  elements of neural networks","  In the present paper, we report on the switching dynamics of both single and
coupled VO2-based oscillators, with resistive and capacitive coupling, and
explore the capability of their application in oscillatory neural networks.
Based on these results, we further select an adequate SPICE model to describe
the modes of operation of coupled oscillator circuits. Physical mechanisms
influencing the time of forward and reverse electrical switching, that
determine the applicability limits of the proposed model, are identified. For
the resistive coupling, it is shown that synchronization takes place at a
certain value of the coupling resistance, though it is unstable and a
synchronization failure occurs periodically. For the capacitive coupling, two
synchronization modes, with weak and strong coupling, are found. The transition
between these modes is accompanied by chaotic oscillations. A decrease in the
width of the spectrum harmonics in the weak-coupling mode, and its increase in
the strong-coupling one, is detected. The dependences of frequencies and phase
differences of the coupled oscillatory circuits on the coupling capacitance are
found. Examples of operation of coupled VO2 oscillators as a central pattern
generator are demonstrated.
"
1784,Data Structure Primitives on Persistent Memory: An Evaluation,"  Persistent Memory (PMem), as already available, e.g., with Intel Optane DC
Persistent Memory, represents a very promising, next-generation memory solution
with a significant impact on database architectures. Several data structures
for this new technology and its properties have already been proposed. However,
primarily only complete structures are presented and evaluated. Thus, the
implications of the individual ideas and PMem features are concealed.
Therefore, in this paper, we disassemble the structures presented so far,
identify their underlying design primitives, and assign them to appropriate
design goals regarding PMem. As a result of our comprehensive experiments on
real PM hardware, we can reveal the trade-offs of the primitives for various
access patterns. This allowed us to pinpoint their best use cases as well as
vulnerabilities. Besides our general insights regarding PMem-based data
structure design, we also discovered new combinations not examined in the
literature so far.
"
1785,"Software Mitigation of Crosstalk on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum
  Computers","  Crosstalk is a major source of noise in Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum
(NISQ) systems and is a fundamental challenge for hardware design. When
multiple instructions are executed in parallel, crosstalk between the
instructions can corrupt the quantum state and lead to incorrect program
execution. Our goal is to mitigate the application impact of crosstalk noise
through software techniques. This requires (i) accurate characterization of
hardware crosstalk, and (ii) intelligent instruction scheduling to serialize
the affected operations. Since crosstalk characterization is computationally
expensive, we develop optimizations which reduce the characterization overhead.
On three 20-qubit IBMQ systems, we demonstrate two orders of magnitude
reduction in characterization time (compute time on the QC device) compared to
all-pairs crosstalk measurements. Informed by these characterization, we
develop a scheduler that judiciously serializes high crosstalk instructions
balancing the need to mitigate crosstalk and exponential decoherence errors
from serialization. On real-system runs on three IBMQ systems, our scheduler
improves the error rate of application circuits by up to 5.6x, compared to the
IBM instruction scheduler and offers near-optimal crosstalk mitigation in
practice.
  In a broader picture, the difficulty of mitigating crosstalk has recently
driven QC vendors to move towards sparser qubit connectivity or disabling
nearby operations entirely in hardware, which can be detrimental to
performance. Our work makes the case for software mitigation of crosstalk
errors.
"
1786,Optimizing the Write Fidelity of MRAMs,"  Magnetic random-access memory (MRAM) is a promising memory technology due to
its high density, non-volatility, and high endurance. However, achieving high
memory fidelity incurs significant write-energy costs, which should be reduced
for large-scale deployment of MRAMs. In this paper, we formulate an
optimization problem for maximizing the memory fidelity given energy
constraints, and propose a biconvex optimization approach to solve it. The
basic idea is to allocate non-uniform write pulses depending on the importance
of each bit position. The fidelity measure we consider is minimum mean squared
error (MSE), for which we propose an iterative water-filling algorithm.
Although the iterative algorithm does not guarantee global optimality, we can
choose a proper starting point that decreases the MSE exponentially and
guarantees fast convergence. For an 8-bit accessed word, the proposed algorithm
reduces the MSE by a factor of 21.
"
1787,"TunnelScatter: Low Power Communication for Sensor Tags using Tunnel
  Diodes","  Due to extremely low power consumption, backscatter has become the
transmission mechanism of choice for battery-free devices that operate on
harvested energy. However, a limitation of recent backscatter systems is that
the communication range scales with the strength of the ambient carrier
signal(ACS). This means that to achieve a long range, a backscatter tag needs
to reflect a strong ACS, which in practice means that it needs to be close to
an ACS emitter. We present TunnelScatter, a mechanism that overcomes this
limitation. TunnelScatter uses a tunnel diode-based radio frequency oscillator
to enable transmissions when there is no ACS, and the same oscillator as a
reflection amplifier to support backscatter transmissions when the ACS is weak.
Our results show that even without an ACS, TunnelScatter is able to transmit
through several walls covering a distance of 18 meter while consuming a peak
biasing power of 57 microwatts. Based on TunnelScatter, we design battery-free
sensor tags, called TunnelTags, that can sense physical phenomena and transmit
them using the TunnelScatter mechanism.
"
1788,Reservoir computing for sensing: an experimental approach,"  The increasing popularity of machine learning solutions puts increasing
restrictions on this field if it is to penetrate more aspects of life. In
particular, energy efficiency and speed of operation is crucial, inter alia in
portable medical devices. The Reservoir Computing (RC) paradigm poses as a
solution to these issues through foundation of its operation: the reservoir of
states. Adequate separation of input information translated into the internal
state of the reservoir, whose connections do not need to be trained, allow to
simplify the readout layer thus significantly accelerating the operation of the
system. In this brief review article, the theoretical basis of RC was first
described, followed by a description of its individual variants, their
development and state-of-the-art applications in chemical sensing and
metrology: detection of impedance changes and ion sensing. Presented results
indicate applicability of reservoir computing for sensing and validating the
SWEET algorithm experimentally.
"
1789,"A quantum-classical cloud platform optimized for variational hybrid
  algorithms","  In order to support near-term applications of quantum computing, a new
compute paradigm has emerged--the quantum-classical cloud--in which quantum
computers (QPUs) work in tandem with classical computers (CPUs) via a shared
cloud infrastructure. In this work, we enumerate the architectural requirements
of a quantum-classical cloud platform, and present a framework for benchmarking
its runtime performance. In addition, we walk through two platform-level
enhancements, parametric compilation and active qubit reset, that specifically
optimize a quantum-classical architecture to support variational hybrid
algorithms (VHAs), the most promising applications of near-term quantum
hardware. Finally, we show that integrating these two features into the Rigetti
Quantum Cloud Services (QCS) platform results in considerable improvements to
the latencies that govern algorithm runtime.
"
1790,On the Computational Viability of Quantum Optimization for PMU Placement,"  Using optimal phasor measurement unit placement as a prototypical problem, we
assess the computational viability of the current generation D-Wave Systems
2000Q quantum annealer for power systems design problems. We reformulate
minimum dominating set for the annealer hardware, solve the reformulation for a
standard set of IEEE test systems, and benchmark solution quality and time to
solution against the CPLEX Optimizer and simulated annealing. For some problem
instances the 2000Q outpaces CPLEX. For instances where the 2000Q underperforms
with respect to CPLEX and simulated annealing, we suggest hardware improvements
for the next generation of quantum annealers.
"
1791,"Survey on STT-MRAM Testing: Failure Mechanisms, Fault Models, and Tests","  As one of the most promising emerging non-volatile memory (NVM) technologies,
spin-transfer torque magnetic random access memory (STT-MRAM) has attracted
significant research attention due to several features such as high density,
zero standby leakage, and nearly unlimited endurance. However, a high-quality
test solution is required prior to the commercialization of STT-MRAM. In this
paper, we present all STT-MRAM failure mechanisms: manufacturing defects,
extreme process variations, magnetic coupling, STT-switching stochasticity, and
thermal fluctuation. The resultant fault models including permanent faults and
transient faults are classified and discussed. Moreover, the limited test
algorithms and design-for-testability (DfT) designs proposed in the literature
are also covered. It is clear that test solutions for STT-MRAMs are far from
well established yet, especially when considering a defective part per billion
(DPPB) level requirement. We present the main challenges on the STT-MRAM
testing topic at three levels: failure mechanisms, fault modeling, and test/DfT
designs.
"
1792,NbO2-based memristive neurons for burst-based perceptron,"  Neuromorphic computing using spike-based learning has broad prospects in
reducing computing power. Memristive neurons composed with two locally active
memristors have been used to mimic the dynamical behaviors of biological
neurons. In this work, the dynamic operating conditions of NbO2-based
memristive neurons and their transformation boundaries between the spiking and
the bursting are comprehensively investigated. Furthermore, the underlying
mechanism of bursting is analyzed and the controllability of the number of
spikes during each burst period is demonstrated. Finally, pattern
classification and information transmitting in a perceptron neural network by
using the number of spikes per bursting period to encode information is
proposed. The results show a promising approach for the practical
implementation of neuristor in spiking neural networks.
"
1793,"A back-end, CMOS compatible ferroelectric Field Effect Transistor for
  synaptic weights","  Neuromorphic computing architectures enable the dense co-location of memory
and processing elements within a single circuit. This co-location removes the
communication bottleneck of transferring data between separate memory and
computing units as in standard von Neuman architectures for data-critical
applications including machine learning. The essential building blocks of
neuromorphic systems are non-volatile synaptic elements such as memristors. Key
memristor properties include a suitable non-volatile resistance range,
continuous linear resistance modulation and symmetric switching. In this work,
we demonstrate voltage-controlled, symmetric and analog potentiation and
depression of a ferroelectric Hf$_{57}$Zr$_{43}$O$_{2}$ (HZO) field effect
transistor (FeFET) with good linearity. Our FeFET operates with a low writing
energy (fJ) and fast programming time (40 ns). Retention measurements have been
done over 4-bits depth with low noise (1%) in the tungsten oxide (WO$_{x}$)
read out channel. By adjusting the channel thickness from 15nm to 8nm, the
on/off ratio of the FeFET can be engineered from 1% to 200% with an
on-resistance ideally >100 kOhm, depending on the channel geometry. The device
concept is using earth-abundant materials, and is compatible with a back end of
line (BEOL) integration into complementary metal-oxidesemiconductor (CMOS)
processes. It has therefore a great potential for the fabrication of high
density, large-scale integrated arrays of artificial analog synapses.
"
1794,"Context-Sensitive and Duration-Aware Qubit Mapping for Various NISQ
  Devices","  Quantum computing (QC) technologies have reached a second renaissance in the
last decade. Some fully programmable QC devices have been built based on
superconducting or ion trap technologies. Although different quantum
technologies have their own parameter indicators, QC devices in the NISQ era
share common features and challenges such as limited qubits and connectivity,
short coherence time and high gate error rates. Quantum programs written by
programmers could hardly run on real hardware directly since two-qubit gates
are usually allowed on few pairs of qubits. Therefore, quantum computing
compilers must resolve the mapping problem and transform original programs to
fit the hardware limitation. To address the issues mentioned above, we
summarize different quantum technologies and abstractly define Quantum Abstract
Machine (QAM); then propose a COntext-sensitive and Duration-Aware Remapping
algorithm (Codar) based on the QAM. By introducing lock for each qubit, Codar
is aware of gate duration difference and program context, which bring it
abilities to extract more program's parallelism and reduce program execution
time. Compared to the best-known algorithm, Codar halves the total execution
time of several quantum algorithms and cut down 17.5% - 19.4% total execution
time on average in different architectures.

1795,Memristor Hardware-Friendly Reinforcement Learning,"  Recently, significant progress has been made in solving sophisticated
problems among various domains by using reinforcement learning (RL), which
allows machines or agents to learn from interactions with environments rather
than explicit supervision. As the end of Moore's law seems to be imminent,
emerging technologies that enable high performance neuromorphic hardware
systems are attracting increasing attention. Namely, neuromorphic architectures
that leverage memristors, the programmable and nonvolatile two-terminal
devices, as synaptic weights in hardware neural networks, are candidates of
choice to realize such highly energy-efficient and complex nervous systems.
However, one of the challenges for memristive hardware with integrated learning
capabilities is prohibitively large number of write cycles that might be
required during learning process, and this situation is even exacerbated under
RL situations. In this work we propose a memristive neuromorphic hardware
implementation for the actor-critic algorithm in RL. By introducing a two-fold
training procedure (i.e., ex-situ pre-training and in-situ re-training) and
several training techniques, the number of weight updates can be significantly
reduced and thus it will be suitable for efficient in-situ learning
implementations. As a case study, we consider the task of balancing an inverted
pendulum, a classical problem in both RL and control theory. We believe that
this study shows the promise of using memristor-based hardware neural networks
for handling complex tasks through in-situ reinforcement learning.

1796,"Hardware Security for and beyond CMOS Technology: An Overview on
  Fundamentals, Applications, and Challenges","  As with most aspects of electronic systems and integrated circuits, hardware
security has traditionally evolved around the dominant CMOS technology.
However, with the rise of various emerging technologies, whose main purpose is
to overcome the fundamental limitations for scaling and power consumption of
CMOS technology, unique opportunities arise also to advance the notion of
hardware security. In this paper, I first provide an overview on hardware
security in general. Next, I review selected emerging technologies, namely (i)
spintronics, (ii) memristors, (iii) carbon nanotubes and related transistors,
(iv) nanowires and related transistors, and (v) 3D and 2.5D integration. I then
discuss their application to advance hardware security and also outline related
challenges.
"
1797,Reliable and Energy Efficient MLC STT-RAM Buffer for CNN Accelerators,"  We propose a lightweight scheme where the formation of a data block is
changed in such a way that it can tolerate soft errors significantly better
than the baseline. The key insight behind our work is that CNN weights are
normalized between -1 and 1 after each convolutional layer, and this leaves one
bit unused in half-precision floating-point representation. By taking advantage
of the unused bit, we create a backup for the most significant bit to protect
it against the soft errors. Also, considering the fact that in MLC STT-RAMs the
cost of memory operations (read and write), and reliability of a cell are
content-dependent (some patterns take larger current and longer time, while
they are more susceptible to soft error), we rearrange the data block to
minimize the number of costly bit patterns. Combining these two techniques
provides the same level of accuracy compared to an error-free baseline while
improving the read and write energy by 9% and 6%, respectively.
"
1798,"Intelligent Reflecting Surface-Assisted Multiple Access with User
  Pairing: NOMA or OMA?","  The integration of intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) to multiple access
networks is a cost-effective solution for boosting spectrum/energy efficiency
and enlarging network coverage/connections. However, due to the new capability
of IRS in reconfiguring the wireless propagation channels, it is fundamentally
unknown which multiple access scheme is superior in the IRS-assisted wireless
network. In this letter, we pursue a theoretical performance comparison between
non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and orthogonal multiple access (OMA) in
the IRS-assisted downlink communication, for which the transmit power
minimization problems are formulated under the discrete unit-modulus reflection
constraint on each IRS element. We analyze the minimum transmit powers required
by different multiple access schemes and compare them numerically, which turn
out to not fully comply with the stereotyped superiority of NOMA over OMA in
conventional systems without IRS. Moreover, to avoid the exponential complexity
of the brute-force search for the optimal discrete IRS phase shifts, we propose
a low-complexity solution to achieve near-optimal performance.
"
1799,"Large-Scale Optical Reservoir Computing for Spatiotemporal Chaotic
  Systems Prediction","  Reservoir computing is a relatively recent computational paradigm that
originates from a recurrent neural network, and is known for its wide-range of
implementations using different physical technologies. Large reservoirs are
very hard to obtain in conventional computers as both the computation
complexity and memory usage grows quadratically. We propose an optical scheme
performing reservoir computing over very large networks of up to $10^6$ fully
connected photonic nodes thanks to its intrinsic properties of parallelism. Our
experimental studies confirm that in contrast to conventional computers, the
computation time of our optical scheme is only linearly dependent on the number
of photonic nodes of the network, which is due to electronic overheads, while
the optical part of computation remains fully parallel and independent of the
reservoir size. To demonstrate the scalability of our optical scheme, we
perform for the first time predictions on large multidimensional chaotic
datasets using the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation as an example of a
spatiotemporal chaotic system. Our results are extremely challenging for
conventional Turing-von Neumann machines, and they significantly advance the
state-of-the-art of unconventional reservoir computing approaches in general.
"
1800,"Bio-mimetic Synaptic Plasticity and Learning in a sub-500mV Cu/SiO$_2$/W
  Memristor","  The computational efficiency of the human brain is believed to stem from the
parallel information processing capability of neurons with integrated storage
in synaptic interconnections programmed by local spike triggered learning rules
such as spike timing dependent plasticity (STDP). The extremely low operating
voltages (approximately $100\,$mV) used to trigger neuronal signaling and
synaptic adaptation is believed to be a critical reason for the brain's power
efficiency. We demonstrate the feasibility of spike triggered STDP behavior in
a two-terminal Cu/SiO$_2$/W memristive device capable of operating below
$500\,$mV. We analyze the state-dependent nature of conductance updates in the
device to develop a phenomenological model. Using the model, we evaluate the
potential of such devices to generate precise spike times under supervised
learning conditions and classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset in
an unsupervised learning setting. The results form a promising step towards
creating a low power synaptic device capable of on-chip learning.
"
1801,Improved quantum circuits for elliptic curve discrete logarithms,"  We present improved quantum circuits for elliptic curve scalar
multiplication, the most costly component in Shor's algorithm to compute
discrete logarithms in elliptic curve groups. We optimize low-level components
such as reversible integer and modular arithmetic through windowing techniques
and more adaptive placement of uncomputing steps, and improve over previous
quantum circuits for modular inversion by reformulating the binary Euclidean
algorithm. Overall, we obtain an affine Weierstrass point addition circuit that
has lower depth and uses fewer $T$ gates than previous circuits. While previous
work mostly focuses on minimizing the total number of qubits, we present
various trade-offs between different cost metrics including the number of
qubits, circuit depth and $T$-gate count. Finally, we provide a full
implementation of point addition in the Q# quantum programming language that
allows unit tests and automatic quantum resource estimation for all components.
"
1802,Photonic Realization of a Quantum Finite Automaton,"  We describe a physical implementation of a quantum finite automaton
recognizing a well known family of periodic languages. The realization exploits
the polarization degree of freedom of single photons and their manipulation
through linear optical elements. We use techniques of confidence amplification
to reduce the acceptance error probability of the automaton. It is worth
remarking that the quantum finite automaton we physically realize is not only
interesting per se, but it turns out to be a crucial building block in many
quantum finite automaton design frameworks theoretically settled in the
literature.
"
1803,"Analytical Modeling of the Path-Loss for Reconfigurable Intelligent
  Surfaces -- Anomalous Mirror or Scatterer ?","  Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) are an emerging field of research
in wireless communications. A fundamental component for analyzing and
optimizing RIS-empowered wireless networks is the development of simple but
sufficiently accurate models for the power scattered by an RIS. By leveraging
the general scalar theory of diffraction and the Huygens-Fresnel principle, we
introduce simple formulas for the electric field scattered by an RIS that is
modeled as a sheet of electromagnetic material of negligible thickness. The
proposed approach allows us to identify the conditions under which an RIS of
finite size can or cannot be approximated as an anomalous mirror. Numerical
results are illustrated to confirm the proposed approach.
"
1804,Is Your Quantum Program Bug-Free?,"  Quantum computers are becoming more mainstream. As more programmers are
starting to look at writing quantum programs, they face an inevitable task of
debugging their code. How should the programs for quantum computers be
debugged? In this paper, we discuss existing debugging tactics, used in
developing programs for classic computers, and show which ones can be readily
adopted. We also highlight quantum-computer-specific debugging issues and list
novel techniques that are needed to address these issues. The practitioners can
readily apply some of these tactics to their process of writing quantum
programs, while researchers can learn about opportunities for future work.
"
1805,Structure-based Computer Without Using Transistors,"  The commercialization of transistors capable of both switching and
amplification in 1960 resulted in the development of second-generation
computers, which resulted in the miniaturization and lightening, while
accelerating the reduction and development of production costs. However, the
self-resistance and the resistance used in conjunction with semiconductors,
which are the basic principles of computers, generate a lot of heat, which
results in semiconductor obsolescence, and limits the computation speed (Clock
rate). In implementing logic operation, this paper proposes the concept of
Structure-based Computer which can implement NOT gate made of semiconductor
transistor only by Structure-based twist of cable without resistance. In
Structure-based computer, the theory of 'inverse signal pair' of digital
signals was introduced so that it could operate in a different way than
semiconductor-based transistors. In this paper, we propose a new hardware
called Structure-based computer that can solve various problems in
semiconductor computers only with the wiring structure of the conductor itself,
not with the silicon-based semiconductor. A USB-type Structure-based computer
prototype has been built, and a logical cloning method using CPU Clock is
proposed to avoid the risk of current being reversed by cloning logical values.
Furthermore, we propose a deep-priority exploration-based simulation method
that can easily implement and test complex Structure-based computer circuits.
Furthermore, this paper suggests a mechanism to implement optical computers
currently under development and research based on structures rather than
devices.
"
1806,"In-situ learning harnessing intrinsic resistive memory variability
  through Markov Chain Monte Carlo Sampling","  Resistive memory technologies promise to be a key component in unlocking the
next generation of intelligent in-memory computing systems that can act and
learn locally at the edge. However, current approaches to in-memory machine
learning focus often on the implementation of models and algorithms which
cannot be reconciled with the true, physical properties of resistive memory.
Consequently, these properties, in particular cycle-to-cycle conductance
variability, are considered as non-idealities that require mitigation. Here by
contrast, we embrace these properties by selecting a more appropriate machine
learning model and algorithm. We implement a Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling
algorithm within a fabricated array of 16,384 devices, configured as a Bayesian
machine learning model. The algorithm is realised in-situ, by exploiting the
devices as random variables from the perspective of their cycle-to-cycle
conductance variability. We train experimentally the memory array to perform an
illustrative supervised learning task as well as a malignant breast tissue
recognition task, achieving an accuracy of 96.3%. Then, using a behavioural
model of resistive memory calibrated on array level measurements, we apply the
same approach to the Cartpole reinforcement learning task. In all cases our
proposed approach outperformed software-based neural network models realised
using an equivalent number of memory elements. This result lays a foundation
for a new path in-memory machine learning, compatible with the true properties
of resistive memory technologies, that can bring localised learning
capabilities to intelligent edge computing systems.
"
1807,Mixed-precision deep learning based on computational memory,"  Deep neural networks (DNNs) have revolutionized the field of artificial
intelligence and have achieved unprecedented success in cognitive tasks such as
image and speech recognition. Training of large DNNs, however, is
computationally intensive and this has motivated the search for novel computing
architectures targeting this application. A computational memory unit with
nanoscale resistive memory devices organized in crossbar arrays could store the
synaptic weights in their conductance states and perform the expensive weighted
summations in place in a non-von Neumann manner. However, updating the
conductance states in a reliable manner during the weight update process is a
fundamental challenge that limits the training accuracy of such an
implementation. Here, we propose a mixed-precision architecture that combines a
computational memory unit performing the weighted summations and imprecise
conductance updates with a digital processing unit that accumulates the weight
updates in high precision. A combined hardware/software training experiment of
a multilayer perceptron based on the proposed architecture using a phase-change
memory (PCM) array achieves 97.73% test accuracy on the task of classifying
handwritten digits (based on the MNIST dataset), within 0.6% of the software
baseline. The architecture is further evaluated using accurate behavioral
models of PCM on a wide class of networks, namely convolutional neural
networks, long-short-term-memory networks, and generative-adversarial networks.
Accuracies comparable to those of floating-point implementations are achieved
without being constrained by the non-idealities associated with the PCM
devices. A system-level study demonstrates 173x improvement in energy
efficiency of the architecture when used for training a multilayer perceptron
compared with a dedicated fully digital 32-bit implementation.
"
1808,"Statistical Tests and Confidential Intervals as Thresholds for Quantum
  Neural Networks","  Some basic quantum neural networks were analyzed and constructed in the
recent work of the author \cite{dndiep3}, published in International Journal of
Theoretical Physics (2020). In particular the Least Quare Problem (LSP) and the
Linear Regression Problem (LRP) was discussed. In this second paper we continue
to analyze and construct the least square quantum neural network (LS-QNN), the
polynomial interpolation quantum neural network (PI-QNN), the polynomial
regression quantum neural network (PR-QNN) and chi-squared quantum neural
network ($\chi^2$-QNN). We use the corresponding solution or tests as the
threshold for the corresponding training rules.
"
1809,"A Hybrid Quantum enabled RBM Advantage: Convolutional Autoencoders For
  Quantum Image Compression and Generative Learning","  Understanding how the D-Wave quantum computer could be used for machine
learning problems is of growing interest. Our work evaluates the feasibility of
using the D-Wave as a sampler for machine learning. We describe a hybrid system
that combines a classical deep neural network autoencoder with a quantum
annealing Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) using the D-Wave. We evaluate our
hybrid autoencoder algorithm using two datasets, the MNIST dataset and MNIST
Fashion dataset. We evaluate the quality of this method by using a downstream
classification method where the training is based on quantum RBM-generated
samples. Our method overcomes two key limitations in the current 2000-qubit
D-Wave processor, namely the limited number of qubits available to accommodate
typical problem sizes for fully connected quantum objective functions and
samples that are binary pixel representations. As a consequence of these
limitations we are able to show how we achieved nearly a 22-fold compression
factor of grayscale 28 x 28 sized images to binary 6 x 6 sized images with a
lossy recovery of the original 28 x 28 grayscale images. We further show how
generating samples from the D-Wave after training the RBM, resulted in 28 x 28
images that were variations of the original input data distribution, as opposed
to recreating the training samples. We formulated an MNIST classification
problem using a deep convolutional neural network that used samples from a
quantum RBM to train the MNIST classifier and compared the results with an
MNIST classifier trained with the original MNIST training data set, as well as
an MNIST classifier trained using classical RBM samples. Our hybrid autoencoder
approach indicates advantage for RBM results relative to the use of a current
RBM classical computer implementation for image-based machine learning and even
more promising results for the next generation D-Wave quantum system.

1810,Parallel convolution processing using an integrated photonic tensor core,"  With the proliferation of ultra-high-speed mobile networks and
internet-connected devices, along with the rise of artificial intelligence, the
world is generating exponentially increasing amounts of data - data that needs
to be processed in a fast, efficient and smart way. These developments are
pushing the limits of existing computing paradigms, and highly parallelized,
fast and scalable hardware concepts are becoming progressively more important.
Here, we demonstrate a computational specific integrated photonic tensor core -
the optical analog of an ASIC-capable of operating at Tera-Multiply-Accumulate
per second (TMAC/s) speeds. The photonic core achieves parallelized photonic
in-memory computing using phase-change memory arrays and photonic chip-based
optical frequency combs (soliton microcombs). The computation is reduced to
measuring the optical transmission of reconfigurable and non-resonant passive
components and can operate at a bandwidth exceeding 14 GHz, limited only by the
speed of the modulators and photodetectors. Given recent advances in hybrid
integration of soliton microcombs at microwave line rates, ultra-low loss
silicon nitride waveguides, and high speed on-chip detectors and modulators,
our approach provides a path towards full CMOS wafer-scale integration of the
photonic tensor core. While we focus on convolution processing, more generally
our results indicate the major potential of integrated photonics for parallel,
fast, and efficient computational hardware in demanding AI applications such as
autonomous driving, live video processing, and next generation cloud computing
services.
"
1811,Optimum multiplexer design in quantum-dot cellular automata,"  Quantum-dot Cellular Automata (QCA) is one of the most important computing
technologies for the future and will be the alternative candidate for current
CMOS technology. QCA is attracting a lot of researchers due to many features
such as high speed, small size, and low power consumption. QCA has two main
building blocks (majority gate and inverter) used for design any Boolean
function. QCA also has an inherent capability that used to design many
important gates such as XOR and Multiplexer in optimal form without following
any Boolean function. This paper presents a novel design 2:1 QCA-Multiplexer in
two forms. The proposed design is very simple, highly efficient and can be used
to produce many logical functions. The proposed design output comes from the
inherent capabilities of quantum technology. New 4:1 QCA-Multiplexer has been
built using the proposed structure. The output waveforms showed the wonderful
performance of the proposed design in terms of the number of cells, area, and
latency.
"
1812,CMOS-Free Multilayer Perceptron Enabled by Four-Terminal MTJ Device,"  Neuromorphic computing promises revolutionary improvements over conventional
systems for applications that process unstructured information. To fully
realize this potential, neuromorphic systems should exploit the biomimetic
behavior of emerging nanodevices. In particular, exceptional opportunities are
provided by the non-volatility and analog capabilities of spintronic devices.
While spintronic devices have previously been proposed that emulate neurons and
synapses, complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) devices are required
to implement multilayer spintronic perceptron crossbars. This work therefore
proposes a new spintronic neuron that enables purely spintronic multilayer
perceptrons, eliminating the need for CMOS circuitry and simplifying
fabrication.
"
1813,"Modular Simulation Framework for Process Variation Analysis of
  MRAM-based Deep Belief Networks","  Magnetic Random-Access Memory (MRAM) based p-bit neuromorphic computing
devices are garnering increasing interest as a means to compactly and
efficiently realize machine learning operations in Restricted Boltzmann
Machines (RBMs). When embedded within an RBM resistive crossbar array, the
p-bit based neuron realizes a tunable sigmoidal activation function. Since the
stochasticity of activation is dependent on the energy barrier of the MRAM
device, it is essential to assess the impact of process variation on the
voltage-dependent behavior of the sigmoid function. Other influential
performance factors arise from varying energy barriers on power consumption
requiring a simulation environment to facilitate the multi-objective
optimization of device and network parameters. Herein, transportable Python
scripts are developed to analyze the output variation under changes in device
dimensions on the accuracy of machine learning applications. Evaluation with
RBM circuits using the MNIST dataset reveal impacts and limits for processing
variation of device fabrication in terms of the resulting energy vs. accuracy
tradeoffs, and the resulting simulation framework is available via a Creative
Commons license.
"
1814,"Towards Explainable Bit Error Tolerance of Resistive RAM-Based Binarized
  Neural Networks","  Non-volatile memory, such as resistive RAM (RRAM), is an emerging
energy-efficient storage, especially for low-power machine learning models on
the edge. It is reported, however, that the bit error rate of RRAMs can be up
to 3.3% in the ultra low-power setting, which might be crucial for many use
cases. Binary neural networks (BNNs), a resource efficient variant of neural
networks (NNs), can tolerate a certain percentage of errors without a loss in
accuracy and demand lower resources in computation and storage. The bit error
tolerance (BET) in BNNs can be achieved by flipping the weight signs during
training, as proposed by Hirtzlin et al., but their method has a significant
drawback, especially for fully connected neural networks (FCNN): The FCNNs
overfit to the error rate used in training, which leads to low accuracy under
lower error rates. In addition, the underlying principles of BET are not
investigated. In this work, we improve the training for BET of BNNs and aim to
explain this property. We propose straight-through gradient approximation to
improve the weight-sign-flip training, by which BNNs adapt less to the bit
error rates. To explain the achieved robustness, we define a metric that aims
to measure BET without fault injection. We evaluate the metric and find that it
correlates with accuracy over error rate for all FCNNs tested. Finally, we
explore the influence of a novel regularizer that optimizes with respect to
this metric, with the aim of providing a configurable trade-off in accuracy and
BET.
"
1815,"Accelerating Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm using Machine
  Learning","  We propose a machine learning based approach to accelerate quantum
approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) implementation which is a promising
quantum-classical hybrid algorithm to prove the so-called quantum supremacy. In
QAOA, a parametric quantum circuit and a classical optimizer iterates in a
closed loop to solve hard combinatorial optimization problems. The performance
of QAOA improves with increasing number of stages (depth) in the quantum
circuit. However, two new parameters are introduced with each added stage for
the classical optimizer increasing the number of optimization loop iterations.
We note a correlation among parameters of the lower-depth and the higher-depth
QAOA implementations and, exploit it by developing a machine learning model to
predict the gate parameters close to the optimal values. As a result, the
optimization loop converges in a fewer number of iterations. We choose graph
MaxCut problem as a prototype to solve using QAOA. We perform a feature
extraction routine using 100 different QAOA instances and develop a training
data-set with 13,860 optimal parameters. We present our analysis for 4 flavors
of regression models and 4 flavors of classical optimizers. Finally, we show
that the proposed approach can curtail the number of optimization iterations by
on average 44.9% (up to 65.7%) from an analysis performed with 264 flavors of
graphs.
"
1816,"Integrated Photonic FFT for Optical Convolutions towards Efficient and
  High-Speed Neural Networks","  The technologically-relevant task of feature extraction from data performed
in deep-learning systems is routinely accomplished as repeated fast Fourier
transforms (FFT) electronically in prevalent domain-specific architectures such
as in graphics processing units (GPUs). However, electronics systems are
limited with respect to power dissipation and delay, both, due to wire-charging
challenges related to interconnect capacitance. Here we present a silicon
photonics-based architecture for convolutional neural networks that harnesses
the phase property of light to perform FFTs efficiently by executing the
convolution as a multiplication in the Fourier-domain. The algorithmic
executing time is determined by the time-of-flight of the signal through this
photonic reconfigurable passive FFT filter circuit and is on the order of 10s
of picosecond. A sensitivity analysis shows that this optical processor must be
thermally phase stabilized corresponding to a few degrees. Furthermore, we find
that for a small sample number, the obtainable number of convolutions per
{time-power-chip area) outperforms GPUs by about 2 orders of magnitude. Lastly,
we show that, conceptually, the optical FFT and convolution-processing
performance is indeed directly linked to optoelectronic device-level, and
improvements in plasmonics, metamaterials or nanophotonics are fueling next
generation densely interconnected intelligent photonic circuits with relevance
for edge-computing 5G networks.
"
1817,"Multi-Objective Optimization for Size and Resilience of Spiking Neural
  Networks","  Inspired by the connectivity mechanisms in the brain, neuromorphic computing
architectures model Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) in silicon. As such,
neuromorphic architectures are designed and developed with the goal of having
small, low power chips that can perform control and machine learning tasks.
However, the power consumption of the developed hardware can greatly depend on
the size of the network that is being evaluated on the chip. Furthermore, the
accuracy of a trained SNN that is evaluated on chip can change due to voltage
and current variations in the hardware that perturb the learned weights of the
network. While efforts are made on the hardware side to minimize those
perturbations, a software based strategy to make the deployed networks more
resilient can help further alleviate that issue. In this work, we study Spiking
Neural Networks in two neuromorphic architecture implementations with the goal
of decreasing their size, while at the same time increasing their resiliency to
hardware faults. We leverage an evolutionary algorithm to train the SNNs and
propose a multiobjective fitness function to optimize the size and resiliency
of the SNN. We demonstrate that this strategy leads to well-performing,
small-sized networks that are more resilient to hardware faults.
"
1818,Hybrid Pass Transistor Logic with Ambipolar Transistors,"  In comparison to the conventional complementary pull-up and pull-down logic
structure, the pass transistor logic (PTL) family reduces the number of
transistors required to perform logic functions, thereby reducing both area and
power consumption. However, this logic family requires inter-stage inverters to
ensure signal integrity in cascaded logic circuits, and inverters must be used
to provide each logical input signal in its complementary form. These inverters
and complementary signals increase the device count and significantly degrade
overall system efficiency.
  Dual-gate ambipolar field-effect transistors natively provide a
single-transistor XNOR operation and permit highly-efficient and compact
circuits due to their ambipolar capabilities. Similar to PTL, logic circuits
based on ambipolar field-effect transistors require complementary signals.
Therefore, numerous inverters are required, with significant energy and area
costs.
  Ambipolar field-effect transistors are a natural match for PTL, as hybrid
ambipolar-PTL circuits can simultaneously use these inverters to satisfy their
necessity in both PTL and ambipolar circuits. We therefore propose a new hybrid
ambipolar-PTL logic family that exploits the compact logic of PTL and the
ambipolar capabilities of ambipolar field-effect transistors. Novel hybrid
ambipolar-PTL circuits were designed and simulated in SPICE, demonstrating
strong signal integrity along with the efficiency advantages of using the
required inverters to simultaneously satisfy the requirements of PTL and
ambipolar circuits. In comparison to the ambipolar field-effect transistors in
the conventional CMOS logic structure, our hybrid full adder circuit can reduce
propagation delay by 47%, energy consumption by 88%, energy-delay product by a
factor of 9, and area-energy-delay product by a factor of 20.

1819,Nonparametric Regression Quantum Neural Networks,"  In two pervious papers \cite{dndiep3}, \cite{dndiep4}, the first author
constructed the least square quantum neural networks (LS-QNN), and ploynomial
interpolation quantum neural networks ( PI-QNN), parametrico-stattistical QNN
like: leanr regrassion quantum neural networks (LR-QNN), polynomial regression
quantum neural networks (PR-QNN), chi-squared quantum neural netowrks
($\chi^2$-QNN). We observed that the method works also in the cases by using
nonparametric statistics. In this paper we analyze and implement the
nonparametric tests on QNN such as: linear nonparametric regression quantum
neural networks (LNR-QNN), polynomial nonparametric regression quantum neural
networks (PNR-QNN). The implementation is constructed through the Gauss-Jordan
Elimination quantum neural networks (GJE-QNN).The training rule is to use the
high probability confidence regions or intervals.

1820,"The Investigation of Negative Capacitance Vertical Nanowire FETs Based
  on SPICE Model at Device-Circuit Level","  In this study, a SPICE model for negative capacitance vertical nanowire
field-effect-transistor (NC VNW-FET) based on BSIM-CMG model and
Landau-Khalatnikov (LK) equation was presented. Suffering from the limitation
of short gate length there is lack of controllable and integrative structures
for high performance NC VNW-FETs. A new kind of structure was proposed for NC
VNW-FETs at sub-3nm node. Moreover, in order to understand and improve NC
VNW-FETs, the S-shaped polarization-voltage curve (S-curve) was divided into
four regions and some new design rules were proposed. By using the SPICE model,
device-circuit co-optimization was implemented. The co-design of gate work
function (WF) and NC was investigated. A ring oscillator was simulated to
analyze the circuit energy-delay, and it shown that significant energy
reduction, up to 88%, at iso-delay for NC VNW-FETs at low supply voltage can be
achieved. This study gives a credible method to analysis the performance of NC
based devices and circuits and reveals the potential of NC VNW-FETs in
low-power applications.
"
1821,"Hardware and software co-optimization for the initialization failure of
  the ReRAM based cross-bar array","  Recent advances in deep neural network demand more than millions of
parameters to handle and mandate the high-performance computing resources with
improved efficiency. The cross-bar array architecture has been considered as
one of the promising deep learning architectures that shows a significant
computing gain over the conventional processors. To investigate the feasibility
of the architecture, we examine non-idealities and their impact on the
performance. Specifically, we study the impact of failed cells due to the
initialization process of the resistive memory based cross-bar array. Unlike
the conventional memory array, individual memory elements cannot be rerouted
and, thus, may have a critical impact on model accuracy. We categorize the
possible failures and propose hardware implementation that minimizes
catastrophic failures. Such hardware optimization bounds the possible logical
value of the failed cells and gives us opportunities to compensate for the loss
of accuracy via off-line training. By introducing the random weight defects
during the training, we show that the model becomes more resilient on the
device initialization failures, therefore, less prone to degrade the inference
performance due to the failed devices. Our study sheds light on the hardware
and software co-optimization procedure to cope with potentially catastrophic
failures in the cross-bar array.
"
1822,A Scalable Photonic Computer Solving the Subset Sum Problem,"  The subset sum problem is a typical NP-complete problem that is hard to solve
efficiently in time due to the intrinsic superpolynomial-scaling property.
Increasing the problem size results in a vast amount of time consuming in
conventionally available computers. Photons possess the unique features of
extremely high propagation speed, weak interaction with environment and low
detectable energy level, therefore can be a promising candidate to meet the
challenge by constructing an a photonic computer computer. However, most of
optical computing schemes, like Fourier transformation, require very high
operation precision and are hard to scale up. Here, we present a chip built-in
photonic computer to efficiently solve the subset sum problem. We successfully
map the problem into a waveguide network in three dimensions by using
femtosecond laser direct writing technique. We show that the photons are able
to sufficiently dissipate into the networks and search all the possible paths
for solutions in parallel. In the case of successive primes the proposed
approach exhibits a dominant superiority in time consumption even compared with
supercomputers. Our results confirm the ability of light to realize a
complicated computational function that is intractable with conventional
computers, and suggest the subset sum problem as a good benchmarking platform
for the race between photonic and conventional computers on the way towards
""photonic supremacy"".

1823,Unconventional Bio-Inspired Model for Design of Logic Gates,"  During the last years, a well studied biological substrate, namely Physarum
polycephalum, has been proven efficient on finding appropriate and efficient
solutions in hard to solve complex mathematical problems. The plasmodium of P.
polycephalum is a single-cell that serves as a prosperous bio-computational
example. Consequently, it has been successfully utilized in the past to solve a
variety of path problems in graphs and combinatorial problems. In this work,
this interesting behaviour is mimicked by a robust unconventional computational
model, drawing inspiration from the notion of Cellular and Learning Automata.
Namely, we employ principles of Cellular Automata (CAs) enriched with learning
capabilities to develop a robust computational model, able of modelling
appropriately the aforementioned biological substrate and, thus, capturing its
computational capabilities. CAs are very efficient in modelling biological
systems and solving scientific problems, owing to their ability of incarnating
essential properties of a system where global behaviour arises as an effect of
simple components, interacting locally. The resulting computational tool, after
combining CAs with learning capabilities, should be appropriate for modelling
the behaviour of living organisms. Thus, the inherent abilities and
computational characteristics of the proposed bio-inspired model are stressed
towards the experimental verification of Physarum's ability to model Logic
Gates, while trying to find minimal paths in properly configured mazes with
food sources. The presented simulation results for various Logic Gates are
found in good agreement, both qualitatively and quantitatively, with the
corresponding experimental results, proving the efficacy of this unconventional
bio-inspired model and providing useful insights for its enhanced usage in
various computing applications.

1824,"Memristive oscillatory circuits for resolution of NP-complete logic
  puzzles: Sudoku case","  Memristor networks are capable of low-power and massive parallel processing
and information storage. Moreover, they have presented the ability to apply for
a vast number of intelligent data analysis applications targeting mobile edge
devices and low power computing. Beyond the memory and conventional computing
architectures, memristors are widely studied in circuits aiming for increased
intelligence that are suitable to tackle complex problems in a power and area
efficient manner, offering viable solutions oftenly arriving also from the
biological principles of living organisms. In this paper, a memristive circuit
exploiting the dynamics of oscillating networks is utilized for the resolution
of very popular and NP-complete logic puzzles, like the well-known ""Sudoku"".
More specifically, the proposed circuit design methodology allows for
appropriate usage of interconnections' advantages in a oscillation network and
of memristor's switching dynamics resulting to logic-solvable puzzle-instances.
The reduced complexity of the proposed circuit and its increased scalability
constitute its main advantage against previous approaches and the broadly
presented SPICE based simulations provide a clear proof of concept of the
aforementioned appealing characteristics.
"
1825,A Depth-Aware Swap Insertion Scheme for the Qubit Mapping Problem,"  The rapid progress of physical implementation of quantum computers paved the
way of realising the design of tools to help users write quantum programs for
any given quantum devices. The physical constraints inherent to the current
NISQ architectures prevent most quantum algorithms from being directly executed
on quantum devices. To enable two-qubit gates in the algorithm, existing works
focus on inserting SWAP gates to dynamically remap logical qubits to physical
qubits. However, their schemes lack the consideration of the depth of generated
quantum circuits. In this work, we propose a depth-aware SWAP insertion scheme
for qubit mapping problem in the NISQ era.
"
1826,"On the Complexity of the Cycles based Synthesis of Ternary Reversible
  Circuits","  The paper studies the main aspects of the realization of 2 x 2 ternary
reversible circuits based on cycles, considering the results of the realization
of all 362,880 2 x 2 ternary reversible functions. It has been shown that in
most cases, realizations obtained with the MMD+ algorithm have a lower
complexity (in terms of cost) than realizations based on cycles. In the paper
it is shown under which conditions realizations based on transpositions may
have a higher or a lower cost than realizations using larger cycles. Finally it
is shown that there are a few special cases where realizations based on
transpositions have the same cost or possibly lower cost than the MMD+ based
realizations. Aspects of scaleability are considered in terms of 2 x 2-based n
x n reversible circuits.
"
1827,Quantum Coupon Collector,"  We study how efficiently a $k$-element set $S\subseteq[n]$ can be learned
from a uniform superposition $|S\rangle$ of its elements. One can think of
$|S\rangle=\sum_{i\in S}|i\rangle/\sqrt{|S|}$ as the quantum version of a
uniformly random sample over $S$, as in the classical analysis of the ``coupon
collector problem.'' We show that if $k$ is close to $n$, then we can learn $S$
using asymptotically fewer quantum samples than random samples. In particular,
if there are $n-k=O(1)$ missing elements then $O(k)$ copies of $|S\rangle$
suffice, in contrast to the $\Theta(k\log k)$ random samples needed by a
classical coupon collector. On the other hand, if $n-k=\Omega(k)$, then
$\Omega(k\log k)$ quantum samples are~necessary.
  More generally, we give tight bounds on the number of quantum samples needed
for every $k$ and $n$, and we give efficient quantum learning algorithms. We
also give tight bounds in the model where we can additionally reflect through
$|S\rangle$. Finally, we relate coupon collection to a known example separating
proper and improper PAC learning that turns out to show no separation in the
quantum case.
"
1828,"In-materio neuromimetic devices: Dynamics, information processing and
  pattern recognition","  The story of information processing is a story of great success. Todays'
microprocessors are devices of unprecedented complexity and MOSFET transistors
are considered as the most widely produced artifact in the history of mankind.
The current miniaturization of electronic circuits is pushed almost to the
physical limit and begins to suffer from various parasitic effects. These facts
stimulate intense research on neuromimetic devices. This feature article is
devoted to various in materio implementation of neuromimetic processes,
including neuronal dynamics, synaptic plasticity, and higher-level signal and
information processing, along with more sophisticated implementations,
including signal processing, speech recognition and data security. Due to vast
number of papers in the field, only a subjective selection of topics is
presented in this review.
"
1829,Parallelising the Queries in Bucket Brigade Quantum RAM,"  Quantum algorithms often use quantum RAMs (QRAM) for accessing information
stored in a database-like manner. QRAMs have to be fast, resource efficient and
fault-tolerant. The latter is often influenced by access speeds, because
shorter times introduce less exposure of the stored information to noise. The
total execution time of an algorithm depends on the QRAM access time which
includes: 1) address translation time, and 2) effective query time. The bucket
brigade QRAMs were proposed to achieve faster addressing at the cost of
exponentially many ancillae. We illustrate a systematic method to significantly
reduce the effective query time by using Clifford+T gate parallelism. The
method does not introduce any ancillae qubits. Our parallelisation method is
compatible with the surface code quantum error correction. We show that
parallelisation is a result of advantageous Toffoli gate decomposition in terms
of Clifford+T gates, and after addresses have been translated, we achieve
theoretical $\mathcal{O}(1)$ parallelism for the effective queries. We conclude
that, in theory: 1) fault-tolerant bucket brigade quantum RAM queries can be
performed approximately with the speed of classical RAM; 2) the exponentially
many ancillae from the bucket brigade addressing scheme are a trade-off cost
for achieving exponential query speedup compared to quantum read-only memories
whose queries are sequential by design. The methods to compile, parallelise and
analyse the presented QRAM circuits were implemented in software which is
available online.
"
1830,On Boolean gates in fungal colony,"  A fungal colony maintains its integrity via flow of cytoplasm along mycelium
network. This flow, together with possible coordination of mycelium tips
propagation, is controlled by calcium waves and associated waves of electrical
potential changes. We propose that these excitation waves can be employed to
implement a computation in the mycelium networks. We use FitzHugh-Nagumo model
to imitate propagation of excitation in a single colony of Aspergillus niger.
Boolean values are encoded by spikes of extracellular potential. We represent
binary inputs by electrical impulses on a pair of selected electrodes and we
record responses of the colony from sixteen electrodes. We derive sets of
two-inputs-on-output logical gates implementable the fungal colony and analyse
distributions of the gates.
"
1831,Towards field-programmable photonic gate arrays,"  We review some of the basic principles, fundamentals, technologies,
architectures and recent advances leading to thefor the implementation of Field
Programmable Photonic Field Arrays (FPPGAs).
"
1832,"QEML (Quantum Enhanced Machine Learning): Using Quantum Computing to
  Enhance ML Classifiers and Feature Spaces","  Machine learning and quantum computing are two technologies that are causing
a paradigm shift in the performance and behavior of certain algorithms,
achieving previously unattainable results. Machine learning (kernel
classification) has become ubiquitous as the forefront method for pattern
recognition and has been shown to have numerous societal applications. While
not yet fault-tolerant, Quantum computing is an entirely new method of
computation due to its exploitation of quantum phenomena such as superposition
and entanglement. While current machine learning classifiers like the Support
Vector Machine are seeing gradual improvements in performance, there are still
severe limitations on the efficiency and scalability of such algorithms due to
a limited feature space which makes the kernel functions computationally
expensive to estimate. By integrating quantum circuits into traditional ML, we
may solve this problem through the use of quantum feature space, a technique
that improves existing Machine Learning algorithms through the use of
parallelization and the reduction of the storage space from exponential to
linear. This research expands on this concept of the Hilbert space and applies
it for classical machine learning by implementing the quantum-enhanced version
of the K nearest neighbors algorithm. This paper first understands the
mathematical intuition for the implementation of quantum feature space and
successfully simulates quantum properties and algorithms like Fidelity and
Grover's Algorithm via the Qiskit python library and the IBM Quantum Experience
platform. The primary experiment of this research is to build a noisy
variational quantum circuit KNN (QKNN) which mimics the classification methods
of a traditional KNN classifier. The QKNN utilizes the distance metric of
Hamming Distance and is able to outperform the existing KNN on a 10-dimensional
Breast Cancer dataset.
"
1833,Efficient Quantum Circuit Decompositions via Intermediate Qudits,"  Many quantum algorithms make use of ancilla, additional qubits used to store
temporary information during computation, to reduce the total execution time.
Quantum computers will be resource-constrained for years to come so reducing
ancilla requirements is crucial. In this work, we give a method to generate
ancilla out of idle qubits by placing some in higher-value states, called
qudits. We show how to take a circuit with many $O(n)$ ancilla and design an
ancilla-free circuit with the same asymptotic depth. Using this, we give a
circuit construction for an in-place adder and a constant adder both with
$O(\log n)$ depth using temporary qudits and no ancilla.
"
1834,"Non-Volatile Memory Array Based Quantization- and Noise-Resilient LSTM
  Neural Networks","  In cloud and edge computing models, it is important that compute devices at
the edge be as power efficient as possible. Long short-term memory (LSTM)
neural networks have been widely used for natural language processing, time
series prediction and many other sequential data tasks. Thus, for these
applications there is increasing need for low-power accelerators for LSTM model
inference at the edge. In order to reduce power dissipation due to data
transfers within inference devices, there has been significant interest in
accelerating vector-matrix multiplication (VMM) operations using non-volatile
memory (NVM) weight arrays. In NVM array-based hardware, reduced bit-widths
also significantly increases the power efficiency. In this paper, we focus on
the application of quantization-aware training algorithm to LSTM models, and
the benefits these models bring in terms of resilience against both
quantization error and analog device noise. We have shown that only 4-bit NVM
weights and 4-bit ADC/DACs are needed to produce equivalent LSTM network
performance as floating-point baseline. Reasonable levels of ADC quantization
noise and weight noise can be naturally tolerated within our NVMbased quantized
LSTM network. Benchmark analysis of our proposed LSTM accelerator for inference
has shown at least 2.4x better computing efficiency and 40x higher area
efficiency than traditional digital approaches (GPU, FPGA, and ASIC). Some
other novel approaches based on NVM promise to deliver higher computing
efficiency (up to 4.7x) but require larger arrays with potential higher error
rates.
"
1835,Planning for Compilation of a Quantum Algorithm for Graph Coloring,"  The problem of compiling general quantum algorithms for implementation on
near-term quantum processors has been introduced to the AI community. Previous
work demonstrated that temporal planning is an attractive approach for part of
this compilationtask, specifically, the routing of circuits that implement the
Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz (QAOA) applied to the MaxCut problem on a
quantum processor architecture. In this paper, we extend the earlier work to
route circuits that implement QAOA for Graph Coloring problems. QAOA for
coloring requires execution of more, and more complex, operations on the chip,
which makes routing a more challenging problem. We evaluate the approach on
state-of-the-art hardware architectures from leading quantum computing
companies. Additionally, we apply a planning approach to qubit initialization.
Our empirical evaluation shows that temporal planning compares well to
reasonable analytic upper bounds, and that solving qubit initialization with a
classical planner generally helps temporal planners in finding shorter-makespan
compilations for QAOA for Graph Coloring. These advances suggest that temporal
planning can be an effective approach for more complex quantum computing
algorithms and architectures.
"
1836,"sBSNN: Stochastic-Bits Enabled Binary Spiking Neural Network with
  On-Chip Learning for Energy Efficient Neuromorphic Computing at the Edge","  In this work, we propose stochastic Binary Spiking Neural Network (sBSNN)
composed of stochastic spiking neurons and binary synapses (stochastic only
during training) that computes probabilistically with one-bit precision for
power-efficient and memory-compressed neuromorphic computing. We present an
energy-efficient implementation of the proposed sBSNN using 'stochastic bit' as
the core computational primitive to realize the stochastic neurons and
synapses, which are fabricated in 90nm CMOS process, to achieve efficient
on-chip training and inference for image recognition tasks. The measured data
shows that the 'stochastic bit' can be programmed to mimic spiking neurons, and
stochastic Spike Timing Dependent Plasticity (or sSTDP) rule for training the
binary synaptic weights without expensive random number generators. Our results
indicate that the proposed sBSNN realization offers possibility of up to 32x
neuronal and synaptic memory compression compared to full precision (32-bit)
SNN and energy efficiency of 89.49 TOPS/Watt for two-layer fully-connected SNN.
"
1837,"Synchronous Counter Design Using Novel Level Sensitive T-FF in QCA
  Technology","  The quantum-dot cellular automata (QCA) nano-technique has attracted computer
scientists due to its noticeable features such as low power consumption and
small size. Many papers have been published in the literature about the
utilization of this technology for de-signing many QCA circuits and for
presenting logic gates in an optimal structure. The T flip-flop, which is an
essential part of digital designs, can be used to design synchronous and
asynchronous counters. This paper presents a novel T flip-flop structure in an
optimal form. The presented novel gate was used to design an N-bit binary
synchronous counter. The QCADesigner software was used to verify the designed
circuits and to present the simulation results, while the QCAPro tool was used
for the power analysis. The proposed design required minimal power and showed
good improvements over previous designs.
"
1838,"Is my Neural Network Neuromorphic? Taxonomy, Recent Trends and Future
  Directions in Neuromorphic Engineering","  In this paper, we review recent work published over the last 3 years under
the umbrella of Neuromorphic engineering to analyze what are the common
features among such systems. We see that there is no clear consensus but each
system has one or more of the following features:(1) Analog computing (2) Non
vonNeumann Architecture and low-precision digital processing (3) Spiking Neural
Networks (SNN) with components closely related to biology. We compare recent
machine learning accelerator chips to show that indeed analog processing and
reduced bit precision architectures have best throughput, energy and area
efficiencies. However, pure digital architectures can also achieve quite high
efficiencies by just adopting a non von-Neumann architecture. Given the design
automation tools for digital hardware design, it raises a question on the
likelihood of adoption of analog processing in the near future for industrial
designs. Next, we argue about the importance of defining standards and choosing
proper benchmarks for the progress of neuromorphic system designs and propose
some desired characteristics of such benchmarks. Finally, we show brain-machine
interfaces as a potential task that fulfils all the criteria of such
benchmarks.
"
1839,"Single photonic perceptron based on a soliton crystal Kerr microcomb for
  high-speed, scalable, optical neural networks","  Optical artificial neural networks (ONNs), analog computing hardware tailored
for machine learning, have significant potential for ultra-high computing speed
and energy efficiency. We propose a new approach to architectures for ONNs
based on integrated Kerr micro-comb sources that is programmable, highly
scalable and capable of reaching ultra-high speeds. We experimentally
demonstrate the building block of the ONN, a single neuron perceptron, by
mapping synapses onto 49 wavelengths of a micro-comb to achieve a high
single-unit throughput of 11.9 Giga-FLOPS at 8 bits per FLOP, corresponding to
95.2 Gbps. We test the perceptron on simple standard benchmark datasets,
handwritten-digit recognition and cancer-cell detection, achieving over 90% and
85% accuracy, respectively. This performance is a direct result of the record
small wavelength spacing (49GHz) for a coherent integrated microcomb source,
which results in an unprecedented number of wavelengths for neuromorphic
optics. Finally, we propose an approach to scaling the perceptron to a deep
learning network using the same single micro-comb device and standard
off-the-shelf telecommunications technology, for high-throughput operation
involving full matrix multiplication for applications such as real-time massive
data processing for unmanned vehicle and aircraft tracking.
"
1840,"A New MRAM-based Process In-Memory Accelerator for Efficient Neural
  Network Training with Floating Point Precision","  The excellent performance of modern deep neural networks (DNNs) comes at an
often prohibitive training cost, limiting the rapid development of DNN
innovations and raising various environmental concerns. To reduce the dominant
data movement cost of training, process in-memory (PIM) has emerged as a
promising solution as it alleviates the need to access DNN weights. However,
state-of-the-art PIM DNN training accelerators employ either analog/mixed
signal computing which has limited precision or digital computing based on a
memory technology that supports limited logic functions and thus requires
complicated procedure to realize floating point computation. In this paper, we
propose a spin orbit torque magnetic random access memory (SOT-MRAM) based
digital PIM accelerator that supports floating point precision. Specifically,
this new accelerator features an innovative (1) SOT-MRAM cell, (2) full
addition design, and (3) floating point computation. Experiment results show
that the proposed SOT-MRAM PIM based DNN training accelerator can achieve
3.3$\times$, 1.8$\times$, and 2.5$\times$ improvement in terms of energy,
latency, and area, respectively, compared with a state-of-the-art PIM based DNN
training accelerator.
"
1841,"Laser Induced Speckle as a Foundation for Physical Security and Optical
  Computing","  We present a photonic system that exploits the speckle generated by the
interaction of a laser source and a semitransparent scattering medium, in our
case a large-core optical fiber, as a physical root of trust for cryptographic
applications, while the same configuration can act as a high-rate machine
learning paradigm.
"
1842,Hardware Design for Autonomous Bayesian Networks,"  Directed acyclic graphs or Bayesian networks that are popular in many AI
related sectors for probabilistic inference and causal reasoning can be mapped
to probabilistic circuits built out of probabilistic bits (p-bits), analogous
to binary stochastic neurons of stochastic artificial neural networks. In order
to satisfy standard statistical results, individual p-bits not only need to be
updated sequentially, but also in order from the parent to the child nodes,
necessitating the use of sequencers in software implementations. In this
article, we first use SPICE simulations to show that an autonomous hardware
Bayesian network can operate correctly without any clocks or sequencers, but
only if the individual p-bits are appropriately designed. We then present a
simple behavioral model of the autonomous hardware illustrating the essential
characteristics needed for correct sequencer-free operation. This model is also
benchmarked against SPICE simulations and can be used to simulate large scale
networks. Our results could be useful in the design of hardware accelerators
that use energy efficient building blocks suited for low-level implementations
of Bayesian networks. The autonomous massively parallel operation of our
proposed stochastic hardware has biological relevance since neural dynamics in
brain is also stochastic and autonomous by nature.
"
1843,Deep Learning in Memristive Nanowire Networks,"  Analog crossbar architectures for accelerating neural network training and
inference have made tremendous progress over the past several years. These
architectures are ideal for dense layers with fewer than roughly a thousand
neurons. However, for large sparse layers, crossbar architectures are highly
inefficient. A new hardware architecture, dubbed the MN3 (Memristive Nanowire
Neural Network), was recently described as an efficient architecture for
simulating very wide, sparse neural network layers, on the order of millions of
neurons per layer. The MN3 utilizes a high-density memristive nanowire mesh to
efficiently connect large numbers of silicon neurons with modifiable weights.
Here, in order to explore the MN3's ability to function as a deep neural
network, we describe one algorithm for training deep MN3 models and benchmark
simulations of the architecture on two deep learning tasks. We utilize a simple
piecewise linear memristor model, since we seek to demonstrate that training
is, in principle, possible for randomized nanowire architectures. In future
work, we intend on utilizing more realistic memristor models, and we will adapt
the presented algorithm appropriately. We show that the MN3 is capable of
performing composition, gradient propagation, and weight updates, which
together allow it to function as a deep neural network. We show that a
simulated multilayer perceptron (MLP), built from MN3 networks, can obtain a
1.61% error rate on the popular MNIST dataset, comparable to equivalently sized
software-based network. This work represents, to the authors' knowledge, the
first randomized nanowire architecture capable of reproducing the
backpropagation algorithm.
"
1844,"Enhancing a Near-Term Quantum Accelerator's Instruction Set Architecture
  for Materials Science Applications","  Quantum computers with tens to hundreds of noisy qubits are being developed
today. To be useful for real-world applications, we believe that these
near-term systems cannot simply be scaled-down non-error-corrected versions of
future fault-tolerant large-scale quantum computers. These near-term systems
require specific architecture and design attributes to realize their full
potential. To efficiently execute an algorithm, the quantum coprocessor must be
designed to scale with respect to qubit number and to maximize useful
computation within the qubits' decoherence bounds. In this work, we employ an
application-system-qubit co-design methodology to architect a near-term quantum
coprocessor. To support algorithms from the real-world application area of
simulating the quantum dynamics of a material system, we design a
(parameterized) arbitrary single-qubit rotation instruction and a two-qubit
entangling controlled-Z instruction. We introduce dynamic gate set and paging
mechanisms to implement the instructions. To evaluate the functionality and
performance of these two instructions, we implement a two-qubit version of an
algorithm to study a disorder-induced metal-insulator transition and run 60
random instances of it, each of which realizes one disorder configuration and
contains 40 two-qubit instructions (or gates) and 104 single-qubit
instructions. We observe the expected quantum dynamics of the time-evolution of
this system.
"
1845,Compiling Neural Networks for a Computational Memory Accelerator,"  Computational memory (CM) is a promising approach for accelerating inference
on neural networks (NN) by using enhanced memories that, in addition to storing
data, allow computations on them. One of the main challenges of this approach
is defining a hardware/software interface that allows a compiler to map NN
models for efficient execution on the underlying CM accelerator. This is a
non-trivial task because efficiency dictates that the CM accelerator is
explicitly programmed as a dataflow engine where the execution of the different
NN layers form a pipeline. In this paper, we present our work towards a
software stack for executing ML models on such a multi-core CM accelerator. We
describe an architecture for the hardware and software, and focus on the
problem of implementing the appropriate control logic so that data dependencies
are respected. We propose a solution to the latter that is based on polyhedral
compilation.
"
1846,Physics for Neuromorphic Computing,"  Neuromorphic computing takes inspiration from the brain to create energy
efficient hardware for information processing, capable of highly sophisticated
tasks. In this article, we make the case that building this new hardware
necessitates reinventing electronics. We show that research in physics and
material science will be key to create artificial nano-neurons and synapses, to
connect them together in huge numbers, to organize them in complex systems, and
to compute with them efficiently. We describe how some researchers choose to
take inspiration from artificial intelligence to move forward in this
direction, whereas others prefer taking inspiration from neuroscience, and we
highlight recent striking results obtained with these two approaches. Finally,
we discuss the challenges and perspectives in neuromorphic physics, which
include developing the algorithms and the hardware hand in hand, making
significant advances with small toy systems, as well as building large scale
networks.
"
1847,SIMBA: A Skyrmionic In-Memory Binary Neural Network Accelerator,"  Magnetic skyrmions are emerging as potential candidates for next generation
non-volatile memories. In this paper, we propose an in-memory binary neural
network (BNN) accelerator based on the non-volatile skyrmionic memory, which we
call as SIMBA. SIMBA consumes 26.7 mJ of energy and 2.7 ms of latency when
running an inference on a VGG-like BNN. Furthermore, we demonstrate
improvements in the performance of SIMBA by optimizing material parameters such
as saturation magnetization, anisotropic energy and damping ratio. Finally, we
show that the inference accuracy of BNNs is robust against the possible
stochastic behavior of SIMBA (88.5% +/- 1%).
"
1848,"DNN+NeuroSim V2.0: An End-to-End Benchmarking Framework for
  Compute-in-Memory Accelerators for On-chip Training","  DNN+NeuroSim is an integrated framework to benchmark compute-in-memory (CIM)
accelerators for deep neural networks, with hierarchical design options from
device-level, to circuit-level and up to algorithm-level. A python wrapper is
developed to interface NeuroSim with a popular machine learning platform:
Pytorch, to support flexible network structures. The framework provides
automatic algorithm-to-hardware mapping, and evaluates chip-level area, energy
efficiency and throughput for training or inference, as well as
training/inference accuracy with hardware constraints. Our prior work
(DNN+NeuroSim V1.1) was developed to estimate the impact of reliability in
synaptic devices, and analog-to-digital converter (ADC) quantization loss on
the accuracy and hardware performance of inference engines. In this work, we
further investigated the impact of the analog emerging non-volatile memory
non-ideal device properties for on-chip training. By introducing the
nonlinearity, asymmetry, device-to-device and cycle-to-cycle variation of
weight update into the python wrapper, and peripheral circuits for error/weight
gradient computation in NeuroSim core, we benchmarked CIM accelerators based on
state-of-the-art SRAM and eNVM devices for VGG-8 on CIFAR-10 dataset, revealing
the crucial specs of synaptic devices for on-chip training. The proposed
DNN+NeuroSim V2.0 framework is available on GitHub.
"
1849,"GENIEx: A Generalized Approach to Emulating Non-Ideality in Memristive
  Xbars using Neural Networks","  The analog nature of computing in Memristive crossbars poses significant
issues due to various non-idealities such as: parasitic resistances, non-linear
I-V characteristics of the device etc. The non-idealities can have a
detrimental impact on the functionality i.e. computational accuracy of
crossbars. Past works have explored modeling the non-idealities using
analytical techniques. However, several non-idealities have data dependent
behavior. This can not be captured using analytical (non data-dependent) models
thereby, limiting their suitability in predicting application accuracy.
  To address this, we propose a Generalized Approach to Emulating Non-Ideality
in Memristive Crossbars using Neural Networks (GENIEx), which accurately
captures the data-dependent nature of non-idealities. We perform extensive
HSPICE simulations of crossbars with different voltage and conductance
combinations. Following that, we train a neural network to learn the transfer
characteristics of the non-ideal crossbar. Next, we build a functional
simulator which includes key architectural facets such as \textit{tiling}, and
\textit{bit-slicing} to analyze the impact of non-idealities on the
classification accuracy of large-scale neural networks. We show that GENIEx
achieves \textit{low} root mean square errors (RMSE) of $0.25$ and $0.7$ for
low and high voltages, respectively, compared to HSPICE. Additionally, the
GENIEx errors are $7\times$ and $12.8\times$ better than an analytical model
which can only capture the linear non-idealities. Further, using the functional
simulator and GENIEx, we demonstrate that an analytical model can overestimate
the degradation in classification accuracy by $\ge 10\%$ on CIFAR-100 and
$3.7\%$ on ImageNet datasets compared to GENIEx.
"
1850,Memristive Learning Cellular Automata: Theory and Applications,"  Memristors are novel non volatile devices that manage to combine storing and
processing capabilities in the same physical place.Their nanoscale dimensions
and low power consumption enable the further design of various nanoelectronic
processing circuits and corresponding computing architectures, like
neuromorhpic, in memory, unconventional, etc.One of the possible ways to
exploit the memristor's advantages is by combining them with Cellular Automata
(CA).CA constitute a well known non von Neumann computing architecture that is
based on the local interconnection of simple identical cells forming
N-dimensional grids.These local interconnections allow the emergence of global
and complex phenomena.In this paper, we propose a hybridization of the CA
original definition coupled with memristor based implementation, and, more
specifically, we focus on Memristive Learning Cellular Automata (MLCA), which
have the ability of learning using also simple identical interconnected cells
and taking advantage of the memristor devices inherent variability.The proposed
MLCA circuit level implementation is applied on optimal detection of edges in
image processing through a series of SPICE simulations, proving its robustness
and efficacy.
"
1851,"Traffic Signal Optimization on a Square Lattice using the D-Wave Quantum
  Annealer","  The spread of intelligent transportation systems in urban cities has caused
heavy computational loads, requiring a novel architecture for managing
large-scale traffic. In this study, we develop a method for globally
controlling traffic signals arranged on a square lattice by means of a quantum
annealing machine, namely the D-Wave quantum annealer. We first formulate a
signal optimization problem that minimizes the imbalance of traffic flows in
two orthogonal directions. Then we reformulate this problem as an Ising
Hamiltonian, which is fully compatible with quantum annealers. The new control
method is compared with a conventional local control method for a large
50-by-50 city, and the results exhibit the superiority of our global control
method in suppressing traffic imbalance over wide parameter ranges.
Furthermore, the solutions to the global control method obtained with the
quantum annealing machine are better than those obtained with conventional
simulated annealing. In addition, we prove analytically that the local and the
global control methods converge at the limit where cars have equal
probabilities for turning and going straight. These results are verified with
numerical experiments.

1852,Capacitive storage in mycelium substrate,"  The emerging field of living technologies aims to create new functional
hybrid materials in which living systems interface with artificial ones.
Combining research into living technologies with emerging developments in
computing architecture has enabled the generation of organic electronics from
plants and slime mould. Here, we expand on this work by studying capacitive
properties of a substrate colonised by mycelium of grey oyster fungi, Pleurotus
ostreatus. Capacitors play a fundamental role in traditional analogue and
digital electronic systems and have a range of uses including sensing, energy
storage and filter circuits. Mycelium has the potential to be used as an
organic replacement for traditional capacitor technology. Here, were show that
the capacitance of mycelium is in the order of hundreds of pico-Farads. We also
demonstrate that the charge density of the mycelium `dielectric' decays rapidly
with increasing distance from the source probes. This is important as it
indicates that small cells of mycelium could be used as a charge carrier or
storage medium, when employed as part of an array with reasonable density.
"
1853,Fungal photosensors,"  The rapidly developing research field of organic analogue sensors aims to
replace traditional semiconductors with naturally occurring materials.
Photosensors, or photodetectors, change their electrical properties in response
to the light levels they are exposed to. Organic photosensors can be
functionalised to respond to specific wavelengths, from ultra-violet to red
light. Performing cyclic voltammetry on fungal mycelium and fruiting bodies
under different lighting conditions shows no appreciable response to changes in
lighting condition. However, functionalising the specimen using PEDOT:PSS
yields in a photosensor that produces large, instantaneous current spikes when
the light conditions change. Future works would look at interfacing this
organic photosensor with an appropriate digital back-end for interpreting and
processing the response.
"
1854,Fungal Automata,"  We study a cellular automaton (CA) model of information dynamics on a single
hypha of a fungal mycelium. Such a filament is divided in compartments (here
also called cells) by septa. These septa are invaginations of the cell wall and
their pores allow for flow of cytoplasm between compartments and hyphae. The
septal pores of the fungal phylum of the Ascomycota can be closed by organelles
called Woronin bodies. Septal closure is increased when the septa become older
and when exposed to stress conditions. Thus, Woronin bodies act as
informational flow valves. The one dimensional fungal automata is a binary
state ternary neighbourhood CA, where every compartment follows one of the
elementary cellular automata (ECA) rules if its pores are open and either
remains in state `0' (first species of fungal automata) or its previous state
(second species of fungal automata) if its pores are closed. The Woronin bodies
closing the pores are also governed by ECA rules. We analyse a structure of the
composition space of cell-state transition and pore-state transitions rules,
complexity of fungal automata with just few Woronin bodies, and exemplify
several important local events in the automaton dynamics.
"
1855,"Automatic accuracy management of quantum programs via (near-)symbolic
  resource estimation","  When compiling programs for fault-tolerant quantum computers, approximation
errors must be taken into account. We propose a methodology that tracks such
errors automatically and solves the optimization problem of finding accuracy
parameters that guarantee a specified overall accuracy while aiming to minimize
a custom implementation cost. The core idea is to extract constraint and cost
functions directly from the high-level description of the quantum program.
Then, our custom compiler passes optimize these functions, turning them into
(near-)symbolic expressions for (1) the total error and (2) the implementation
cost (e.g., total gate count). All unspecified parameters of the quantum
program will show up as variables in these expressions, including accuracy
parameters. After solving the corresponding optimization problem, a circuit can
be instantiated from the found solution. We develop two prototype
implementations, one in C++ based on Clang/LLVM, and another using the Q#
compiler infrastructure. We benchmark our prototypes on typical quantum
computing programs, including the quantum Fourier transform, quantum phase
estimation, and Shor's algorithm.
"
1856,Computational universality of fungal sandpile automata,"  Hyphae within the mycelia of the ascomycetous fungi are compartmentalised by
septa. Each septum has a pore that allows for inter-compartmental and
inter-hyphal streaming of cytosol and even organelles. The compartments,
however, have special organelles, Woronin bodies, that can plug the pores. When
the pores are blocked, no flow of cytoplasm takes place. Inspired by the
controllable compartmentalisation within the mycelium of the ascomycetous fungi
we designed two-dimensional fungal automata. A fungal automaton is a cellular
automaton where communication between neighbouring cells can be blocked on
demand. We demonstrate computational universality of the fungal automata by
implementing sandpile cellular automata circuits there. We reduce the Monotone
Circuit Value Problem to the Fungal Automaton Prediction Problem. We construct
families of wires, cross-overs and gates to prove that the fungal automata are
P-complete.
"
1857,Storing and retrieving wavefronts with resistive temporal memory,"  We extend the reach of temporal computing schemes by developing a memory for
multi-channel temporal patterns or ""wavefronts."" This temporal memory
re-purposes conventional one-transistor-one-resistor (1T1R) memristor crossbars
for use in an arrival-time coded, single-event-per-wire temporal computing
environment. The memristor resistances and the associated circuit capacitances
provide the necessary time constants, enabling the memory array to store and
retrieve wavefronts. The retrieval operation of such a memory is naturally in
the temporal domain and the resulting wavefronts can be used to trigger
time-domain computations. While recording the wavefronts can be done using
standard digital techniques, that approach has substantial translation costs
between temporal and digital domains. To avoid these costs, we propose a spike
timing dependent plasticity (STDP) inspired wavefront recording scheme to
capture incoming wavefronts. We simulate these designs with experimentally
validated memristor models and analyze the effects of memristor non-idealities
on the operation of such a memory.
"
1858,Hadamard-free circuits expose the structure of the Clifford group,"  The Clifford group plays a central role in quantum randomized benchmarking,
quantum tomography, and error correction protocols. Here we study the
structural properties of this group. We show that any Clifford operator can be
uniquely written in the canonical form $F_1HSF_2$, where $H$ is a layer of
Hadamard gates, $S$ is a permutation of qubits, and $F_i$ are parameterized
Hadamard-free circuits chosen from suitable subgroups of the Clifford group.
Our canonical form provides a one-to-one correspondence between Clifford
operators and layered quantum circuits. We report a polynomial-time algorithm
for computing the canonical form. We employ this canonical form to generate a
random uniformly distributed $n$-qubit Clifford operator in runtime $O(n^2)$.
The number of random bits consumed by the algorithm matches the
information-theoretic lower bound. A surprising connection is highlighted
between random uniform Clifford operators and the Mallows distribution on the
symmetric group. The variants of the canonical form, one with a short
Hadamard-free part and one allowing a circuit depth $9n$ implementation of
arbitrary Clifford unitaries in the Linear Nearest Neighbor architecture are
also discussed. Finally, we study computational quantum advantage where a
classical reversible linear circuit can be implemented more efficiently using
Clifford gates, and show an explicit example where such an advantage takes
place.
"
1859,Polaritonic XY-Ising Machine,"  Gain-dissipative systems of various physical origin have recently shown the
ability to act as analogue minimisers of hard combinatorial optimisation
problems. Whether or not these proposals will lead to any advantage in
performance over the classical computations depends on the ability to establish
controllable couplings for sufficiently dense short- and long-range
interactions between the spins. Here, we propose a polaritonic XY-Ising machine
based on a network of geometrically isolated polariton condensates capable of
minimising discrete and continuous spin Hamiltonians. We elucidate the
performance of the proposed computing platform for two types of couplings:
relative and absolute. The interactions between the network nodes might be
controlled by redirecting the emission between the condensates or by sending
the phase information between nodes using resonant excitation. We discuss the
conditions under which the proposed machine leads to a pure polariton simulator
with pre-programmed couplings or results in a hybrid classical polariton
simulator. We argue that the proposed architecture for the remote coupling
control offers an improvement over geometrically coupled condensates in both
accuracy and stability as well as increases versatility, range and connectivity
of spin Hamiltonians that can be simulated with polariton networks.
"
1860,"Mobility-aware Beam Steering in Metasurface-based Programmable Wireless
  Environments","  Programmable wireless environments (PWEs) utilize electromagnetic
metasurfaces to transform wireless propagation into a software-controlled
resource. In this work we study the effects of user device mobility on the
efficiency of PWEs. An analytical model is proposed, which describes the
potential misalignment between user-emitted waves and the active PWE
configuration, and can constitute the basis for studying queuing problems in
PWEs. Subsequently, a novel, beam steering approach is proposed which can
effectively mitigate the misalignment effects. Ray-tracing-based simulations
evaluate the proposed scheme.
"
1861,"Microfabricated Neuroaccelerometer: Integrating Sensing and Reservoir
  Computing in MEMS","  This study presents the design, fabrication, and test of a micro
accelerometer with intrinsic processing capabilities, that integrates the
functions of sensing and computing in the same MEMS. The device consists of an
inertial mass electrostatically coupled to an oscillating beam through a gap of
8 {\mu}m. The motion of the inertial mass modulates an AC electrostatic field
that drives the beam in its non-linear regime. This non-linearity is used to
implement machine learning in the mechanical domain, using reservoir computing
with delayed feedback to process the acceleration information provided by the
inertial mass. The device is microfabricated on a silicon-on-insulator
substrate using conventional MEMS processes. Dynamic characterization showed
good accelerometer functionalities, with an inertial mass sensitivity on the
order of 100 mV/g from 250 to 1300 Hz and a natural frequency of 1.7 kHz. In
order to test the device computing capabilities, two different machine learning
benchmarks were implemented, with the inputs fed to the device as
accelerations. The neuromorphic MEMS accelerometer was able to accurately
emulate non-linear autoregressive moving average models and compute the parity
of random bit streams. These results were obtained in a test system with a
non-trivial transfer function, showing a robustness that is well-suited to
anticipated applications.
"
1862,Memcomputing for Accelerated Optimization,"  In this work, we introduce the concept of an entirely new circuit
architecture based on the novel, physics-inspired computing paradigm:
Memcomputing. In particular, we focus on digital memcomputing machines (DMMs)
that can be designed leveraging properties of non-linear dynamical systems;
ultimate descriptors of electronic circuits. The working principle of these
systems relies on the ability of currents and voltages of the circuit to
self-organize in order to satisfy mathematical relations. In particular for
this work, we discuss self-organizing gates, namely Self-Organizing Algebraic
Gates (SOAGs), aimed to solve linear inequalities and therefore used to solve
optimization problems in Integer Linear Programming (ILP) format. Unlike
conventional I\O gates, SOAGs are terminal-agnostic, meaning each terminal
handles a superposition of input and output signals. When appropriately
assembled to represent a given ILP problem, the corresponding self-organizing
circuit converges to the equilibria that express the solutions to the problem
at hand. Because DMM's components are non-quantum, the ordinary differential
equations describing it can be efficiently simulated on our modern computers in
software, as well as be built in hardware with off-of-the-shelf technology. As
an example, we show the performance of this novel approach implemented as
Software as a Service (MemCPU XPC) to address an ILP problem. Compared to
today's best solution found using a world renowned commercial solver, MemCPU
XPC brings the time to solution down from 23 hours to less than 2 minutes.
"
1863,Reservoir Computing with Planar Nanomagnet Arrays,"  Reservoir computing is an emerging methodology for neuromorphic computing
that is especially well-suited for hardware implementations in size, weight,
and power (SWaP) constrained environments. This work proposes a novel hardware
implementation of a reservoir computer using a planar nanomagnet array. A small
nanomagnet reservoir is demonstrated via micromagnetic simulations to be able
to identify simple waveforms with 100% accuracy. Planar nanomagnet reservoirs
are a promising new solution to the growing need for dedicated neuromorphic
hardware.
"
1864,"Probabilistic Memristive Networks: Application of a Master Equation to
  Networks of Binary ReRAM cells","  The possibility of using non-deterministic circuit components has been
gaining significant attention in recent years. The modeling and simulation of
their circuits require novel approaches, as now the state of a circuit at an
arbitrary moment in time cannot be precisely predicted. Generally, these
circuits should be described in terms of probabilities, the circuit variables
should be calculated on average, and correlation functions should be used to
explore interrelations among the variables. In this paper, we use, for the
first time, a master equation to analyze the networks composed of probabilistic
binary memristors. Analytical solutions of the master equation for the case of
identical memristors connected in-series and in-parallel are found. Our
analytical results are supplemented by results of numerical simulations that
extend our findings beyond the case of identical memristors. The approach
proposed in this paper facilitates the development of probabilistic/stochastic
electronic circuits and advance their real-world applications.
"
1865,"Unsupervised Competitive Hardware Learning Rule for Spintronic
  Clustering Architecture","  We propose a hardware learning rule for unsupervised clustering within a
novel spintronic computing architecture. The proposed approach leverages the
three-terminal structure of domain-wall magnetic tunnel junction devices to
establish a feedback loop that serves to train such devices when they are used
as synapses in a neuromorphic computing architecture.
"
1866,Nanophotonic spin-glass for realization of a coherent Ising machine,"  The need for solving optimization problems is prevalent in a wide range of
physical applications, including neuroscience, network design, biological
systems, socio-economics, and chemical reactions. Many of these are classified
as non-deterministic polynomial-time (NP) hard and thus become intractable to
solve as the system scales to a large number of elements. Recent research
advances in photonics have sparked interest in using a network of coupled
degenerate optical parametric oscillators (DOPO's) to effectively find the
ground state of the Ising Hamiltonian, which can be used to solve other
combinatorial optimization problems through polynomial-time mapping. Here,
using the nanophotonic silicon-nitride platform, we propose a network of
on-chip spatial-multiplexed DOPO's for the realization of a photonic coherent
Ising machine. We demonstrate the generation and coupling of two
microresonator-based DOPO's on a single chip. Through a reconfigurable phase
link, we achieve both in-phase and out-of-phase operation, which can be
deterministically achieved at a fast regeneration speed of 400 kHz with a large
phase tolerance. Our work provides the critical building blocks towards the
realization of a chip-scale photonic Ising machine.
"
1867,"Information and Communication Theoretical Understanding and Treatment of
  Spinal Cord Injuries: State-of-the-art and Research Challenges","  Among the various key networks in the human body, the nervous system occupies
central importance. The debilitating effects of spinal cord injuries (SCI)
impact a significant number of people throughout the world, and to date, there
is no satisfactory method to treat them. In this paper, we review the major
treatment techniques for SCI that include promising solutions based on
information and communication technology (ICT) and identify the key
characteristics of such systems. We then introduce two novel ICT-based
treatment approaches for SCI. The first proposal is based on neural interface
systems (NIS) with enhanced feedback, where the external machines are
interfaced with the brain and the spinal cord such that the brain signals are
directly routed to the limbs for movement. The second proposal relates to the
design of self-organizing artificial neurons (ANs) that can be used to replace
the injured or dead biological neurons. Apart from SCI treatment, the proposed
methods may also be utilized as enabling technologies for neural interface
applications by acting as bio-cyber interfaces between the nervous system and
machines. Furthermore, under the framework of Internet of Bio- Nano Things
(IoBNT), experience gained from SCI treatment techniques can be transferred to
nano communication research to develop intra-body applications, including
remote monitoring of the body and automatized targeted drug delivery.
"
1868,"Redesigning Photonic Interconnects with Silicon-on-Sapphire Device
  Platform for Ultra-Low-Energy On-Chip Communication","  Traditional silicon-on-insulator (SOI) platform based on-chip photonic
interconnects have limited energy-bandwidth scalability due to the optical
non-linearity induced power constraints of the constituent photonic devices. In
this paper, we propose to break this scalability barrier using a new
silicon-on-sapphire (SOS) based photonic device platform. Our physical-layer
characterization results show that SOS-based photonic devices have negligible
optical non-linearity effects in the mid-infrared region near 4{\mu}m, which
drastically alleviates their power constraints. Our link-level analysis shows
that SOS-based photonic devices can be used to realize photonic links with
aggregated data rate of more than 1 Tb/s, which recently has been deemed
unattainable for the SOI-based photonic on-chip links. We also show that such
high-throughput SOS-based photonic links can significantly improve the
energy-efficiency of on-chip photonic communication architectures. Our
system-level analysis results position SOS-based photonic interconnects to pave
the way for realizing ultra-low-energy (< 1 pJ/bit) on-chip data transfers.
"
1869,"Tactile sensing and computing on a random network of conducting fluid
  channels","  Liquid electronic sensors are typically based on regular arrays of channels
filled with a conductive liquid. We propose that a random planar network of
conducting liquid allows us for a wider spectrum of electrical responses and
localisation of tactile stimuli. We also speculate that a computation protocol
can be implemented on such a network, featuring mechanical inputs and
electrical outputs. Our results pave a way towards future developments on
sensing and computing wearables with disordered sensing networks structure.
"
1870,"IMAC: In-memory multi-bit Multiplication andACcumulation in 6T SRAM
  Array","  `In-memory computing' is being widely explored as a novel computing paradigm
to mitigate the well known memory bottleneck. This emerging paradigm aims at
embedding some aspects of computations inside the memory array, thereby
avoiding frequent and expensive movement of data between the compute unit and
the storage memory. In-memory computing with respect to Silicon memories has
been widely explored on various memory bit-cells. Embedding computation inside
the 6 transistor (6T) SRAM array is of special interest since it is the most
widely used on-chip memory. In this paper, we present a novel in-memory
multiplication followed by accumulation operation capable of performing
parallel dot products within 6T SRAM without any changes to the standard
bitcell. We, further, study the effect of circuit non-idealities and process
variations on the accuracy of the LeNet-5 and VGG neural network architectures
against the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, respectively. The proposed in-memory
dot-product mechanism achieves 88.8% and 99% accuracy for the CIFAR-10 and
MNIST, respectively. Compared to the standard von Neumann system, the proposed
system is 6.24x better in energy consumption and 9.42x better in delay.
"
1871,"Hardness of Reconfiguring Robot Swarms with Uniform External Control in
  Limited Directions","  Motivated by advances is nanoscale applications and simplistic robot agents,
we look at problems based on using a global signal to move all agents when
given a limited number of directional signals and immovable geometry. We study
a model where unit square particles move within a 2D grid based on uniform
external forces. Movement is based on a sequence of uniform commands which
cause all particles to move 1 step in a specific direction. The 2D grid board
additionally contains ""blocked"" spaces which prevent particles from entry.
Within this model, we investigate the complexity of deciding 1) whether a
target location on the board can be occupied (by any) particle (\emph{occupancy
problem}), 2) whether a specific particle can be relocated to another specific
position in the board (\emph{relocation problem}), and 3) whether a board
configuration can be transformed into another configuration
(\emph{reconfiguration problem}). We prove that while occupancy is solvable in
polynomial time, the relocation and reconfiguration problems are both
NP-Complete even when restricted to only 2 or 3 movement directions. We further
define a hierarchy of board geometries and show that this hardness holds for
even very restricted classes of board geometry.
"
1872,"Deep Molecular Programming: A Natural Implementation of Binary-Weight
  ReLU Neural Networks","  Embedding computation in molecular contexts incompatible with traditional
electronics is expected to have wide ranging impact in synthetic biology,
medicine, nanofabrication and other fields. A key remaining challenge lies in
developing programming paradigms for molecular computation that are
well-aligned with the underlying chemical hardware and do not attempt to
shoehorn ill-fitting electronics paradigms. We discover a surprisingly tight
connection between a popular class of neural networks (binary-weight ReLU aka
BinaryConnect) and a class of coupled chemical reactions that are absolutely
robust to reaction rates. The robustness of rate-independent chemical
computation makes it a promising target for bioengineering implementation. We
show how a BinaryConnect neural network trained in silico using well-founded
deep learning optimization techniques, can be compiled to an equivalent
chemical reaction network, providing a novel molecular programming paradigm. We
illustrate such translation on the paradigmatic IRIS and MNIST datasets. Toward
intended applications of chemical computation, we further use our method to
generate a chemical reaction network that can discriminate between different
virus types based on gene expression levels. Our work sets the stage for rich
knowledge transfer between neural network and molecular programming
communities.
"
1873,"Design and Simulation of Memristor-Based Artificial Neural Network for
  Bidirectional Adaptive Neural Interface","  This article proposes a general approach to the simulation and design of a
multilayer perceptron (MLP) network on the basis of cross-bar arrays of
metal-oxide memristive devices. The proposed approach uses the ANNM theory,
tolerance theory, simulation methodology and experiment design. The tolerances
analysis and synthesis process is performed for the ANNM hardware
implementation on the basis of two arrays of memristive microdevices in the
original 16x16 cross-bar topology being a component of bidirectional adaptive
neural interface for automatic registration and stimulation of bioelectrical
activity of a living neuronal culture used in robotics control system. The ANNM
is trained for solving a nonlinear classification problem of stable information
characteristics registered in the culture grown on a multi-electrode array.
Memristive devices are fabricated on the basis of a newly engineered
Au/Ta/ZrO2(Y)/Ta2O5/TiN/Ti multilayer structure, which contains self-organized
interface oxide layers, nanocrystals and is specially developed to obtain
robust resistive switching with low variation of parameters. An array of
memristive devices is mounted into a standard metal-ceramic package and can be
easily integrated into the neurointerface circuit. Memristive devices
demonstrate bipolar switching of anionic type between the high-resistance state
and low-resistance state and can be programmed to set the intermediate
resistive states with a desired accuracy. The ANNM tuning, testing and control
are implemented by the FPGA-based control subsystem. All developed models and
algorithms are implemented as Python-based software.
"
1874,"A Hybrid FeMFET-CMOS Analog Synapse Circuit for Neural Network Training
  and Inference","  An analog synapse circuit based on ferroelectric-metal field-effect
transistors is proposed, that offers 6-bit weight precision. The circuit is
comprised of volatile least significant bits (LSBs) used solely during
training, and non-volatile most significant bits (MSBs) used for both training
and inference. The design works at a 1.8V logic-compatible voltage, provides
10^10 endurance cycles, and requires only 250ps update pulses. A variant of
LeNet trained with the proposed synapse achieves 98.2% accuracy on MNIST, which
is only 0.4% lower than an ideal implementation of the same network with the
same bit precision. Furthermore, the proposed synapse offers improvements of up
to 26% in area, 44.8% in leakage power, 16.7% in LSB update pulse duration, and
two orders of magnitude in endurance cycles, when compared to state-of-the-art
hybrid synaptic circuits. Our proposed synapse can be extended to an 8-bit
design, enabling a VGG-like network to achieve 88.8% accuracy on CIFAR-10 (only
0.8% lower than an ideal implementation of the same network).
"
1875,How to Compute Using Quantum Walks,"  Quantum walks are widely and successfully used to model diverse physical
processes. This leads to computation of the models, to explore their
properties. Quantum walks have also been shown to be universal for quantum
computing. This is a more subtle result than is often appreciated, since it
applies to computations run on qubit-based quantum computers in the single
walker case, and physical quantum walks in the multi-walker case (quantum
cellular automata). Nonetheless, quantum walks are powerful tools for quantum
computing when correctly applied. In this paper, I explain the relationship
between quantum walks as models and quantum walks as computational tools, and
give some examples of their application in both contexts.
"
1876,Theoretical Studies on Quantum Walks with a Time-varying Coin,"  Quantum walks can reconstruct quantum algorithms for quantum computation,
where the precise controls of quantum state transfers between arbitrary distant
sites are required. Here, we investigate quantum walks using a periodically
time-varying coin both numerically and analytically, in order to explore the
controllability of quantum walks while preserving its random nature.
"
1877,"T-count and Qubit Optimized Quantum Circuit Designs of Carry Lookahead
  Adder","  Quantum circuits of arithmetic operations such as addition are needed to
implement quantum algorithms in hardware. Quantum circuits based on Clifford+T
gates are used as they can be made tolerant to noise. The tradeoff of gaining
fault tolerance from using Clifford+T gates and error correcting codes is the
high implementation overhead of the T gate. As a result, the T-count
performance measure has become important in quantum circuit design. Due to
noise, the risk for errors in a quantum circuit computation increases as the
number of gate layers (or depth) in the circuit increases. As a result, low
depth circuits such as quantum carry lookahead adders (QCLA)s have caught the
attention of researchers. This work presents two QCLA designs each optimized
with emphasis on T-count or qubit cost respectively. In-place and out-of-place
versions of each design are shown. The proposed QCLAs are compared against the
existing works in terms of T-count. The proposed QCLAs for out-of-place
addition achieve average T gate savings of $54.34 \%$ and $37.21 \%$,
respectively. The proposed QCLAs for in-place addition achieve average T gate
savings of $72.11 \%$ and $35.87 \%$
"
1878,Neurosciences and 6G: Lessons from and Needs of Communicative Brains,"  This paper presents the first comprehensive tutorial on a promising research
field located at the frontier of two well-established domains: Neurosciences
and wireless communications, motivated by the ongoing efforts to define how the
sixth generation of mobile networks (6G) will be. In particular, this tutorial
first provides a novel integrative approach that bridges the gap between these
two, seemingly disparate fields. Then, we present the state-of-the-art and key
challenges of these two topics. In particular, we propose a novel
systematization that divides the contributions into two groups, one focused on
what neurosciences will offer to 6G in terms of new applications and systems
architecture (Neurosciences for Wireless), and the other focused on how
wireless communication theory and 6G systems can provide new ways to study the
brain (Wireless for Neurosciences). For the first group, we concretely explain
how current scientific understanding of the brain would enable new application
for 6G within the context of a new type of service that we dub braintype
communications and that has more stringent requirements than human- and
machine-type communication. In this regard, we expose the key requirements of
brain-type communication services and we discuss how future wireless networks
can be equipped to deal with such services. Meanwhile, for the second group, we
thoroughly explore modern communication system paradigms, including Internet of
Bio-nano Things and chaosbased communications, in addition to highlighting how
complex systems tools can help bridging 6G and neuroscience applications.
Brain-controlled vehicles are then presented as our case study. All in all,
this tutorial is expected to provide a largely missing articulation between
these two emerging fields while delineating concrete ways to move forward in
such an interdisciplinary endeavor.
"
1879,"FeCAM: A Universal Compact Digital and Analog Content Addressable Memory
  Using Ferroelectric","  Ferroelectric field effect transistors (FeFETs) are being actively
investigated with the potential for in-memory computing (IMC) over other
non-volatile memories (NVMs). Content Addressable Memories (CAMs) are a form of
IMC that performs parallel searches for matched entries over a memory array for
a given input query. CAMs are widely used for data-centric applications that
involve pattern matching and search functionality. To accommodate the ever
expanding data, it is attractive to resort to analog CAM for memory density
improvement. However, the digital CAM design nowadays based on standard CMOS or
emerging nonvolatile memories (e.g., resistive storage devices) is already
challenging due to area, power, and cost penalties. Thus, it can be extremely
expensive to achieve analog CAM with those technologies due to added cell
components. As such, we propose, for the first time, a universal compact FeFET
based CAM design, FeCAM, with search and storage functionality enabled in
digital and analog domain simultaneously. By exploiting the multi-level-cell
(MLC) states of FeFET, FeCAM can store and search inputs in either digital or
analog domain. We perform a device-circuit co-design of the proposed FeCAM and
validate its functionality and performance using an experimentally calibrated
FeFET model. Circuit level simulation results demonstrate that FeCAM can either
store continuous matching ranges or encode 3-bit data in a single CAM cell.
When compared with the existing digital CMOS based CAM approaches, FeCAM is
found to improve both memory density by 22.4X and energy saving by 8.6/3.2X for
analog/digital modes, respectively. In the CAM-related application, our
evaluations show that FeCAM can achieve 60.5X/23.1X saving in area/search
energy compared with conventional CMOS based CAMs.
"
1880,"Exploration of Input Patterns for Enhancing the Performance of Liquid
  State Machines","  Spiking Neural Networks (SNN) have gained increasing attention for its low
power consumption. But training SNN is challenging. Liquid State Machine (LSM),
as a major type of Reservoir computing, has been widely recognized for its low
training cost among SNNs. The exploration of LSM topology for enhancing
performance often requires hyper-parameter search, which is both
resource-expensive and time-consuming. We explore the influence of input scale
reduction on LSM instead. There are two main reasons for studying input
reduction of LSM. One is that the input dimension of large images requires
efficient processing. Another one is that input exploration is generally more
economic than architecture search. To mitigate the difficulty in effectively
dealing with huge input spaces of LSM, and to find that whether input reduction
can enhance LSM performance, we explore several input patterns, namely
fullscale, scanline, chessboard, and patch. Several datasets have been used to
evaluate the performance of the proposed input patterns, including two spatio
image datasets and one spatio-temporal image database. The experimental results
show that the reduced input under chessboard pattern improves the accuracy by
up to 5%, and reduces execution time by up to 50% with up to 75\% less input
storage than the fullscale input pattern for LSM.
"
1881,Accurate Emulation of Memristive Crossbar Arrays for In-Memory Computing,"  In-memory computing is an emerging non-von Neumann computing paradigm where
certain computational tasks are performed in memory by exploiting the physical
attributes of the memory devices. Memristive devices such as phase-change
memory (PCM), where information is stored in terms of their conductance levels,
are especially well suited for in-memory computing. In particular, memristive
devices, when organized in a crossbar configuration can be used to perform
matrix-vector multiply operations by exploiting Kirchhoff's circuit laws. To
explore the feasibility of such in-memory computing cores in applications such
as deep learning as well as for system-level architectural exploration, it is
highly desirable to develop an accurate hardware emulator that captures the key
physical attributes of the memristive devices. Here, we present one such
emulator for PCM and experimentally validate it using measurements from a PCM
prototype chip. Moreover, we present an application of the emulator for neural
network inference where our emulator can capture the conductance evolution of
approximately 400,000 PCM devices remarkably well.
"
1882,"A Fluid Dynamics Approach to Channel Modeling in Macroscale Molecular
  Communication","  In this paper, a novel fluid dynamics-based approach to channel modeling,
which considers liquid droplets as information carriers instead of molecules in
the molecular communication (MC) channel, is proposed for practical macroscale
MC systems. This approach considers a two-phase flow which is generated by the
interaction of droplets in liquid phase with air molecules in gas phase.
Two-phase flow is combined with the signal reconstruction (SR) of the receiver
(RX) to propose a channel model. The SR part of the model quantifies how the
accuracy of the sensed molecular signal in its reception volume depends on the
sensitivity response of the RX and the adhesion/detachment process of droplets.
The proposed channel model is validated by employing experimental data.

1883,"Minor-embedding heuristics for large-scale annealing processors with
  sparse hardware graphs of up to 102,400 nodes","  Minor embedding heuristics have become an indispensable tool for compiling
problems in quadratically unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) into the
hardware graphs of quantum and CMOS annealing processors. While recent
embedding heuristics have been developed for annealers of moderate size (about
2000 nodes) the size of the latest CMOS annealing processor (with 102,400
nodes) poses entirely new demands on the embedding heuristic. This raises the
question, if recent embedding heuristics can maintain meaningful embedding
performance on hardware graphs of increasing size. Here, we develop an improved
version of the probabilistic-swap-shift-annealing (PSSA) embedding heuristic
[which has recently been demonstrated to outperform the standard embedding
heuristic by D-Wave Systems (Cai et al., 2014)] and evaluate its embedding
performance on hardware graphs of increasing size. For random-cubic and
Barabasi-Albert graphs we find the embedding performance of improved PSSA to
consistently exceed the threshold of the best known complete graph embedding by
a factor of 3.2 and 2.8, respectively, up to hardware graphs with 102,400
nodes. On the other hand, for random graphs with constant edge density not even
improved PSSA can overcome the deterministic threshold guaranteed by the
existence of the best known complete graph embedding. Finally, we prove a new
upper bound on the maximal embeddable size of complete graphs into hardware
graphs of CMOS annealers and show that the embedding performance of its
currently best known complete graph embedding has optimal order for hardware
graphs with fixed coordination number.

1884,A Noise Filter for Dynamic Vision Sensors using Self-adjusting Threshold,"  Neuromorphic event-based dynamic vision sensors (DVS) have much faster
sampling rates and a higher dynamic range than frame-based imagers. However,
they are sensitive to background activity (BA) events which are unwanted. we
propose a new criterion with little computation overhead for defining real
events and BA events by utilizing the global space and time information rather
than the local information by Gaussian convolution, which can be also used as a
filter. We denote the filter as GF. We demonstrate GF on three datasets, each
recorded by a different DVS with different output size. The experimental
results show that our filter produces the clearest frames compared with
baseline filters and run fast.
"
1885,"Reservoir Computing using High Order Synchronization of Coupled
  Oscillators","  We propose a concept for reservoir computing on oscillators using the
high-order synchronization effect. The reservoir output is presented in the
form of oscillator synchronization metrics: fractional high-order
synchronization value and synchronization efficiency, expressed as a
percentage. Using two coupled relaxation oscillators built on VO2 switches, we
created an oscillator reservoir that allows simulating the XOR operation. The
reservoir can operate as with static input data (power currents, coupling
forces), as with dynamic data in the form of spike sequences. Having a small
number of oscillators and significant non-linearity, the reservoir expresses a
wide range of dynamic states. The proposed computing concept can be implemented
on oscillators of diverse nature.
"
1886,"Resource-Optimized Fermionic Local-Hamiltonian Simulation on Quantum
  Computer for Quantum Chemistry","  The ability to simulate a fermionic system on a quantum computer is expected
to revolutionize chemical engineering, materials design, nuclear physics, to
name a few. Thus, optimizing the simulation circuits is of significance in
harnessing the power of quantum computers. Here, we address this problem in two
aspects. In the fault-tolerant regime, we optimize the $\rzgate$ gate counts
and depths, assuming the use of a product-formula algorithm for implementation.
In the pre-fault tolerant regime, we optimize the two-qubit gate counts,
assuming the use of variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) approach.
Specifically to the latter, we present a framework that enables bootstrapping
the VQE progression towards the convergence of the ground-state energy of the
fermionic system. This framework, based on perturbation theory, also improves
the energy estimate at each cycle of the VQE progression dramatically,
resulting in significant savings of quantum resources required to be within a
pre-specified tolerance from the known ground-state energy in the test-bed,
classically-accessible system of the water molecule. We also explore a suite of
generalized transformations of fermion to qubit operators and show that
resource-requirement savings of up to nearly $20\%$ is possible.
"
1887,"Exploring Extended Reality with ILLIXR: A New Playground for
  Architecture Research","  As the need for specialization increases and architectures become
increasingly domain-specific, it is important for architects to understand the
requirements of emerging application domains. Augmented and virtual reality
(AR/VR) or extended reality (XR) is one such important domain. This paper
presents a generic XR workflow and the first benchmark suite, ILLIXR (Illinois
Extended Reality Benchmark Suite), that represents key computations from this
workflow. Our analysis shows a large number of interesting implications for
architects, including demanding performance, thermal, and energy requirements
and a large diversity of critical tasks such that an accelerator per task is
likely to overshoot area constraints. ILLIXR and our analysis have the
potential to propel new directions in architecture research in general, and
impact XR in particular. ILLIXR is open-source and available at

"
1888,QuASeR -- Quantum Accelerated De Novo DNA Sequence Reconstruction,"  In this article, we present QuASeR, a reference-free DNA sequence
reconstruction implementation via de novo assembly on both gate-based and
quantum annealing platforms. Each one of the four steps of the implementation
(TSP, QUBO, Hamiltonians and QAOA) is explained with simple proof-of-concept
examples to target both the genomics research community and quantum application
developers in a self-contained manner. The details of the implementation are
discussed for the various layers of the quantum full-stack accelerator design.
We also highlight the limitations of current classical simulation and available
quantum hardware systems. The implementation is open-source and can be found on
https://github.com/prince-ph0en1x/QuASeR.
"
1889,FPGA Based Emulation Environment for Neuromorphic Architectures,"  Neuromorphic architectures such as IBM's TrueNorth and Intel's Loihi have
been introduced as platforms for energy efficient spiking neural network
execution. However, there is no framework that allows for rapidly experimenting
with neuromorphic architectures and studying the trade space on hardware
performance and network accuracy. Fundamentally, this creates a barrier to
entry for hardware designers looking to explore neuromorphic architectures. In
this paper we present an open-source FPGA based emulation environment for
neuromorphic computing research. We prototype IBM's TrueNorth architecture as a
reference design and discuss FPGA specific design decisions made when
implementing and integrating it's core components. We conduct resource
utilization analysis and realize a streaming-enabled TrueNorth architecture on
the Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC. We then perform functional verification by
implementing networks for MNIST dataset and vector matrix multiplication (VMM)
in our emulation environment and present an accuracy-based comparison based on
the same networks generated using IBM's Compass simulation environment. We
demonstrate the utility of our emulation environment for hardware designers and
application engineers by altering the neuron behavior for VMM mapping, which
is, to the best of our knowledge, not feasible with any other tool including
IBM's Compass environment. The proposed parameterized and configurable
emulation platform serves as a basis for expanding its features to support
emerging architectures, studying hypothetical neuromorphic architectures, or
rapidly converging to hardware configuration through incremental changes based
on bottlenecks as they become apparent during application mapping process.
"
1890,"A Device Non-Ideality Resilient Approach for Mapping Neural Networks to
  Crossbar Arrays","  We propose a technology-independent method, referred to as adjacent
connection matrix (ACM), to efficiently map signed weight matrices to
non-negative crossbar arrays. When compared to same-hardware-overhead mapping
methods, using ACM leads to improvements of up to 20% in training accuracy for
ResNet-20 with the CIFAR-10 dataset when training with 5-bit precision crossbar
arrays or lower. When compared with strategies that use two elements to
represent a weight, ACM achieves comparable training accuracies, while also
offering area and read energy reductions of 2.3x and 7x, respectively. ACM also
has a mild regularization effect that improves inference accuracy in crossbar
arrays without any retraining or costly device/variation-aware training.
"
1891,Quantum circuit synthesis using Householder transformations,"  The synthesis of a quantum circuit consists in decomposing a unitary matrix
into a series of elementary operations. In this paper, we propose a circuit
synthesis method based on the QR factorization via Householder transformations.
We provide a two-step algorithm: during the first step we exploit the specific
structure of a quantum operator to compute its QR factorization, then the
factorized matrix is used to produce a quantum circuit. We analyze several
costs (circuit size and computational time) and compare them to existing
techniques from the literature. For a final quantum circuit twice as large as
the one obtained by the best existing method, we accelerate the computation by
orders of magnitude.
"
1892,Synthesizing quantum circuits via numerical optimization,"  We provide a simple framework for the synthesis of quantum circuits based on
a numerical optimization algorithm. This algorithm is used in the context of
the trapped-ions technology. We derive theoretical lower bounds for the number
of quantum gates required to implement any quantum algorithm. Then we present
numerical experiments with random quantum operators where we compute the
optimal parameters of the circuits and we illustrate the correctness of the
theoretical lower bounds. We finally discuss the scalability of the method with
the number of qubits.
"
1893,"Crosstalk Noise based Configurable Computing: A New Paradigm for Digital
  Electronics","  The past few decades have seen exponential growth in capabilities of digital
electronics primarily due to the ability to scale Integrated Circuits (ICs) to
smaller dimensions while attaining power and performance benefits. That
scalability is now being challenged due to the lack of scaled transistor
performance and also manufacturing complexities [1]-[5]. In addition, the
growing cyber threat in fabless manufacturing era poses a new front that modern
ICs need to withstand. We present a new noise based computing where the
interconnect interference between nanoscale metal lines is intentionally
engineered to exhibit programmable Boolean logic behavior. The reliance on just
coupling between metal lines and not on transistors for computing, and the
programmability are the foundations for better scalability, and security by
obscurity. Here, we show experimental evidence of a functioning Crosstalk
computing chip at 65nm technology. Our demonstration of computing constructs,
gate level configurability and utilization of foundry processes show
feasibility. These results in conjunction with our simulation results at 7nm
for various benchmarks, which show over 48%, 57%, and 10% density, power and
performance respectively, gains over equivalent CMOS in the best case, show
potentials. The benefits of Crosstalk circuits and inherent programmable
features set it apart and make it a promising prospect for future electronics.
"
1894,"Deep Echo State Networks for Short-Term Traffic Forecasting: Performance
  Comparison and Statistical Assessment","  In short-term traffic forecasting, the goal is to accurately predict future
values of a traffic parameter of interest occurring shortly after the
prediction is queried. The activity reported in this long-standing research
field has been lately dominated by different Deep Learning approaches, yielding
overly complex forecasting models that in general achieve accuracy gains of
questionable practical utility. In this work we elaborate on the performance of
Deep Echo State Networks for this particular task. The efficient learning
algorithm and simpler parametric configuration of these alternative modeling
approaches make them emerge as a competitive traffic forecasting method for
real ITS applications deployed in devices and systems with stringently limited
computational resources. An extensive comparison benchmark is designed with
real traffic data captured over the city of Madrid (Spain), amounting to more
than 130 automatic Traffic Readers (ATRs) and several shallow learning,
ensembles and Deep Learning models. Results from this comparison benchmark and
the analysis of the statistical significance of the reported performance gaps
are decisive: Deep Echo State Networks achieve more accurate traffic forecasts
than the rest of considered modeling counterparts.
"
1895,Advanced Equivalence Checking for Quantum Circuits,"  Quantum computing will change the way we tackle certain problems. It promises
to dramatically speed-up many chemical, financial, and machine-learning
applications. However, to capitalize on those promises, complex design flows
composed of steps such as compilation, decomposition, or mapping need to be
employed before being able to execute a conceptual quantum algorithm on an
actual device. This results in descriptions at various levels of abstraction
which may significantly differ from each other. The complexity of the
underlying design problems necessitates to not only provide efficient solutions
for the single steps, but also to verify that the originally intended
functionality is preserved throughout all levels of abstraction. This motivates
methods for equivalence checking of quantum circuits. However, most existing
methods are inspired by the classical realm and have merely been extended to
support quantum circuits (i.e., circuits which do not only rely on 0's and 1's,
but also employ superposition and entanglement). In this work, we propose an
advanced methodology which takes the different paradigms of quantum circuits
not only as a burden, but as an opportunity. In fact, the proposed methodology
explicitly utilizes characteristics unique to quantum computing in order to
overcome the shortcomings of existing approaches. We show that, by exploiting
the reversibility of quantum circuits, complexity can be kept feasible in many
cases. Moreover, we show that, in contrast to the classical realm, simulation
is very powerful in verifying quantum circuits. Experimental evaluations
confirm that the resulting methodology allows one to conduct equivalence
checking dramatically faster than ever before--in many cases just a single
simulation run is sufficient. An implementation of the proposed methodology is
publicly available at https://iic.jku.at/eda/research/quantum_verification/.
"
1896,"Wireless Power Transmitter Deployment for Balancing Fairness and
  Charging Service Quality","  Wireless Energy Transfer (WET) has recently emerged as an appealing solution
for power supplying mobile / Internet of Things (IoT) devices. As an enabling
WET technology, Resonant Beam Charging (RBC) is well-documented for its
long-range, high-power, and safe ""WiFi-like"" mobile power supply. To provide
high-quality wireless charging services for multi-user in a given region, we
formulate a deployment problem of multiple RBC transmitters for balancing the
charging fairness and quality of charging service. Based on the RBC
transmitter's coverage model and receiver's charging / discharging model, a
Genetic Algorithm (GA)-based and a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)-based
scheme are put forth to resolve the above issue. Moreover, we present a
scheduling method to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms.
Numerical results corroborate that the optimized deployment schemes outperform
uniform and random deployment in 10%-20% charging efficiency improvement.
"
1897,"MemTorch: An Open-source Simulation Framework for Memristive Deep
  Learning Systems","  Memristive devices have shown great promise to facilitate the acceleration
and improve the power efficiency of Deep Learning (DL) systems. Crossbar
architectures constructed using memristive devices can be used to efficiently
implement various in-memory computing operations, such as Multiply-Accumulate
(MAC) and unrolled-convolutions, which are used extensively in Deep Neural
Networks (DNNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Currently, there is a
lack of a modernized, open source and general high-level simulation platform
that can fully integrate any behavioral or experimental memristive device model
and its putative non-idealities into crossbar architectures within DL systems.
This paper presents such a framework, entitled MemTorch, which adopts a
modernized software engineering methodology and integrates directly with the
well-known PyTorch Machine Learning (ML) library. We fully detail the public
release of MemTorch and its release management, and use it to perform novel
simulations of memristive DL systems, which are trained and benchmarked using
the CIFAR-10 dataset. Moreover, we present a case study, in which MemTorch is
used to simulate a near-sensor in-memory computing system for seizure detection
using Pt/Hf/Ti Resistive Random Access Memory (ReRAM) devices. Our open source
MemTorch framework can be used and expanded upon by circuit and system
designers to conveniently perform customized large-scale memristive DL
simulations taking into account various unavoidable device non-idealities, as a
preliminary step before circuit-level realization.
"
1898,"Software-Level Accuracy Using Stochastic Computing With
  Charge-Trap-Flash Based Weight Matrix","  The in-memory computing paradigm with emerging memory devices has been
recently shown to be a promising way to accelerate deep learning. Resistive
processing unit (RPU) has been proposed to enable the vector-vector outer
product in a crossbar array using a stochastic train of identical pulses to
enable one-shot weight update, promising intense speed-up in matrix
multiplication operations, which form the bulk of training neural networks.
However, the performance of the system suffers if the device does not satisfy
the condition of linear conductance change over around 1,000 conductance
levels. This is a challenge for nanoscale memories. Recently, Charge Trap Flash
(CTF) memory was shown to have a large number of levels before saturation, but
variable non-linearity. In this paper, we explore the trade-off between the
range of conductance change and linearity. We show, through simulations, that
at an optimum choice of the range, our system performs nearly as well as the
models trained using exact floating point operations, with less than 1%
reduction in the performance. Our system reaches an accuracy of 97.9% on MNIST
dataset, 89.1% and 70.5% accuracy on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets (using
pre-extracted features). We also show its use in reinforcement learning, where
it is used for value function approximation in Q-Learning, and learns to
complete an episode the mountain car control problem in around 146 steps.
Benchmarked to state-of-the-art, the CTF based RPU shows best in class
performance to enable software equivalent performance.
"
1899,Preliminary Study of Connectivity for Quantum Key Distribution Network,"  Quantum network is fragile to disturbances when qubits are transmitted
through quantum channel. Reliability is an essential requirement for a quantum
network and even the future quantum internet. A metric is needed to describe
the reliability of a quantum network to build a robust infrastructure and
communication protocols. In this work, we combined quantum physical parameters
with graphic algebraic connectivity to indicate the transmission throughput of
a grid quantum network. This metric can be extended to multiple equal
point-to-point distance topology. This work also studies how to tune specific
physical parameters to maintain or even increase connectivity when nodes or
edges are removed from a network. Using this metric, resources consumption are
compared.
"
1900,"Resiliency Analysis and Improvement of Variational Quantum Factoring in
  Superconducting Qubit","  Variational algorithm using Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA)
can solve the prime factorization problem in near-term noisy quantum computers.
Conventional Variational Quantum Factoring (VQF) requires a large number of
2-qubit gates (especially for factoring a large number) resulting in deep
circuits. The output quality of the deep quantum circuit is degraded due to
errors limiting the computational power of quantum computing. In this paper, we
explore various transformations to optimize the QAOA circuit for integer
factorization. We propose two criteria to select the optimal quantum circuit
that can improve the noise resiliency of VQF.
"
1901,"Adaptive model selection in photonic reservoir computing by
  reinforcement learning","  Photonic reservoir computing is an emergent technology toward beyond-Neumann
computing. Although photonic reservoir computing provides superior performance
in environments whose characteristics are coincident with the training datasets
for the reservoir, the performance is significantly degraded if these
characteristics deviate from the original knowledge used in the training phase.
Here, we propose a scheme of adaptive model selection in photonic reservoir
computing using reinforcement learning. In this scheme, a temporal waveform is
generated by different dynamic source models that change over time. The system
autonomously identifies the best source model for the task of time series
prediction using photonic reservoir computing and reinforcement learning. We
prepare two types of output weights for the source models, and the system
adaptively selected the correct model using reinforcement learning, where the
prediction errors are associated with rewards. We succeed in adaptive model
selection when the source signal is temporally mixed, having originally been
generated by two different dynamic system models, as well as when the signal is
a mixture from the same model but with different parameter values. This study
paves the way for autonomous behavior in photonic artificial intelligence and
could lead to new applications in load forecasting and multi-objective control,
where frequent environment changes are expected.
"
1902,"Parameter Estimation in a Noisy 1D Environment via Two Absorbing
  Receivers","  This paper investigates the estimation of different parameters, e.g.,
propagation distance and flow velocity, by utilizing two fully-absorbing
receivers (RXs) in a one-dimensional (1D) environment. The time-varying number
of absorbed molecules at each RX and the number of absorbed molecules in a time
interval as time approaches infinity are derived. Noisy molecules in this
environment, that are released by sources in addition to the transmitter, are
also considered. A novel estimation method, namely difference estimation (DE),
is proposed to eliminate the effect of noise by using the difference of
received signals at the two RXs. For DE, the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) on
the variance of estimation is derived. Independent maximum likelihood
estimation is also considered at each RX as a benchmark to show the performance
advantage of DE. Aided by particle-based simulation, the derived analytical
results are verified. Furthermore, numerical results show that DE attains the
CRLB and is less sensitive to the change of noise than independent estimation
at each RX.
"
1903,"Implementation of a 12-Million Hodgkin-Huxley Neuron Network on a Single
  Chip","  Understanding the human brain is the biggest challenge for scientists in the
twenty-first century. The Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) model is one of the most
successful mathematical models for bio-realistic simulations of the brain.
However, the simulation of HH neurons involves complex computation, which makes
the implementation of large-scale brain networks difficult. In this paper, we
propose a hardware architecture that efficiently computes a large-scale network
of HH neurons. This architecture is based on the neuron machine hardware
architecture, which has the limitation of speed as it has only one computation
node. The proposed architecture is essentially a non-Von Neumann synchronous
system with multiple computation nodes, called hardware neurons, to achieve
linear speedup. In this paper, the design of a digital circuit that computes
large-scale networks of HH neurons is presented as an example to provide a
detailed description of the proposed architecture. This design supports axonal
conduction delay of spikes and short- and long-term plasticity synapses, along
with floating-point precision HH neurons. The design is implemented on a
field-programmable gate array (FPGA) chip and computes a network of one million
HH neurons in near real time. The implemented system can compute a network with
up to 12 million HH neurons and 600 million synapses. The proposed design
method can facilitate the design of systems supporting complex neuron models
and their flexible implementation on reconfigurable FPGA chips.
"
1904,"A System for Generating Non-Uniform Random Variates using Graphene
  Field-Effect Transistors","  We introduce a new method for hardware non-uniform random number generation
based on the transfer characteristics of graphene field-effect transistors
(GFETs) which requires as few as two transistors and a resistor (or
transimpedance amplifier). The method could be integrated into a custom
computing system to provide samples from arbitrary univariate distributions. We
also demonstrate the use of wavelet decomposition of the target distribution to
determine GFET bias voltages in a multi-GFET array.
  We implement the method by fabricating multiple GFETs and experimentally
validating that their transfer characteristics exhibit the nonlinearity on
which our method depends. We use the characterization data in simulations of a
proposed architecture for generating samples from dynamically-selectable
non-uniform probability distributions.
  Using a combination of experimental measurements of GFETs under a range of
biasing conditions and simulation of the GFET-based non-uniform random variate
generator architecture, we demonstrate a speedup of Monte Carlo integration by
a factor of up to 2$\times$. This speedup assumes the analog-to-digital
converters reading the outputs from the circuit can produce samples in the same
amount of time that it takes to perform memory accesses.
"
1905,"Memristors -- from In-memory computing, Deep Learning Acceleration,
  Spiking Neural Networks, to the Future of Neuromorphic and Bio-inspired
  Computing","  Machine learning, particularly in the form of deep learning, has driven most
of the recent fundamental developments in artificial intelligence. Deep
learning is based on computational models that are, to a certain extent,
bio-inspired, as they rely on networks of connected simple computing units
operating in parallel. Deep learning has been successfully applied in areas
such as object/pattern recognition, speech and natural language processing,
self-driving vehicles, intelligent self-diagnostics tools, autonomous robots,
knowledgeable personal assistants, and monitoring. These successes have been
mostly supported by three factors: availability of vast amounts of data,
continuous growth in computing power, and algorithmic innovations. The
approaching demise of Moore's law, and the consequent expected modest
improvements in computing power that can be achieved by scaling, raise the
question of whether the described progress will be slowed or halted due to
hardware limitations. This paper reviews the case for a novel beyond CMOS
hardware technology, memristors, as a potential solution for the implementation
of power-efficient in-memory computing, deep learning accelerators, and spiking
neural networks. Central themes are the reliance on non-von-Neumann computing
architectures and the need for developing tailored learning and inference
algorithms. To argue that lessons from biology can be useful in providing
directions for further progress in artificial intelligence, we briefly discuss
an example based reservoir computing. We conclude the review by speculating on
the big picture view of future neuromorphic and brain-inspired computing
systems.
"
1906,ROS: Resource-constrained Oracle Synthesis for Quantum Computers,"  We present a completely automatic synthesis framework for oracle functions, a
central part in many quantum algorithms. The proposed framework for
resource-constrained oracle synthesis (ROS) is a LUT-based hierarchical method
in which every step is specifically tailored to address hardware resource
constraints. ROS embeds a LUT mapper designed to simplify the successive
synthesis steps, costing each LUT according to the resources used by its
corresponding quantum circuit. In addition, the framework exploits a SAT-based
quantum garbage management technique. Those two characteristics give ROS the
ability to beat the state-of-the-art hierarchical method both in number of
qubits and in number of operations. The efficiency of the framework is
demonstrated by synthesizing quantum oracles for Grover's algorithm.
"
1907,"Rebooting Neuromorphic Hardware Design -- A Complexity Engineering
  Approach","  As the compute demands for machine learning and artificial intelligence
applications continue to grow, neuromorphic hardware has been touted as a
potential solution. New emerging devices like memristors, atomic switches, etc
have shown tremendous potential to replace CMOS-based circuits but have been
hindered by multiple challenges with respect to device variability, stochastic
behavior and scalability. In this paper we will introduce a
Description<->Design framework to analyze past successes in computing,
understand current problems and identify solutions moving forward. Engineering
systems with these emerging devices might require the modification of both the
type of descriptions of learning that we will design for, and the design
methodologies we employ in order to realize these new descriptions. We will
explore ideas from complexity engineering and analyze the advantages and
challenges they offer over traditional approaches to neuromorphic design with
novel computing fabrics. A reservoir computing example is used to understand
the specific changes that would accompany in moving towards a complexity
engineering approach. The time is ideal for a significant reboot of our design
methodologies and success will represent a radical shift in how neuromorphic
hardware is designed and pave the way for a new paradigm.
"
1908,"Electrically-Tunable Stochasticity for Spin-based Neuromorphic Circuits:
  Self-Adjusting to Variation","  Energy-efficient methods are addressed for leveraging low energy barrier
nanomagnetic devices within neuromorphic architectures. Using a
Magnetoresistive Random Access Memory (MRAM) probabilistic device (p-bit) as
the basis of neuronal structures in Deep Belief Networks (DBNs), the impact of
reducing the Magnetic Tunnel Junction's (MTJ's) energy barrier is assessed and
optimized for the resulting stochasticity present in the learning system. This
can mitigate the process variation sensitivity of stochastic DBNs which
encounter a sharp drop-off when energy barriers exceed near-zero kT. As
evaluated for the MNIST dataset for energy barriers at near-zero kT to 2.0 kT
in increments of 0.5 kT, it is shown that the stability factor changes by 5
orders of magnitude. The self-compensating circuit developed herein provides a
compact, and low complexity approach to mitigating process variation impacts
towards practical implementation and fabrication.
"
1909,"TIMELY: Pushing Data Movements and Interfaces in PIM Accelerators
  Towards Local and in Time Domain","  Resistive-random-access-memory (ReRAM) based processing-in-memory (R$^2$PIM)
accelerators show promise in bridging the gap between Internet of Thing
devices' constrained resources and Convolutional/Deep Neural Networks'
(CNNs/DNNs') prohibitive energy cost. Specifically, R$^2$PIM accelerators
enhance energy efficiency by eliminating the cost of weight movements and
improving the computational density through ReRAM's high density. However, the
energy efficiency is still limited by the dominant energy cost of input and
partial sum (Psum) movements and the cost of digital-to-analog (D/A) and
analog-to-digital (A/D) interfaces. In this work, we identify three
energy-saving opportunities in R$^2$PIM accelerators: analog data locality,
time-domain interfacing, and input access reduction, and propose an innovative
R$^2$PIM accelerator called TIMELY, with three key contributions: (1) TIMELY
adopts analog local buffers (ALBs) within ReRAM crossbars to greatly enhance
the data locality, minimizing the energy overheads of both input and Psum
movements; (2) TIMELY largely reduces the energy of each single D/A (and A/D)
conversion and the total number of conversions by using time-domain interfaces
(TDIs) and the employed ALBs, respectively; (3) we develop an only-once input
read (O$^2$IR) mapping method to further decrease the energy of input accesses
and the number of D/A conversions. The evaluation with more than 10 CNN/DNN
models and various chip configurations shows that, TIMELY outperforms the
baseline R$^2$PIM accelerator, PRIME, by one order of magnitude in energy
efficiency while maintaining better computational density (up to 31.2$\times$)
and throughput (up to 736.6$\times$). Furthermore, comprehensive studies are
performed to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed ALB, TDI, and O$^2$IR
innovations in terms of energy savings and area reduction.

1910,"Microfluidic QCSK Transmitter and Receiver Design for Molecular
  Communication","  The design of components with molecular communication (MC) functionalities
can bring an opportunity to enable some emerging applications in fields from
personal healthcare to modern industry. In this paper, we propose the designs
of the microfluidic transmitter and receiver with quadruple concentration shift
keying (QCSK) modulation and demodulation functionalities. To do so, we first
present an AND gate design, and then apply it to the QCSK transmitter and
receiver design. The QCSK transmitter is capable of modulating two input
signals to four different concentration levels, and the QCSK receiver can
demodulate a received signal to two outputs. More importantly, we also
establish a mathematical framework to theoretically characterize our proposed
microfluidic circuits. Based on this, we first derive the output concentration
distribution of our proposed AND gate design, and provide the insight into the
selection of design parameters to ensure an exhibition of desired behaviour. We
further derive the output concentration distributions of the QCSK transmitter
and receiver. Simulation results obtained in COMSOL Multiphysics not only show
the desired behaviour of all the proposed microfluidic circuits, but also
demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed mathematical framework.
"
1911,"Low Power In-Memory Implementation of Ternary Neural Networks with
  Resistive RAM-Based Synapse","  The design of systems implementing low precision neural networks with
emerging memories such as resistive random access memory (RRAM) is a major lead
for reducing the energy consumption of artificial intelligence (AI). Multiple
works have for example proposed in-memory architectures to implement low power
binarized neural networks. These simple neural networks, where synaptic weights
and neuronal activations assume binary values, can indeed approach
state-of-the-art performance on vision tasks. In this work, we revisit one of
these architectures where synapses are implemented in a differential fashion to
reduce bit errors, and synaptic weights are read using precharge sense
amplifiers. Based on experimental measurements on a hybrid 130 nm CMOS/RRAM
chip and on circuit simulation, we show that the same memory array architecture
can be used to implement ternary weights instead of binary weights, and that
this technique is particularly appropriate if the sense amplifier is operated
in near-threshold regime. We also show based on neural network simulation on
the CIFAR-10 image recognition task that going from binary to ternary neural
networks significantly increases neural network performance. These results
highlight that AI circuits function may sometimes be revisited when operated in
low power regimes.

1912,"One-step regression and classification with crosspoint resistive memory
  arrays","  Machine learning has been getting a large attention in the recent years, as a
tool to process big data generated by ubiquitous sensors in our daily life.
High speed, low energy computing machines are in demand to enable real-time
artificial intelligence at the edge, i.e., without the support of a remote
frame server in the cloud. Such requirements challenge the complementary
metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology, which is limited by the Moore's
law approaching its end and the communication bottleneck in conventional
computing architecture. Novel computing concepts, architectures and devices are
thus strongly needed to accelerate data-intensive applications. Here we show a
crosspoint resistive memory circuit with feedback configuration can execute
linear regression and logistic regression in just one step by computing the
pseudoinverse matrix of the data within the memory. The most elementary
learning operation, that is the regression of a sequence of data and the
classification of a set of data, can thus be executed in one single
computational step by the novel technology. One-step learning is further
supported by simulations of the prediction of the cost of a house in Boston and
the training of a 2-layer neural network for MNIST digit recognition. The
results are all obtained in one computational step, thanks to the physical,
parallel, and analog computing within the crosspoint array.
"
1913,Nanotechnology-inspired Information Processing Systems of the Future,"  Nanoscale semiconductor technology has been a key enabler of the computing
revolution. It has done so via advances in new materials and manufacturing
processes that resulted in the size of the basic building block of computing
systems - the logic switch and memory devices - being reduced into the
nanoscale regime. Nanotechnology has provided increased computing functionality
per unit volume, energy, and cost. In order for computing systems to continue
to deliver substantial benefits for the foreseeable future to society at large,
it is critical that the very notion of computing be examined in the light of
nanoscale realities. In particular, one needs to ask what it means to compute
when the very building block - the logic switch - no longer exhibits the level
of determinism required by the von Neumann architecture. There needs to be a
sustained and heavy investment in a nation-wide Vertically Integrated
Semiconductor Ecosystem (VISE). VISE is a program in which research and
development is conducted seamlessly across the entire compute stack - from
applications, systems and algorithms, architectures, circuits and nanodevices,
and materials. A nation-wide VISE provides clear strategic advantages in
ensuring the US's global superiority in semiconductors. First, a VISE provides
the highest quality seed-corn for nurturing transformative ideas that are
critically needed today in order for nanotechnology-inspired computing to
flourish. It does so by dramatically opening up new areas of semiconductor
research that are inspired and driven by new application needs. Second, a VISE
creates a very high barrier to entry from foreign competitors because it is
extremely hard to establish, and even harder to duplicate.
"
1914,Compact Device Models for FinFET and Beyond,"  Compact device models play a significant role in connecting device technology
and circuit design. BSIM-CMG and BSIM-IMG are industry standard compact models
suited for the FinFET and UTBB technologies, respectively. Its surface
potential based modeling framework and symmetry preserving properties make them
suitable for both analog/RF and digital design. In the era of artificial
intelligence / deep learning, compact models further enhanced our ability to
explore RRAM and other NVM-based neuromorphic circuits. We have demonstrated
simulation of RRAM neuromorphic circuits with Verilog-A based compact model at
NCKU. Further abstraction with macromodels is performed to enable larger scale
machine learning simulation.
"
1915,Pay as You Go: A Generic Crypto Tolling Architecture,"  The imminent pervasive adoption of vehicular communication, based on
dedicated short-range technology (ETSI ITS G5 or IEEE WAVE), 5G, or both, will
foster a richer service ecosystem for vehicular applications. The appearance of
new cryptography based solutions envisaging digital identity and currency
exchange are set to stem new approaches for existing and future challenges.
This paper presents a novel tolling architecture that harnesses the
availability of 5G C-V2X connectivity for open road tolling using smartphones,
IOTA as the digital currency and Hyperledger Indy for identity validation. An
experimental feasibility analysis is used to validate the proposed architecture
for secure, private and convenient electronic toll payment.
"
1916,"A Gentle Introduction to Quantum Computing Algorithms with Applications
  to Universal Prediction","  In this technical report we give an elementary introduction to Quantum
Computing for non-physicists. In this introduction we describe in detail some
of the foundational Quantum Algorithms including: the Deutsch-Jozsa Algorithm,
Shor's Algorithm, Grocer Search, and Quantum Counting Algorithm and briefly the
Harrow-Lloyd Algorithm. Additionally we give an introduction to Solomonoff
Induction, a theoretically optimal method for prediction. We then attempt to
use Quantum computing to find better algorithms for the approximation of
Solomonoff Induction. This is done by using techniques from other Quantum
computing algorithms to achieve a speedup in computing the speed prior, which
is an approximation of Solomonoff's prior, a key part of Solomonoff Induction.
The major limiting factors are that the probabilities being computed are often
so small that without a sufficient (often large) amount of trials, the error
may be larger than the result. If a substantial speedup in the computation of
an approximation of Solomonoff Induction can be achieved through quantum
computing, then this can be applied to the field of intelligent agents as a key
part of an approximation of the agent AIXI.
"
1917,"Computing with bricks and mortar: Classification of waveforms with a
  doped concrete blocks","  We present results showing the capability of concrete-based information
processing substrate in the signal classification task in accordance with in
materio computing paradigm. As the Reservoir Computing is a suitable model for
describing embedded in materio computation, we propose that this type of
presented basic construction unit can be used as a source for ""reservoir of
states"" necessary for simple tuning of the readout layer. In that perspective,
buildings constructed from computing concrete could function as a highly
parallel information processor for smart architecture. We present an electrical
characterization of the set of samples with different additive concentrations
followed by a dynamical analysis of selected specimens showing fingerprints of
memfractive properties. Moreover, on the basis of obtained parameters,
classification of the signal waveform shapes can be performed in scenarios
explicitly tuned for a given device terminal.
"
1918,A Neuromorphic Paradigm for Online Unsupervised Clustering,"  A computational paradigm based on neuroscientific concepts is proposed and
shown to be capable of online unsupervised clustering. Because it is an online
method, it is readily amenable to streaming realtime applications and is
capable of dynamically adjusting to macro-level input changes. All operations,
both training and inference, are localized and efficient. The paradigm is
implemented as a cognitive column that incorporates five key elements: 1)
temporal coding, 2) an excitatory neuron model for inference, 3)
winner-take-all inhibition, 4) a column architecture that combines excitation
and inhibition, 5) localized training via spike timing de-pendent plasticity
(STDP). These elements are described and discussed, and a prototype column is
given. The prototype column is simulated with a semi-synthetic benchmark and is
shown to have performance characteristics on par with classic k-means.
Simulations reveal the inner operation and capabilities of the column with
emphasis on excitatory neuron response functions and STDP implementations.
"
1919,Time complexity of in-memory solution of linear systems,"  In-memory computing with crosspoint resistive memory arrays has been shown to
accelerate data-centric computations such as the training and inference of deep
neural networks, thanks to the high parallelism endowed by physical rules in
the electrical circuits. By connecting crosspoint arrays with negative feedback
amplifiers, it is possible to solve linear algebraic problems such as linear
systems and matrix eigenvectors in just one step. Based on the theory of
feedback circuits, we study the dynamics of the solution of linear systems
within a memory array, showing that the time complexity of the solution is free
of any direct dependence on the problem size N, rather it is governed by the
minimal eigenvalue of an associated matrix of the coefficient matrix. We show
that, when the linear system is modeled by a covariance matrix, the time
complexity is O(logN) or O(1). In the case of sparse positive-definite linear
systems, the time complexity is solely determined by the minimal eigenvalue of
the coefficient matrix. These results demonstrate the high speed of the circuit
for solving linear systems in a wide range of applications, thus supporting
in-memory computing as a strong candidate for future big data and machine
learning accelerators.
"
1920,In-memory eigenvector computation in time O(1),"  In-memory computing with crosspoint resistive memory arrays has gained
enormous attention to accelerate the matrix-vector multiplication in the
computation of data-centric applications. By combining a crosspoint array and
feedback amplifiers, it is possible to compute matrix eigenvectors in one step
without algorithmic iterations. In this work, time complexity of the
eigenvector computation is investigated, based on the feedback analysis of the
crosspoint circuit. The results show that the computing time of the circuit is
determined by the mismatch degree of the eigenvalues implemented in the
circuit, which controls the rising speed of output voltages. For a dataset of
random matrices, the time for computing the dominant eigenvector in the circuit
is constant for various matrix sizes, namely the time complexity is O(1). The
O(1) time complexity is also supported by simulations of PageRank of real-world
datasets. This work paves the way for fast, energy-efficient accelerators for
eigenvector computation in a wide range of practical applications.
"
1921,"Quantum Annealing-Based Software Components: An Experimental Case Study
  with SAT Solving","  Quantum computers have the potential of solving problems more efficiently
than classical computers. While first commercial prototypes have become
available, the performance of such machines in practical application is still
subject to exploration. Quantum computers will not entirely replace classical
machines, but serve as accelerators for specific problems. This necessitates
integrating quantum computational primitives into existing applications.
  In this paper, we perform a case study on how to augment existing software
with quantum computational primitives for the Boolean satisfiability problem
(SAT) implemented using a quantum annealer (QA). We discuss relevant quality
measures for quantum components, and show that mathematically equivalent, but
structurally different ways of transforming SAT to a QA can lead to substantial
differences regarding these qualities. We argue that engineers need to be aware
that (and which) details, although they may be less relevant in traditional
software engineering, require considerable attention in quantum computing.
"
1922,"Creative Quantum Computing: Inverse FFT, Sound Synthesis, Adaptive
  Sequencing and Musical Composition","  Quantum computing is emerging as an alternative computing technology, which
is built on the principles of subatomic physics. In spite of continuing
progress in developing increasingly more sophisticated hardware and software,
access to quantum computing still requires specialist expertise that is largely
confined to research laboratories. Moreover, the target applications for these
developments remain primarily scientific. This chapter introduces research
aimed at improving this scenario. Our research is aimed at extending the range
of applications of quantum computing towards the arts and creative
applications, music being our point of departure. This chapter reports on
initial outcomes, whereby quantum information processing controls an inverse
Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) sound synthesizer and an adaptive musical
sequencer. A composition called Zeno is presented to illustrate a practical
real-world application.
"
1923,"Artificial life properties of directed interaction combinators vs.
  chemlambda","  We provide a framework for experimentation at
https://mbuliga.github.io/quinegraphs/ic-vs-chem.html#icvschem with two
artificial chemistries: directed interaction combinators (dirIC, defined in
section 2) and chemlambda. We are interested if these chemistries allow for
artificial life behaviour: replication, metabolism and death.
  The main conclusion of these experiments is that graph rewrites systems which
allow conflicting rewrites are better than those which don't, as concerns their
artificial life properties. This is in contradiction with the search for good
graph rewrite systems for decentralized computing, where non-conflicting graph
rewrite systems are historically preferred.
  This continues the artificial chemistry experiments with chemlambda, lambda
calculus or interaction combinators, available from the entry page at
https://chemlambda.github.io/index.html and described in arXiv:2003.14332.
"
1924,"A 28-nm Convolutional Neuromorphic Processor Enabling Online Learning
  with Spike-Based Retinas","  In an attempt to follow biological information representation and
organization principles, the field of neuromorphic engineering is usually
approached bottom-up, from the biophysical models to large-scale integration in
silico. While ideal as experimentation platforms for cognitive computing and
neuroscience, bottom-up neuromorphic processors have yet to demonstrate an
efficiency advantage compared to specialized neural network accelerators for
real-world problems. Top-down approaches aim at answering this difficulty by
(i) starting from the applicative problem and (ii) investigating how to make
the associated algorithms hardware-efficient and biologically-plausible. In
order to leverage the data sparsity of spike-based neuromorphic retinas for
adaptive edge computing and vision applications, we follow a top-down approach
and propose SPOON, a 28-nm event-driven CNN (eCNN). It embeds online learning
with only 16.8-% power and 11.8-% area overheads with the
biologically-plausible direct random target projection (DRTP) algorithm. With
an energy per classification of 313nJ at 0.6V and a 0.32-mm$^2$ area for
accuracies of 95.3% (on-chip training) and 97.5% (off-chip training) on MNIST,
we demonstrate that SPOON reaches the efficiency of conventional machine
learning accelerators while embedding on-chip learning and being compatible
with event-based sensors, a point that we further emphasize with N-MNIST
benchmarking.
"
1925,"Optimizing Quantum Search Using a Generalized Version of Grover's
  Algorithm","  Grover's Search algorithm was a breakthrough at the time it was introduced,
and its underlying procedure of amplitude amplification has been a building
block of many other algorithms and patterns for extracting information encoded
in quantum states. In this paper, we introduce an optimization of the
inversion-by-the-mean step of the algorithm. This optimization serves two
purposes: from a practical perspective, it can lead to a performance
improvement; from a theoretical one, it leads to a novel interpretation of the
actual nature of this step. This step is a reflection, which is realized by (a)
cancelling the superposition of a general state to revert to the original
all-zeros state, (b) flipping the sign of the amplitude of the all-zeros state,
and finally (c) reverting back to the superposition state. Rather than
canceling the superposition, our approach allows for going forward to another
state that makes the reflection easier. We validate our approach on set and
array search, and confirm our results experimentally on real quantum hardware.
"
1926,A quantum procedure for map generation,"  Quantum computation is an emerging technology that promises a wide range of
possible use cases. This promise is primarily based on algorithms that are
unlikely to be viable over the coming decade. For near-term applications,
quantum software needs to be carefully tailored to the hardware available. In
this paper, we begin to explore whether near-term quantum computers could
provide tools that are useful in the creation and implementation of computer
games. The procedural generation of geopolitical maps and their associated
history is considered as a motivating example. This is performed by encoding a
rudimentary decision making process for the nations within a quantum procedure
that is well-suited to near-term devices. Given the novelty of quantum
computing within the field of procedural generation, we also provide an
introduction to the basic concepts involved.
"
1927,On memfractance of plants and fungi,"  The key feature of a memristor is that the resistance is a function of its
previous resistance, thereby the behaviour of the device is influenced by
changing the way in which potential is applied across it. Ultimately,
information can be encoded on memristors, which can then be used to implement a
number of circuit topologies. Biological substrates have already been shown to
exhibit some memristive properties. It is, therefore, logical that all
biological media will follow this trend to some degree. In this paper we
demonstrate that a range of yet untested specimens exhibit memristive
properties, including mediums such as water and dampened wood shavings on which
we can cultivate biological specimens. We propose that memristance is not a
binary property {0,1}, but rather a continuum on the scale [0,1]. The results
imply that there is great potential for hybrid electronic systems that combine
traditional electronic typologies with naturally occurring specimens.
"
1928,Temporal Memory with Magnetic Racetracks,"  Race logic is a relative timing code that represents information in a
wavefront of digital edges on a set of wires in order to accelerate dynamic
programming and machine learning algorithms. Skyrmions, bubbles, and domain
walls are mobile magnetic configurations (solitons) with applications for
Boolean data storage. We propose to use current-induced displacement of these
solitons on magnetic racetracks as a native temporal memory for race logic
computing. Locally synchronized racetracks can spatially store relative timings
of digital edges and provide non-destructive read-out. The linear kinematics of
skyrmion motion, the tunability and low-voltage asynchronous operation of the
proposed device, and the elimination of any need for constant skyrmion
nucleation make these magnetic racetracks a natural memory for low-power,
high-throughput race logic applications.
"
1929,Coherent Ising machines with error correction feedback,"  A non-equilibrium open-dissipative neural network, such as a coherent Ising
machine based on mutually coupled optical parametric oscillators, has been
proposed and demonstrated as a novel computing machine for hard combinatorial
optimization problems. However, there are two challenges in the previously
proposed approach: (1) The machine can be trapped by local minima which
increases exponentially with problem size and (2) the machine fails to map a
target Hamiltonian correctly on the loss landscape of a neural network due to
oscillator amplitude heterogeneity. Both of them lead to erroneous solutions
rather than correct answers. In this paper, we show that it is possible to
overcome these two problems partially but simultaneously by introducing error
detection and correction feedback mechanism. The proposed machine achieves
efficient sampling of degenerate ground states and low-energy excited states
via its inherent migration property during a solution search process.
"
1930,"QCI Qbsolv Delivers Strong Classical Performance for Quantum-Ready
  Formulation","  Many organizations that vitally depend on computation for their competitive
advantage are keen to exploit the expected performance of quantum computers
(QCs) as soon as quantum advantage is achieved. The best approach to deliver
hardware quantum advantage for high-value problems is not yet clear. This work
advocates establishing quantum-ready applications and underlying tools and
formulations, so that software development can proceed now to ensure being
ready for quantum advantage. This work can be done independently of which
hardware approach delivers quantum advantage first. The quadratic unconstrained
binary optimization (QUBO) problem is one such quantum-ready formulation. We
developed the next generation of qbsolv, a tool that is widely used for
sampling QUBOs on early QCs, focusing on its performance executing purely
classically, and deliver it as a cloud service today. We find that it delivers
highly competitive results in all of quality (low energy value), speed (time to
solution), and diversity (variety of solutions). We believe these results give
quantum-forward users a reason to switch to quantum-ready formulations today,
reaping immediate benefits in performance and diversity of solution from the
quantum-ready formulation,preparing themselves for quantum advantage, and
accelerating the development of the quantum computing ecosystem.
"
1931,"scadnano: A browser-based, scriptable tool for designing DNA
  nanostructures","  We introduce $\textit{scadnano}$ (https://scadnano.org) (short for
""scriptable cadnano""), a computational tool for designing synthetic DNA
structures. Its design is based heavily on cadnano, the most widely-used
software for designing DNA origami, with three main differences:
  1. scadnano runs entirely in the browser, with $\textit{no software
installation}$ required.
  2. scadnano designs, while they can be edited manually, can also be created
and edited by a $\textit{well-documented Python scripting library}$, to help
automate tedious tasks.
  3. The scadnano file format is $\textit{easily human-readable}$. This goal is
closely aligned with the scripting library, intended to be helpful when
debugging scripts or interfacing with other software. The format is also
somewhat more expressive than that of cadnano, able to describe a broader range
of DNA structures than just DNA origami.
"
1932,Time-Sliced Quantum Circuit Partitioning for Modular Architectures,"  Current quantum computer designs will not scale. To scale beyond small
prototypes, quantum architectures will likely adopt a modular approach with
clusters of tightly connected quantum bits and sparser connections between
clusters. We exploit this clustering and the statically-known control flow of
quantum programs to create tractable partitioning heuristics which map quantum
circuits to modular physical machines one time slice at a time. Specifically,
we create optimized mappings for each time slice, accounting for the cost to
move data from the previous time slice and using a tunable lookahead scheme to
reduce the cost to move to future time slices. We compare our approach to a
traditional statically-mapped, owner-computes model. Our results show strict
improvement over the static mapping baseline. We reduce the non-local
communication overhead by 89.8\% in the best case and by 60.9\% on average. Our
techniques, unlike many exact solver methods, are computationally tractable.
"
1933,Quantum Circuits for Functionally Controlled NOT Gates,"  We generalize quantum circuits for the Toffoli gate presented by Selinger and
Jones for functionally controlled NOT gates, i.e., $X$ gates controlled by
arbitrary $n$-variable Boolean functions. Our constructions target the gate set
consisting of Clifford gates and single qubit rotations by arbitrary angles.
Our constructions use the Walsh-Hadamard spectrum of Boolean functions and
build on the work by Schuch and Siewert and Welch et al. We present quantum
circuits for the case where the target qubit is in an arbitrary state as well
as the special case where the target is in a known state. Additionally, we
present constructions that require no auxiliary qubits and constructions that
have a rotation depth of 1.
"
1934,A Physical Channel Model for Wired Nano-Communication Networks,"  In this paper, we propose a new end-to-end system for wired
nano-communication networks using a self-assembled polymer. The self-assembly
of a polymer creates a channel between the transmitter and the receiver in the
form of a conductive nanowire that uses electrons as carriers of information.
We derive the channel's analytical model and its master equation to study the
dynamic process of the polymer self-assembly. We validate the analytical model
with numerical and Monte-Carlo simulations. Then, we approximate the master
equation by a one-dimensional Fokker-Planck equation and we solve this equation
analytically and numerically. We formulate the expressions of the polymer
elongation rate, its diffusion coefficient and the nullcline to study the
distribution and the stability of the self-assembled nanowire. This study shows
promising results for realizing stable polymer-based wired nanonetworks that
can achieve high throughput.
"
1935,Experimental evaluation of quantum Bayesian networks on IBM QX hardware,"  Bayesian Networks (BN) are probabilistic graphical models that are widely
used for uncertainty modeling, stochastic prediction and probabilistic
inference. A Quantum Bayesian Network (QBN) is a quantum version of the
Bayesian network that utilizes the principles of quantum mechanical systems to
improve the computational performance of various analyses. In this paper, we
experimentally evaluate the performance of QBN on various IBM QX hardware
against Qiskit simulator and classical analysis. We consider a 4-node BN for
stock prediction for our experimental evaluation. We construct a quantum
circuit to represent the 4-node BN using Qiskit, and run the circuit on nine
IBM quantum devices: Yorktown, Vigo, Ourense, Essex, Burlington, London, Rome,
Athens and Melbourne. We will also compare the performance of each device
across the four levels of optimization performed by the IBM Transpiler when
mapping a given quantum circuit to a given device. We use the root mean square
percentage error as the metric for performance comparison of various hardware.
"
1936,"A Quantum Annealing Approach for Dynamic Multi-Depot Capacitated Vehicle
  Routing Problem","  Quantum annealing (QA) is a quantum computing algorithm that works on the
principle of Adiabatic Quantum Computation (AQC), and it has shown significant
computational advantages in solving combinatorial optimization problems such as
vehicle routing problems (VRP) when compared to classical algorithms. This
paper presents a QA approach for solving a variant VRP known as multi-depot
capacitated vehicle routing problem (MDCVRP). This is an NP-hard optimization
problem with real-world applications in the fields of transportation,
logistics, and supply chain management. We consider heterogeneous depots and
vehicles with different capacities. Given a set of heterogeneous depots, the
number of vehicles in each depot, heterogeneous depot/vehicle capacities, and a
set of spatially distributed customer locations, the MDCVRP attempts to
identify routes of various vehicles satisfying the capacity constraints such as
that all the customers are served. We model MDCVRP as a quadratic unconstrained
binary optimization (QUBO) problem, which minimizes the overall distance
traveled by all the vehicles across all depots given the capacity constraints.
Furthermore, we formulate a QUBO model for dynamic version of MDCVRP known as
D-MDCVRP, which involves dynamic rerouting of vehicles to real-time customer
requests. We discuss the problem complexity and a solution approach to solving
MDCVRP and D-MDCVRP on quantum annealing hardware from D-Wave.
"
1937,Just-in-time Quantum Circuit Transpilation Reduces Noise,"  Running quantum programs is fraught with challenges on on today's noisy
intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) devices. Many of these challenges originate
from the error characteristics that stem from rapid decoherence and noise
during measurement, qubit connections, crosstalk, the qubits themselves, and
transformations of qubit state via gates. Not only are qubits not ""created
equal"", but their noise level also changes over time. IBM is said to calibrate
their quantum systems once per day and reports noise levels (errors) at the
time of such calibration. This information is subsequently used to map circuits
to higher quality qubits and connections up to the next calibration point.
  This work provides evidence that there is room for improvement over this
daily calibration cycle. It contributes a technique to measure noise levels
(errors) related to qubits immediately before executing one or more sensitive
circuits and shows that just-in-time noise measurements benefit late physical
qubit mappings. With this just-in-time recalibrated transpilation, the fidelity
of results is improved over IBM's default mappings, which only uses their daily
calibrations. The framework assess two major sources of noise, namely readout
errors (measurement errors) and two-qubit gate/connection errors. Experiments
indicate that the accuracy of circuit results improves by 3-304% on average and
up to 400% with on-the-fly circuit mappings based on error measurements just
prior to application execution.
"
1938,"Arm order recognition in multi-armed bandit problem with laser chaos
  time series","  By exploiting ultrafast and irregular time series generated by lasers with
delayed feedback, we have previously demonstrated a scalable algorithm to solve
multi-armed bandit (MAB) problems utilizing the time-division multiplexing of
laser chaos time series. Although the algorithm detects the arm with the
highest reward expectation, the correct recognition of the order of arms in
terms of reward expectations is not achievable. Here, we present an algorithm
where the degree of exploration is adaptively controlled based on confidence
intervals that represent the estimation accuracy of reward expectations. We
have demonstrated numerically that our approach did improve arm order
recognition accuracy significantly, along with reduced dependence on reward
environments, and the total reward is almost maintained compared with
conventional MAB methods. This study applies to sectors where the order
information is critical, such as efficient allocation of resources in
information and communications technology.
"
1939,Limitations on counting in Boolean circuits and self-assembly,"  In self-assembly, a $k$-counter is a tile set that grows a horizontal ruler
from left to right, containing $k$ columns each of which encodes a distinct
binary string. Counters have been fundamental objects of study in a wide range
of theoretical models of tile assembly, molecular robotics and
thermodynamics-based self-assembly due to their construction capabilities using
few tile types, time-efficiency of growth and combinatorial structure. Here, we
define a Boolean circuit model, called $n$-wire local railway circuits, where
$n$ parallel wires are straddled by Boolean gates, each with matching
fanin/fanout strictly less than $n$, and we show that such a model can not
count to $2^n$ nor implement any so-called odd bijective nor quasi-bijective
function. We then define a class of self-assembly systems that includes
theoretically interesting and experimentally-implemented systems that compute
$n$-bit functions and count layer-by-layer. We apply our Boolean circuit result
to show that those self-assembly systems can not count to $2^n$. This explains
why the experimentally implemented iterated Boolean circuit model of tile
assembly can not count to $2^n$, yet some previously studied tile system do.
Our work points the way to understanding the kinds of features required from
self-assembly and Boolean circuits to implement maximal counters.
"
1940,Molecular MUX-Based Physical Unclonable Functions,"  Physical unclonable functions (PUFs) are small circuits that are widely used
as hardware security primitives for authentication. These circuits can generate
unique signatures because of the inherent randomness in manufacturing and
process variations. This paper introduces molecular PUFs based on multiplexer
(MUX) PUFs using dual-rail representation. It may be noted that molecular PUFs
have not been presented before. Each molecular multiplexer is synthesized using
16 molecular reactions. The intrinsic variations of the rate constants of the
molecular reactions are assumed to provide inherent randomness necessary for
uniqueness of PUFs. Based on Gaussian distribution of the rate constants of the
reactions, this paper simulates intra-chip and inter-chip variations of linear
molecular MUX PUFs containing 8, 16, 32 and 64 stages. These variations are,
respectively, used to compute reliability and uniqueness. It is shown that, for
the rate constants used in this paper, although 8-state molecular MUX PUFs are
not useful as PUFs, PUFs containing 16 or higher stages are useful as molecular
PUFs. Like electronic PUFs, increasing the number of stages increases
uniqueness and reliability of the PUFs
"
1941,Logic Verification of Ultra-Deep Pipelined Beyond-CMOS Technologies,"  Traditional logical equivalence checking (LEC) which plays a major role in
entire chip design process faces challenges of meeting the requirements
demanded by the many emerging technologies that are based on logic models
different from standard complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS). In this
paper, we propose a LEC framework to be employed in the verification process of
beyond-CMOS circuits. Our LEC framework is compatible with existing CMOS
technologies, but, also able to check features and capabilities that are unique
to beyond-CMOS technologies. For instance, the performance of some emerging
technologies benefits from ultra-deep pipelining and verification of such
circuits requires new models and algorithms. We, therefore, present the
Multi-Cycle Input Dependency (MCID) circuit model which is a novel model
representation of design to explicitly capture the dependency of primary
outputs of the circuit on sequences of internal signals and inputs. Embedding
the proposed circuit model and several structural checking modules, the process
of verification can be independent of the underlying technology and signaling.
We benchmark the proposed framework on post-synthesis rapid single-flux-quantum
(RSFQ) netlists. Results show a comparative verification time of RSFQ circuit
benchmark including 32-bit Kogge-Stone adder, 16-bit integer divider, and
ISCAS'85 circuits with respect to ABC tool for similar CMOS circuits.
"
1942,"Pattern Denoising in Molecular Associative Memory using Pairwise Markov
  Random Field Models","  We propose an in silico molecular associative memory model for pattern
learning, storage and denoising using Pairwise Markov Random Field (PMRF)
model. Our PMRF-based molecular associative memory model extracts locally
distributed features from the exposed examples, learns and stores the patterns
in the molecular associative memory and denoises the given noisy patterns via
DNA computation based operations. Thus, our computational molecular model
demonstrates the functionalities of content-addressability of human memory. Our
molecular simulation results show that the averaged mean squared error between
the learned and denoised patterns are low (< 0.014) up to 30% of noise.
"
1943,"3D logic cells design and results based on Vertical NWFET technology
  including tied compact model","  Gate-all-around Vertical Nanowire Field Effect Transistors (VNWFET) are
emerging devices, which are well suited to pursue scaling beyond lateral
scaling limitations around 7nm. This work explores the relative merits and
drawbacks of the technology in the context of logic cell design. We describe a
junctionless nanowire technology and associated compact model, which accurately
describes fabricated device behavior in all regions of operations for
transistors based on between 16 and 625 parallel nanowires of diameters between
22 and 50nm. We used this model to simulate the projected performance of
inverter logic gates based on passive load, active load and complementary
topologies and carry out an performance exploration for the number of nanowires
in transistors. In terms of compactness, through a dedicated full 3D layout
design, we also demonstrate a 1.4x reduction in lateral dimensions for the
complementary structure with respect to 7nm FinFET-based inverters.

1944,Scalable spin-glass optical simulator,"  Many developments in science and engineering depend on tackling complex
optimizations on large scales. The challenge motivates intense search for
specific computing hardware that takes advantage from quantum features [1, 2],
stochastic elements [3], nonlinear dissipative dynamics [4-8], in-memory
operations [9, 10], or photonics [11-14]. A paradigmatic optimization problem
is finding low-energy states in classical spin systems with fully-random
interactions [15-18]. To date no alternative computing platform can address
such spin-glass problems on a large scale. Here we propose and realize an
optical scalable spin-glass simulator based on spatial light modulation and
multiple light scattering. By tailoring optical transmission through a
disordered medium, we optically accelerate the computation of the ground state
of large spin networks with all-to-all random couplings. Scaling of the
operation time with the problem size demonstrates optical advantage over
conventional computing. Our results provide a general route towards large-scale
computing that exploits speed, parallelism and coherence of light [19-23].
"
1945,Quantum Accelerated Estimation of Algorithmic Information,"  In this research we present a quantum circuit for estimating algorithmic
information metrics like the universal prior distribution. This accelerates
inferring algorithmic structure in data for discovering causal generative
models. The computation model is restricted in time and space resources to make
it computable in approximating the target metrics. A classical exhaustive
enumeration is shown for a few examples. The precise quantum circuit design
that allows executing a superposition of automata is presented. As a use-case,
an application framework for experimenting on DNA sequences for meta-biology is
proposed. To our knowledge, this is the first time approximating algorithmic
information is implemented for quantum computation. Our implementation on the
OpenQL quantum programming language and the QX Simulator is copy-left and can
be found on https://github.com/Advanced-Research-Centre/QuBio.

1946,SOT-MRAM based Sigmoidal Neuron for Neuromorphic Architectures,"  In this paper, the intrinsic physical characteristics of spin-orbit torque
(SOT) magnetoresistive random-access memory (MRAM) devices are leveraged to
realize sigmoidal neurons in neuromorphic architectures. Performance
comparisons with the previous power- and area-efficient sigmoidal neuron
circuits exhibit 74x and 12x reduction in power-area-product values for the
proposed SOT-MRAM based neuron. To verify the functionally of the proposed
neuron within larger scale designs, we have implemented a circuit realization
of a 784x16x10 SOT-MRAM based multiplayer perceptron (MLP) for MNIST pattern
recognition application using SPICE circuit simulation tool. The results
obtained exhibit that the proposed SOT-MRAM based MLP can achieve accuracies
comparable to an ideal binarized MLP architecture implemented on GPU, while
realizing orders of magnitude increase in processing speed.

1947,"Hardware Security in Spin-Based Computing-In-Memory: Analysis, Exploits,
  and Mitigation Techniques","  Computing-in-memory (CIM) is proposed to alleviate the processor-memory data
transfer bottleneck in traditional Von-Neumann architectures, and
spintronics-based magnetic memory has demonstrated many facilitation in
implementing CIM paradigm. Since hardware security has become one of the major
concerns in circuit designs, this paper, for the first time, investigates
spin-based computing-in-memory (SpinCIM) from a security perspective. We focus
on two fundamental questions: 1) how the new SpinCIM computing paradigm can be
exploited to enhance hardware security? 2) what security concerns has this new
SpinCIM computing paradigm incurred?
"
1948,"Light-in-the-loop: using a photonics co-processor for scalable training
  of neural networks","  As neural networks grow larger and more complex and data-hungry, training
costs are skyrocketing. Especially when lifelong learning is necessary, such as
in recommender systems or self-driving cars, this might soon become
unsustainable. In this study, we present the first optical co-processor able to
accelerate the training phase of digitally-implemented neural networks. We rely
on direct feedback alignment as an alternative to backpropagation, and perform
the error projection step optically. Leveraging the optical random projections
delivered by our co-processor, we demonstrate its use to train a neural network
for handwritten digits recognition.
"
1949,"SeqXFilter: A Memory-efficient Denoising Filter for Dynamic Vision
  Sensors","  Neuromorphic event-based dynamic vision sensors (DVS) have much faster
sampling rates and a higher dynamic range than frame-based imaging sensors.
However, they are sensitive to background activity (BA) events that are
unwanted. There are some filters for tackling this problem based on
spatio-temporal correlation. However, they are either memory-intensive or
computing-intensive. We propose \emph{SeqXFilter}, a spatio-temporal
correlation filter with only a past event window that has an O(1) space
complexity and has simple computations. We explore the spatial correlation of
an event with its past few events by analyzing the distribution of the events
when applying different functions on the spatial distances. We find the best
function to check the spatio-temporal correlation for an event for
\emph{SeqXFilter}, best separating real events and noise events. We not only
give the visual denoising effect of the filter but also use two metrics for
quantitatively analyzing the filter's performance. Four neuromorphic
event-based datasets, recorded from four DVS with different output sizes, are
used for validation of our method. The experimental results show that
\emph{SeqXFilter} achieves similar performance as baseline NNb filters, but
with extremely small memory cost and simple computation logic.
"
1950,Implementing a Quantum Coin Scheme,"  Quantum computing has the power to break current cryptographic systems,
disrupting online banking, shopping, data storage and communications. Quantum
computing also has the power to support stronger more resistant technologies.
In this paper, we describe a digital cash scheme created by Dmitry Gavinsky,
which utilises the capability of quantum computing. We contribute by setting
out the methods for implementing this scheme. For both the creation and
verification of quantum coins we convert the algebraic steps into computing
steps. As part of this, we describe the methods used to convert information
stored on classical bits to information stored on quantum bits.
"
1951,"Neural Network for Low-Memory IoT Devices and MNIST Image Recognition
  Using Kernels Based on Logistic Map","  This study presents a neural network which uses filters based on logistic
mapping (LogNNet). LogNNet has a feedforward network structure, but possesses
the properties of reservoir neural networks. The input weight matrix, set by a
recurrent logistic mapping, forms the kernels that transform the input space to
the higher-dimensional feature space. The most effective recognition of a
handwritten digit from MNIST-10 occurs under chaotic behavior of the logistic
map. The correlation of classification accuracy with the value of the Lyapunov
exponent was obtained. An advantage of LogNNet implementation on IoT devices is
the significant savings in memory used. At the same time, LogNNet has a simple
algorithm and performance indicators comparable to those of the best
resource-efficient algorithms available at the moment. The presented network
architecture uses an array of weights with a total memory size from 1 to 29 kB
and achieves a classification accuracy of 80.3-96.3%. Memory is saved due to
the processor, which sequentially calculates the required weight coefficients
during the network operation using the analytical equation of the logistic
mapping. The proposed neural network can be used in implementations of
artificial intelligence based on constrained devices with limited memory, which
are integral blocks for creating ambient intelligence in modern IoT
environments. From a research perspective, LogNNet can contribute to the
understanding of the fundamental issues of the influence of chaos on the
behavior of reservoir-type neural networks.

1952,"An Inference and Learning Engine for Spiking Neural Networks in
  Computational RAM (CRAM)","  Spiking Neural Networks (SNN) represent a biologically inspired computation
model capable of emulating neural computation in human brain and brain-like
structures. The main promise is very low energy consumption. Unfortunately,
classic Von Neumann architecture based SNN accelerators often fail to address
demanding computation and data transfer requirements efficiently at scale. In
this work, we propose a promising alternative, an in-memory SNN accelerator
based on Spintronic Computational RAM (CRAM) to overcome scalability
limitations, which can reduce the energy consumption by up to 164.1$\times$
when compared to a representative ASIC solution.
"
1953,"Counting Cards: Exploiting Weight and Variance Distributions for Robust
  Compute In-Memory","  Compute in-memory (CIM) is a promising technique that minimizes data
transport, the primary performance bottleneck and energy cost of most data
intensive applications. This has found wide-spread adoption in accelerating
neural networks for machine learning applications. Utilizing a crossbar
architecture with emerging non-volatile memories (eNVM) such as dense resistive
random access memory (RRAM) or phase change random access memory (PCRAM),
various forms of neural networks can be implemented to greatly reduce power and
increase on chip memory capacity. However, compute in-memory faces its own
limitations at both the circuit and the device levels. In this work, we explore
the impact of device variation and peripheral circuit design constraints.
Furthermore, we propose a new algorithm based on device variance and neural
network weight distributions to increase both performance and accuracy for
compute-in memory based designs. We demonstrate a 27% power improvement and 23%
performance improvement for low and high variance eNVM, while satisfying a
programmable threshold for a target error tolerance, which depends on the
application.
"
1954,"HIPE-MAGIC: A Technology-Aware Synthesis and Mapping Flow for HIghly
  Parallel Execution of Memristor-Aided LoGIC","  Recent efforts for finding novel computing paradigms that meet today's design
requirements have given rise to a new trend of processing-in-memory relying on
non-volatile memories. In this paper, we present HIPE-MAGIC, a technology-aware
synthesis and mapping flow for highly parallel execution of the memristor-based
logic. Our framework is built upon two fundamental contributions: balancing
techniques during the logic synthesis, mainly targeting benefits of the
parallelism offered by memristive crossbar arrays (MCAs), and an efficient
technology mapping framework to maximize the performance and area-efficiency of
the memristor-based logic. Our experimental evaluations across several
benchmark suites demonstrate the superior performance of HIPE-MAGIC in terms of
throughput and energy efficiency compared to recently developed synthesis and
mapping flows targeting MCAs, as well as the conventional CPU computing.
"
1955,"6RLR-ABC: 6LoWPAN Routing Protocol With Local Repair Using Bio Inspired
  Artificial Bee Colony","  In recent years, Micro-Electro-Mechanical System (MEMS) has successfully
enabled the development of IPv6 over Low power Wireless Personal Area Network
(6LoWPAN). This network is equipped with low-cost, low-power, lightweight and
varied functions devices. These devices are capable of amassing, storing,
processing environmental information and conversing with neighbouring sensors.
These requisites pose a new and interesting challenge for the development of
IEEE 802.15.4 together with routing protocol. In this work, 6LoWPAN Routing
Protocol with Local Repair Using Bio Inspired Artificial Bee Colony (6RLR-ABC)
has been introduced. This protocol supports connection establishment between
nodes in an energy-efficient manner while maintaining high packet delivery
ratio and throughput and minimizing average end-to-end delay. This protocol has
been evaluated based on increasing generated traffic. The performance of the
designed 6RLR-ABC routing protocol has been evaluated compared to 6LoWPAN
Ad-hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (LOAD) routing protocol. LOAD protocol has
been chosen since it is the most relevant existed 6LoWPANrouting protocol. The
simulation results show that the introduced 6RLR-ABC protocol achieves lower
packet average end-to-end delay and lower energy consumption compared to LOAD
protocol.Additionally,the packet delivery ratio of the designed protocol is
much higher than LOAD protocol. The proposed 6RLR-ABC achieved about 39% higher
packet delivery ratio and about 54.8% higher throughput while simultaneously
offering lower average end-to-end delay and lower average energy consumption
than LOAD protocol.
"
1956,"Lowering the T-depth of Quantum Circuits By Reducing the Multiplicative
  Depth Of Logic Networks","  The multiplicative depth of a logic network over the gate basis $\{\land,
\oplus, \neg\}$ is the largest number of $\land$ gates on any path from a
primary input to a primary output in the network. We describe a dynamic
programming based logic synthesis algorithm to reduce the multiplicative depth
in logic networks. It makes use of cut enumeration, tree balancing, and
exclusive sum-of-products (ESOP) representations. Our algorithm has
applications to cryptography and quantum computing, as a reduction in the
multiplicative depth directly translates to a lower $T$-depth of the
corresponding quantum circuit. Our experimental results show improvements in
$T$-depth over state-of-the-art methods and over several hand-optimized quantum
circuits for instances of AES, SHA, and floating-point arithmetic.
"
1957,"Evaluation of Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm based on the
  approximation ratio of single samples","  The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a hybrid
quantum-classical algorithm to solve binary-variable optimization problems. Due
to its expected robustness to systematic errors and the short circuit depth, it
is one of the promising candidates likely to run on near-term quantum devices.
We project the performance of QAOA applied to the Max-Cut problem and compare
it with some of the best classical alternatives, both for exact or approximate
solution. When comparing approximate solvers, their performance is
characterized by the computational time taken to achieve a given quality of
solution. Since QAOA is based on sampling, we introduce performance metrics
based on the probability of observing a sample above a certain quality. In
addition, we show that the QAOA performance varies significantly with the graph
type. By selecting a suitable optimizer for the variational parameters and
reducing the number of function evaluations, QAOA performance improves by up to
2 orders of magnitude compared to previous estimates. Especially for 3-regular
random graphs, this setting decreases the performance gap with classical
alternatives.
"
1958,"Methodology for Realizing VMM with Binary RRAM Arrays: Experimental
  Demonstration of Binarized-ADALINE Using OxRAM Crossbar","  In this paper, we present an efficient hardware mapping methodology for
realizing vector matrix multiplication (VMM) on resistive memory (RRAM) arrays.
Using the proposed VMM computation technique, we experimentally demonstrate a
binarized-ADALINE (Adaptive Linear) classifier on an OxRAM crossbar. An 8x8
OxRAM crossbar with Ni/3-nm HfO2/7 nm Al-doped-TiO2/TiN device stack is used.
Weight training for the binarized-ADALINE classifier is performed ex-situ on
UCI cancer dataset. Post weight generation the OxRAM array is carefully
programmed to binary weight-states using the proposed weight mapping technique
on a custom-built testbench. Our VMM powered binarized-ADALINE network achieves
a classification accuracy of 78% in simulation and 67% in experiments.
Experimental accuracy was found to drop mainly due to crossbar inherent
sneak-path issues and RRAM device programming variability.

1959,"Unified Characterization Platform for Emerging NVM Technology: Neural
  Network Application Benchmarking Using off-the-shelf NVM Chips","  In this paper, we present a unified FPGA based electrical test-bench for
characterizing different emerging NonVolatile Memory (NVM) chips. In
particular, we present detailed electrical characterization and benchmarking of
multiple commercially available, off-the-shelf, NVM chips viz.: MRAM, FeRAM,
CBRAM, and ReRAM. We investigate important NVM parameters such as: (i) current
consumption patterns, (ii) endurance, and (iii) error characterization. The
proposed FPGA based testbench is then utilized for a Proof-of-Concept (PoC)
Neural Network (NN) image classification application. Four emerging NVM chips
are benchmarked against standard SRAM and Flash technology for the AI
application as active weight memory during inference mode.
"
1960,"Improving Dependability of Neuromorphic Computing With Non-Volatile
  Memory","  As process technology continues to scale aggressively, circuit aging in a
neuromorphic hardware due to negative bias temperature instability (NBTI) and
time-dependent dielectric breakdown (TDDB) is becoming a critical reliability
issue and is expected to proliferate when using non-volatile memory (NVM) for
synaptic storage. This is because an NVM requires high voltage and current to
access its synaptic weight, which further accelerates the circuit aging in a
neuromorphic hardware. Current methods for qualifying reliability are overly
conservative, since they estimate circuit aging considering worst-case
operating conditions and unnecessarily constrain performance. This paper
proposes RENEU, a reliability-oriented approach to map machine learning
applications to neuromorphic hardware, with the aim of improving system-wide
reliability without compromising key performance metrics such as execution time
of these applications on the hardware. Fundamental to RENEU is a novel
formulation of the aging of CMOS-based circuits in a neuromorphic hardware
considering different failure mechanisms. Using this formulation, RENEU
develops a system-wide reliability model which can be used inside a
design-space exploration framework involving the mapping of neurons and
synapses to the hardware. To this end, RENEU uses an instance of Particle Swarm
Optimization (PSO) to generate mappings that are Pareto-optimal in terms of
performance and reliability. We evaluate RENEU using different machine learning
applications on a state-of-the-art neuromorphic hardware with NVM synapses. Our
results demonstrate an average 38\% reduction in circuit aging, leading to an
average 18% improvement in the lifetime of the hardware compared to current
practices. RENEU only introduces a marginal performance overhead of 5% compared
to a performance-oriented state-of-the-art.
"
1961,"Loss-of-entanglement prediction of a controlled-PHASE gate in the
  framework of steepest-entropy-ascent quantum thermodynamics","  As has been shown elsewhere, a reasonable model of the loss of entanglement
or correlation that occurs in quantum computations is one which assumes that
they can effectively be predicted by a framework that presupposes the presence
of irreversibilities internal to the system. It is based on the
steepest-entropy-ascent principle and is used here to reproduce the behavior of
a controlled-PHASE gate in good agreement with experimental data. The results
show that the loss of entanglement predicted is related to the
irreversibilities in a nontrivial way, providing a possible alternative
approach that warrants exploration to that conventionally used to predict the
loss of entanglement. The results provide a means for understanding this loss
in quantum protocols from a nonequilibrium thermodynamic standpoint. This
framework permits the development of strategies for extending either the
maximum fidelity of the computation or the entanglement time.
"
1962,"Intelligent Surfaces for 6G Wireless Networks: A Survey of Optimization
  and Performance Analysis Techniques","  This paper surveys the optimization frameworks and performance analysis
methods for large intelligent surfaces (LIS), which have been emerging as
strong candidates to support the sixth-generation wireless physical platforms
(6G). Due to their ability to adjust the behavior of interacting
electromagnetic (EM) waves through intelligent manipulations of the reflections
phase shifts, LIS have shown promising merits at improving the spectral
efficiency of wireless networks. In this context, researchers have been
recently exploring LIS technology in depth as a means to achieve programmable,
virtualized, and distributed wireless network infrastructures. From a system
level perspective, LIS have also been proven to be a low-cost, green,
sustainable, and energy-efficient solution for 6G systems. This paper provides
a unique blend that surveys the principles of operation of LIS, together with
their optimization and performance analysis frameworks. The paper first
introduces the LIS technology and its physical working principle. Then, it
presents various optimization frameworks that aim to optimize specific
objectives, namely, maximizing energy efficiency, sum-rate, secrecy-rate, and
coverage. The paper afterwards discusses various relevant performance analysis
works including capacity analysis, the impact of hardware impairments on
capacity, uplink/downlink data rate analysis, and outage probability. The paper
further presents the impact of adopting the LIS technology for positioning
applications. Finally, we identify numerous exciting open challenges for
LIS-aided 6G wireless networks, including resource allocation problems, hybrid
radio frequency/visible light communication (RF-VLC) systems, health
considerations, and localization.
"
1963,Run-time Mapping of Spiking Neural Networks to Neuromorphic Hardware,"  In this paper, we propose a design methodology to partition and map the
neurons and synapses of online learning SNN-based applications to neuromorphic
architectures at {run-time}. Our design methodology operates in two steps --
step 1 is a layer-wise greedy approach to partition SNNs into clusters of
neurons and synapses incorporating the constraints of the neuromorphic
architecture, and step 2 is a hill-climbing optimization algorithm that
minimizes the total spikes communicated between clusters, improving energy
consumption on the shared interconnect of the architecture. We conduct
experiments to evaluate the feasibility of our algorithm using synthetic and
realistic SNN-based applications. We demonstrate that our algorithm reduces SNN
mapping time by an average 780x compared to a state-of-the-art design-time
based SNN partitioning approach with only 6.25\% lower solution quality.
"
1964,"Training spiking multi-layer networks with surrogate gradients on an
  analog neuromorphic substrate","  Spiking neural networks are nature's solution for parallel information
processing with high temporal precision at a low metabolic energy cost. To that
end, biological neurons integrate inputs as an analog sum and communicate their
outputs digitally as spikes, i.e., sparse binary events in time. These
architectural principles can be mirrored effectively in analog neuromorphic
hardware. Nevertheless, training spiking neural networks with sparse activity
on hardware devices remains a major challenge. Primarily this is due to the
lack of suitable training methods that take into account device-specific
imperfections and operate at the level of individual spikes instead of firing
rates. To tackle this issue, we developed a hardware-in-the-loop strategy to
train multi-layer spiking networks using surrogate gradients on the analog
BrainScales-2 chip. Specifically, we used the hardware to compute the forward
pass of the network, while the backward pass was computed in software. We
evaluated our approach on downscaled 16x16 versions of the MNIST and the
fashion MNIST datasets in which spike latencies encoded pixel intensities. The
analog neuromorphic substrate closely matched the performance of equivalently
sized networks implemented in software. It is capable of processing 70 k
patterns per second with a power consumption of less than 300 mW. Added
activity regularization resulted in sparse network activity with about 20
spikes per input, at little to no reduction in classification performance.
Thus, overall, our work demonstrates low-energy spiking network processing on
an analog neuromorphic substrate and sets several new benchmarks for hardware
systems in terms of classification accuracy, processing speed, and efficiency.
Importantly, our work emphasizes the value of hardware-in-the-loop training and
paves the way toward energy-efficient information processing on non-von-Neumann
architectures.
"
1965,Continual General Chunking Problem and SyncMap,"  Humans possess an inherent ability to chunk sequences into their constituent
parts. In fact, this ability is thought to bootstrap language skills to the
learning of image patterns which might be a key to a more animal-like type of
intelligence. Here, we propose a continual generalization of the chunking
problem (an unsupervised problem), encompassing fixed and probabilistic chunks,
discovery of temporal and causal structures and their continual variations.
Additionally, we propose an algorithm called SyncMap that can learn and adapt
to changes in the problem by creating a dynamic map which preserves the
correlation between variables. Results of SyncMap suggest that the proposed
algorithm learn near optimal solutions, despite the presence of many types of
structures and their continual variation. When compared to Word2vec, PARSER and
MRIL, SyncMap surpasses or ties with the best algorithm on $77\%$ of the
scenarios while being the second best in the remaing $23\%$.

1966,"A Design Methodology for Post-Moore's Law Accelerators: The Case of a
  Photonic Neuromorphic Processor","  Over the past decade alternative technologies have gained momentum as
conventional digital electronics continue to approach their limitations, due to
the end of Moore's Law and Dennard Scaling. At the same time, we are facing new
application challenges such as those due to the enormous increase in data. The
attention, has therefore, shifted from homogeneous computing to specialized
heterogeneous solutions. As an example, brain-inspired computing has re-emerged
as a viable solution for many applications. Such new processors, however, have
widened the abstraction gamut from device level to applications. Therefore,
efficient abstractions that can provide vertical design-flow tools for such
technologies became critical. Photonics in general, and neuromorphic photonics
in particular, are among the promising alternatives to electronics. While the
arsenal of device level toolbox for photonics, and high-level neural network
platforms are rapidly expanding, there has not been much work to bridge this
gap. Here, we present a design methodology to mitigate this problem by
extending high-level hardware-agnostic neural network design tools with
functional and performance models of photonic components. In this paper we
detail this tool and methodology by using design examples and associated
results. We show that adopting this approach enables designers to efficiently
navigate the design space and devise hardware-aware systems with alternative
technologies.
"
1967,"Quantum simulation and circuit design for solving multidimensional
  Poisson equations","  Many methods solve Poisson equations by using grid techniques which
discretize the problem in each dimension. Most of these algorithms are subject
to the curse of dimensionality, so that they need exponential runtime. In the
paper ""Quantum algorithm and circuit design solving the Poisson equation"" a
quantum algorithm is shown running in polylog time to produce a quantum state
representing the solution of the Poisson equation. In this paper a quantum
simulation of an extended circuit design based on this algorithm is made on a
classical computer. Our purpose is to test an efficient circuit design which
can break the curse of dimensionality on a quantum computer. Due to the
exponential rise of the Hilbert space this design is optimized on a small
number of qubits. We use Microsoft's Quantum Development Kit and its simulator
of an ideal quantum computer to validate the correctness of this algorithm.

1968,"Colour-Specific Microfluidic Droplet Detection for Molecular
  Communication","  Droplet-based microfluidic systems are a promising platform forlab-on-a-chip
(LoC) applications. These systems can also be used toenhance LoC applications
with integrated droplet control information or for data transmission scenarios
in the context of molecular communication. For both use-cases the detection and
characterisation of droplets in small microfluidic channels is crucial. So far,
only complex lab setups with restricted capabilities have been presented as
detection devices. We present a new low-cost and portable droplet detector. The
device is used to confidently distinguish between individual droplets in a
droplet-based microfluidic system. Using on-off keying a 16-bit sequence is
successfully transmittedfor the first time with such a setup. Furthermore, the
devices capabilities to characterise droplets regarding colour and size are
demonstrated. Such an application of a spectral sensor in a microfluidic system
presents new possibilities, such as colour-coded data transmission or analysis
of droplet content.

1969,"In-Memory Resistive RAM Implementation of Binarized Neural Networks for
  Medical Applications","  The advent of deep learning has considerably accelerated machine learning
development. The deployment of deep neural networks at the edge is however
limited by their high memory and energy consumption requirements. With new
memory technology available, emerging Binarized Neural Networks (BNNs) are
promising to reduce the energy impact of the forthcoming machine learning
hardware generation, enabling machine learning on the edge devices and avoiding
data transfer over the network. In this work, after presenting our
implementation employing a hybrid CMOS - hafnium oxide resistive memory
technology, we suggest strategies to apply BNNs to biomedical signals such as
electrocardiography and electroencephalography, keeping accuracy level and
reducing memory requirements. We investigate the memory-accuracy trade-off when
binarizing whole network and binarizing solely the classifier part. We also
discuss how these results translate to the edge-oriented Mobilenet~V1 neural
network on the Imagenet task. The final goal of this research is to enable
smart autonomous healthcare devices.
"
1970,"End-to-End Memristive HTM System for Pattern Recognition and Sequence
  Prediction","  Neuromorphic systems that learn and predict from streaming inputs hold
significant promise in pervasive edge computing and its applications. In this
paper, a neuromorphic system that processes spatio-temporal information on the
edge is proposed. Algorithmically, the system is based on hierarchical temporal
memory that inherently offers online learning, resiliency, and fault tolerance.
Architecturally, it is a full custom mixed-signal design with an underlying
digital communication scheme and analog computational modules. Therefore, the
proposed system features reconfigurability, real-time processing, low power
consumption, and low-latency processing. The proposed architecture is
benchmarked to predict on real-world streaming data. The network's mean
absolute percentage error on the mixed-signal system is 1.129X lower compared
to its baseline algorithm model. This reduction can be attributed to device
non-idealities and probabilistic formation of synaptic connections. We
demonstrate that the combined effect of Hebbian learning and network sparsity
also plays a major role in extending the overall network lifespan. We also
illustrate that the system offers 3.46X reduction in latency and 77.02X
reduction in power consumption when compared to a custom CMOS digital design
implemented at the same technology node. By employing specific low power
techniques, such as clock gating, we observe 161.37X reduction in power
consumption.
"
1971,"Optimizing Placement of Heap Memory Objects in Energy-Constrained Hybrid
  Memory Systems","  Main memory (DRAM) significantly impacts the power and energy utilization of
the overall server system. Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) devices, such as Phase
Change Memory and Spin-Transfer Torque RAM, are suitable candidates for main
memory to reduce energy consumption. But unlike DRAM, NVMs access latencies are
higher than DRAM and NVM writes are more energy sensitive than DRAM write
operations. Thus, Hybrid Main Memory Systems (HMMS) employing DRAM and NVM have
been proposed to reduce the overall energy depletion of main memory while
optimizing the performance of NVM. This paper proposes eMap, an optimal heap
memory object placement planner in HMMS. eMap considers the object-level access
patterns and energy consumption at the application level and provides an ideal
placement strategy for each object to augment performance and energy
utilization. eMap is equipped with two modules, eMPlan and eMDyn. Specifically,
eMPlan is a static placement planner which provides one time placement policies
for memory object to meet the energy budget while eMDyn is a runtime placement
planner to consider the change in energy limiting constraint during the runtime
and shuffles the memory objects by taking into account the access patterns as
well as the migration cost in terms of energy and performance. The evaluation
shows that our proposed solution satisfies both the energy limiting constraint
and the performance. We compare our methodology with the state-of-the-art
memory object classification and allocation (MOCA) framework. Our extensive
evaluation shows that our proposed solution, eMPlan meets the energy constraint
with 4.17 times less costly and reducing the energy consumption up to 14% with
the same performance. eMDyn also satisfies the performance and energy
requirement while considering the migration cost in terms of time and energy.

1972,"Quantum Computer: Hello, Music!","  Quantum computing is emerging as a promising technology, which is built on
the principles of subatomic physics. By the time of writing, fully fledged
practical quantum computers are not widely available. But research and
development are advancing rapidly. Various software simulators are already
available. And a few companies have already started to provide access to
quantum hardware via the cloud. These initiatives have enabled experiments with
quantum computing to tackle some realistic problems in science; e.g., in
chemistry and cryptography. In spite of continuing progress in developing
increasingly more sophisticated hardware and software, research in quantum
computing has been focusing primarily on developing scientific applications. Up
till now there has been virtually no research activity aimed at widening the
range of applications of this technology beyond science and engineering. In
particular applications for the entertainment industry and creative economies.
This article introduces a new field of research, which is referred to as
Quantum Computer Music. This research is aimed at the development of quantum
computing tools and approaches to creating, performing, listening to and
distributing music. The article begins with a brief historical background.
Then, it introduces the notion of algorithmic music and presents two quantum
computer music systems: a singing voice synthesiser and a musical sequencer
based on quantum walk. A primer on quantum computing is also given. The chapter
ends with a concluding discussion and advice for further work to develop this
new exciting area of research.

1973,Freely scalable and reconfigurable optical hardware for deep learning,"  As deep neural network (DNN) models grow ever-larger, they can achieve higher
accuracy and solve more complex problems. This trend has been enabled by an
increase in available compute power; however, efforts to continue to scale
electronic processors are impeded by the costs of communication, thermal
management, power delivery and clocking. To improve scalability, we propose a
digital optical neural network (DONN) with intralayer optical interconnects and
reconfigurable input values. The near path-length-independence of optical
energy consumption enables information locality between a transmitter and
arbitrarily arranged receivers, which allows greater flexibility in
architecture design to circumvent scaling limitations. In a proof-of-concept
experiment, we demonstrate optical multicast in the classification of 500 MNIST
images with a 3-layer, fully-connected network. We also analyze the energy
consumption of the DONN and find that optical data transfer is beneficial over
electronics when the spacing of computational units is on the order of >10
micrometers.

1974,"Developing of a photonic hardware platform for brain-inspired computing
  based on $5\times5$ VCSEL arrays","  Brain-inspired computing concepts like artificial neural networks have become
promising alternatives to classical von Neumann computer architectures.
Photonic neural networks target the realizations of neurons, network
connections and potentially learning in photonic substrates. Here, we report
the development of a nanophotonic hardware platform of fast and
energy-efficient photonic neurons via arrays of high-quality vertical cavity
surface emitting lasers (VCSELs). The developed $5\times5$ VCSEL arrays provide
high optical injection locking efficiency through homogeneous fabrication
combined with individual control over the laser wavelengths. Injection locking
is crucial for the reliable processing of information in VCSEL-based photonic
neurons, and we demonstrate the suitability of the VCSEL arrays by injection
locking measurements and current-induced spectral fine-tuning. We find that our
investigated array can readily be tuned to the required spectral homogeneity,
and as such show that VCSEL arrays based on our technology can act as highly
energy efficient and ultra-fast photonic neurons for next generation photonic
neural networks. Combined with fully parallel photonic networks our substrates
are promising for ultra-fast operation reaching 10s of GHz bandwidths, and we
show that a nonlinear transformation based on our lasers will consume only
about 100 fJ per VCSEL, which is highly competitive, compared to other
platforms.

1975,Quantum Shuttle: Traffic Navigation with Quantum Computing,"  The Web Summit conference in Lisbon, Portugal, is one of the biggest
technology conferences in Europe, attended by tens of thousands of people every
year. The high influx of people into Lisbon causes significant stress on the
city's transit services for the duration of the conference. For the Web Summit
2019, Volkswagen AG partnered with the city of Lisbon for a pilot project to
provide quantum computing-based traffic optimization. A two-phase solution was
implemented: the first phase used data science techniques to analyze the
movement of people from previous conferences to build temporary new bus routes
throughout the city. The second phase used a custom Android navigation app
installed in the buses operated by Carris, powered by a quantum optimization
service provided by Volkswagen that connected to live traffic data and a D-Wave
quantum processing unit to optimize the buses' routes in real-time. To our
knowledge, this is the first commercial application that depends on a quantum
processor to perform a critical live task.
"
1976,"Ultra-Low-Power FDSOI Neural Circuits for Extreme-Edge Neuromorphic
  Intelligence","  Recent years have seen an increasing interest in the development of
artificial intelligence circuits and systems for edge computing applications.
In-memory computing mixed-signal neuromorphic architectures provide promising
ultra-low-power solutions for edge-computing sensory-processing applications,
thanks to their ability to emulate spiking neural networks in real-time. The
fine-grain parallelism offered by this approach allows such neural circuits to
process the sensory data efficiently by adapting their dynamics to the ones of
the sensed signals, without having to resort to the time-multiplexed computing
paradigm of von Neumann architectures. To reduce power consumption even
further, we present a set of mixed-signal analog/digital circuits that exploit
the features of advanced Fully-Depleted Silicon on Insulator (FDSOI)
integration processes. Specifically, we explore the options of advanced FDSOI
technologies to address analog design issues and optimize the design of the
synapse integrator and of the adaptive neuron circuits accordingly. We present
circuit simulation results and demonstrate the circuit's ability to produce
biologically plausible neural dynamics with compact designs, optimized for the
realization of large-scale spiking neural networks in neuromorphic processors.
"
1977,Quantum Approximate Optimization for Hard Problems in Linear Algebra,"  The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) by Farhi et al. is a
framework for hybrid quantum/classical optimization. In this paper, we explore
using QAOA for binary linear least squares; a problem that can serve as a
building block of several other hard problems in linear algebra. Most of the
previous efforts in quantum computing for solving these problems were done
using the quantum annealing paradigm. For the scope of this work, our
experiments were done on the QISKIT simulator and an IBM Q 5 qubit machine. We
highlight the possibilities of using QAOA and QAOA-like variational algorithms
for solving such problems, where the result outputs produced are classical. We
find promising numerical results, and point out some of the challenges involved
in current-day experimental implementations of this technique on a cloud-based
quantum computer.
"
1978,"Graphene-based Nanoscale Molecular Communication Receiver: Fabrication
  and Microfluidic Analysis","  Bio-inspired molecular communications (MC), where molecules are used to
transfer information, is the most promising technique to realise the Internet
of Nano Things (IoNT), thanks to its inherent biocompatibility,
energy-efficiency, and reliability in physiologically-relevant environments.
Despite a substantial body of theoretical work concerning MC, the lack of
practical micro/nanoscale MC devices and MC testbeds has led researchers to
make overly simplifying assumptions about the implications of the channel
conditions and the physical architectures of the practical transceivers in
developing theoretical models and devising communication methods for MC. On the
other hand, MC imposes unique challenges resulting from the highly complex,
nonlinear, time-varying channel properties that cannot be always tackled by
conventional information and communication tools and technologies (ICT). As a
result, the reliability of the existing MC methods, which are mostly adopted
from electromagnetic communications and not validated with practical testbeds,
is highly questionable. As the first step to remove this discrepancy, in this
study, we report on the fabrication of a nanoscale MC receiver based on
graphene field-effect transistor biosensors. We perform its ICT
characterisation in a custom-designed microfluidic MC system with the
information encoded into the concentration of single-stranded DNA molecules.
This experimental platform is the first practical implementation of a
micro/nanoscale MC system with nanoscale MC receivers, and can serve as a
testbed for developing realistic MC methods and IoNT applications.
"
1979,"Mutual Information in Coupled Double Quantum Dots: A Simple Analytic
  Model for Potential Artificial Consciousness","  The integrated information theory is thought to be a key clue towards the
theoretical understanding of consciousness. In this study, we propose a simple
numerical model comprising a set of coupled double quantum dots, where the
disconnection of the elements is represented by the removal of Coulomb
interaction between the quantum dots, for the quantitative investigation of
integrated information. As a measure of integrated information, we calculate
the mutual information in the model system, as the Kullback-Leibler divergence
between the connected and disconnected status, through the probability
distribution of the electronic states from the master transition-rate
equations. We reasonably demonstrate that the increase in the strength of
interaction between the quantum dots leads to higher mutual information, owing
to the larger divergence in the probability distributions of the electronic
states. Our model setup could be a useful basic tool for numerical analyses in
the field of integrated information theory.
"
1980,A Compact Gated-Synapse Model for Neuromorphic Circuits,"  This work reports a compact behavioral model for gated-synaptic memory. The
model is developed in Verilog-A for easy integration into computer-aided design
of neuromorphic circuits using emerging memory. The model encompasses various
forms of gated synapses within a single framework and is not restricted to only
a single type. The behavioral theory of the model is described in detail along
with a full list of the default parameter settings. The model includes
parameters such as a device's ideal set time, threshold voltage, general
evolution of the conductance with respect to time, decay of the device's state,
etc. Finally, the model's validity is shown via extensive simulation and
fitting to experimentally reported data on published gated-synapses.
"
1981,"Towards analyzing large graphs with quantum annealing and quantum gate
  computers","  The use of quantum computing in graph community detection and regularity
checking related to Szemeredi's Regularity Lemma (SRL) are demonstrated with
D-Wave Systems' quantum annealer and simulations. We demonstrate the capability
of quantum computing in solving hard problems relevant to big data. A new
community detection algorithm based on SRL is also introduced and tested. In
worst case scenario of regularity check we use Grover's algorithm and quantum
phase estimation algorithm, in order to speed-up computations using a quantum
gate computers.
"
1982,TDO-CIM: Transparent Detection and Offloading for Computation In-memory,"  Computation in-memory is a promising non-von Neumann approach aiming at
completely diminishing the data transfer to and from the memory subsystem.
Although a lot of architectures have been proposed, compiler support for such
architectures is still lagging behind. In this paper, we close this gap by
proposing an end-to-end compilation flow for in-memory computing based on the
LLVM compiler infrastructure. Starting from sequential code, our approach
automatically detects, optimizes, and offloads kernels suitable for in-memory
acceleration. We demonstrate our compiler tool-flow on the PolyBench/C
benchmark suite and evaluate the benefits of our proposed in-memory
architecture simulated in Gem5 by comparing it with a state-of-the-art von
Neumann architecture.
"
1983,"Emulation of Astrocyte Induced Neural Phase Synchrony in Spin-Orbit
  Torque Oscillator Neurons","  Astrocytes play a central role in inducing concerted phase synchronized
neural-wave patterns inside the brain. In this letter, we demonstrate that
injected radio-frequency signal in underlying heavy metal layer of spin-orbit
torque oscillator neurons mimic the neuron phase synchronization effect
realized by glial cells. Potential application of such phase coupling effects
is illustrated in the context of a temporal ""binding problem"". We also present
the design of a coupled neuron-synapse-astrocyte network enabled by compact
neuromimetic devices by combining the concepts of local spike-timing dependent
plasticity and astrocyte induced neural phase synchrony.
"
1984,Threshold Logic with Current-Driven Magnetic Domain Walls,"  The recent demonstration of current-driven magnetic domain wall logic [Z. Luo
et al., Nature 579:214] was based on a three-input logic gate that was
identified as a reconfigurable NAND/NOR function. We reinterpret this logic
gate as a minority gate within the context of threshold logic, enabling a
domain wall threshold logic paradigm in which the device count can be reduced
by 80%. Furthermore, by extending the logic gate to more than three inputs of
non-equal weight, an 87% reduction in device count can be achieved.
"
1985,Realizing Quantum Algorithms on Real Quantum Computing Devices,"  Quantum computing is currently moving from an academic idea to a practical
reality. Quantum computing in the cloud is already available and allows users
from all over the world to develop and execute real quantum algorithms.
However, companies which are heavily investing in this new technology such as
Google, IBM, Rigetti, Intel, IonQ, and Xanadu follow diverse technological
approaches. This led to a situation where we have substantially different
quantum computing devices available thus far. They mostly differ in the number
and kind of qubits and the connectivity between them. Because of that, various
methods for realizing the intended quantum functionality on a given quantum
computing device are available. This paper provides an introduction and
overview into this domain and describes corresponding methods, also referred to
as compilers, mappers, synthesizers, transpilers, or routers.
"
1986,"Transfer Function Models for Cylindrical MC Channels with Diffusion and
  Laminar Flow","  The analysis and design of advection-diffusion based molecular communication
(MC) systems in cylindrical environments is of particular interest for
applications such as micro-fluidics and targeted drug delivery in blood
vessels. Therefore, the accurate modeling of the corresponding MC channel is of
high importance. The propagation of particles in these systems is caused by a
combination of diffusion and flow with a parabolic velocity profile, i.e.,
laminar flow. The propagation characteristics of the particles can be
categorized into three different regimes: The flow dominant regime where the
influence of diffusion on the particle transport is negligible, the dispersive
regime where diffusion has a much stronger impact than flow, and the mixed
regime where both effects are important. For the limiting regimes, i.e., the
flow dominant and dispersive regimes, there are well-known solutions and
approximations for particle transport. In contrast, there is no general
analytical solution for the mixed regime, and instead, approximations,
numerical techniques, and particle based simulations have been employed. In
this paper, we develop a general model for the advection-diffusion problem in
cylindrical environments which provides an analytical solution applicable in
all regimes. The modeling procedure is based on a transfer function approach
and the main focus lies on the incorporation of laminar flow into the
analytical model. The properties of the proposed model are analyzed by
numerical evaluation for different scenarios including the uniform and point
release of particles. We provide a comparison with particle based simulations
and the well-known solutions for the limiting regimes to demonstrate the
validity of the proposed analytical model.
"
1987,Novel Memory Structures in QCA Nano Technology,"  Quantum-dot Cellular Automata (QCA) is a new emerging technology for
designing electronic circuits in nanoscale. QCA technology comes to overcome
the CMOS limitation and to be a good alternative as it can work in
ultra-high-speed. QCA brought researchers attention due to many features such
as low power consumption, small feature size in addition to high frequency.
Designing circuits in QCA technology with minimum costs such as cells count and
the area is very important. This paper presents novel structures of D-latch and
D-Flip Flop with the lower area and cell count. The proposed Flip-Flop has SET
and RESET ability. The proposed latch and Flip-Flop have lower complexity
compared with counterparts in terms of cell counts by 32% and 26% respectively.
The proposed circuits are designed and simulated in QCADesigner software.
"
1988,Building Reservoir Computing Hardware Using Low Energy-Barrier Magnetics,"  Biologically inspired recurrent neural networks, such as reservoir computers
are of interest in designing spatio-temporal data processors from a hardware
point of view due to the simple learning scheme and deep connections to Kalman
filters. In this work we discuss using in-depth simulation studies a way to
construct hardware reservoir computers using an analog stochastic neuron cell
built from a low energy-barrier magnet based magnetic tunnel junction and a few
transistors. This allows us to implement a physical embodiment of the
mathematical model of reservoir computers. Compact implementation of reservoir
computers using such devices may enable building compact, energy-efficient
signal processors for standalone or in-situ machine cognition in edge devices.
"
1989,"A Secure Back-up and Restore for Resource-Constrained IoT based on
  Nanotechnology","  With the emergence of IoT (Internet of things), huge amounts of sensitive
data are being processed and transmitted everyday in edge devices with little
to no security. Due to their aggressive power management schemes, it is a
common and necessary technique to make a back-up of their program states and
other necessary data in a non-volatile memory (NVM) before going to sleep or
low power mode. However, this memory is often left unprotected as adding robust
security measures tends to be expensive for these resource constrained systems.
In this paper, we propose a lightweight security system for NVM during low
power mode. This security architecture uses the memristor, an emerging
nanoscale device which is used to build hardware security primitives like PUF
(physical unclonable function) based encryption-decryption, true random number
generators (TRNG), and memory integrity checking. A reliability enhancement
technique for this PUF is also proposed which shows how this system would work
even with less-than-100\% reliable PUF responses. Together, with all these
techniques, we have established a dual layer security protocol (data
encryption+integrity check) which provides reasonable security to an embedded
processor while being very lightweight in terms of area, power, and computation
time. A complete system design is demonstrated with 65$n$m CMOS and emerging
memristive technology. With this, we have provided a detailed and accurate
estimation of resource overhead. Analysis of the security of the whole system
is also provided.
"
1990,Analog Computing with Metatronic Circuits,"  Analog photonic solutions offer unique opportunities to address complex
computational tasks with unprecedented performance in terms of energy
dissipation and speeds, overcoming current limitations of modern computing
architectures based on electron flows and digital approaches. The lack of
modularization and lumped element reconfigurability in photonics has prevented
the transition to an all-optical analog computing platform. Here, we explore a
nanophotonic platform based on epsilon-near-zero materials capable of solving
in the analog domain partial differential equations (PDE). Wavelength
stretching in zero-index media enables highly nonlocal interactions within the
board based on the conduction of electric displacement, which can be monitored
to extract the solution of a broad class of PDE problems. By exploiting control
of deposition technique through process parameters, we demonstrate the
possibility of implementing the proposed nano-optic processor using
CMOS-compatible indium-tin-oxide, whose optical properties can be tuned by
carrier injection to obtain programmability at high speeds and low energy
requirements. Our nano-optical analog processor can be integrated at
chip-scale, processing arbitrary inputs at the speed of light.
"
1991,"Efficient ancilla-free reversible and quantum circuits for the Hidden
  Weighted Bit function","  The Hidden Weighted Bit function plays an important role in the study of
classical models of computation. A common belief is that this function is
exponentially hard for the implementation by reversible ancilla-free circuits,
even though introducing a small number of ancillae allows a very efficient
implementation. In this paper, we refute the exponential hardness conjecture by
developing a polynomial-size reversible ancilla-free circuit computing the
Hidden Weighted Bit function. Our circuit has size $O(n^{6.42})$, where $n$ is
the number of input bits. We also show that the Hidden Weighted Bit function
can be computed by a quantum ancilla-free circuit of size $O(n^2)$. The
technical tools employed come from a combination of Theoretical Computer
Science (Barrington's theorem) and Physics (simulation of fermionic
Hamiltonians) techniques.
"
1992,Reverse Annealing for Nonnegative/Binary Matrix Factorization,"  It was recently shown that quantum annealing can be used as an effective,
fast subroutine in certain types of matrix factorization algorithms. The
quantum annealing algorithm performed best for quick, approximate answers, but
performance rapidly plateaued. In this paper, we utilize reverse annealing
instead of forward annealing in the quantum annealing subroutine for
nonnegative/binary matrix factorization problems. After an initial global
search with forward annealing, reverse annealing performs a series of local
searches that refine existing solutions. The combination of forward and reverse
annealing significantly improves performance compared to forward annealing
alone for all but the shortest run times.
"
1993,Physics Successfully Implements Lagrange Multiplier Optimization,"  Optimization is a major part of human effort. While being mathematical,
optimization is also built into physics. For example, physics has the principle
of Least Action, the principle of Minimum Entropy Generation, and the
Variational Principle. Physics also has physical annealing which, of course,
preceded computational Simulated Annealing. Physics has the Adiabatic
Principle, which in its quantum form is called Quantum Annealing. Thus,
physical machines can solve the mathematical problem of optimization, including
constraints. Binary constraints can be built into the physical optimization. In
that case the machines are digital in the same sense that a flip-flop is
digital. A wide variety of machines have had recent success at optimizing the
Ising magnetic energy. We demonstrate in this paper that almost all those
machines perform optimization according to the Principle of Minimum Entropy
Generation as put forth by Onsager. Further, we show that this optimization is
in fact equivalent to Lagrange multiplier optimization for constrained
problems. We find that the physical gain coefficients which drive those systems
actually play the role of the corresponding Lagrange Multipliers.
"
1994,"Coarse scale representation of spiking neural networks: backpropagation
  through spikes and application to neuromorphic hardware","  In this work we explore recurrent representations of leaky integrate and fire
neurons operating at a timescale equal to their absolute refractory period. Our
coarse time scale approximation is obtained using a probability distribution
function for spike arrivals that is homogeneously distributed over this time
interval. This leads to a discrete representation that exhibits the same
dynamics as the continuous model, enabling efficient large scale simulations
and backpropagation through the recurrent implementation. We use this approach
to explore the training of deep spiking neural networks including
convolutional, all-to-all connectivity, and maxpool layers directly in Pytorch.
We found that the recurrent model leads to high classification accuracy using
just 4-long spike trains during training. We also observed a good transfer back
to continuous implementations of leaky integrate and fire neurons. Finally, we
applied this approach to some of the standard control problems as a first step
to explore reinforcement learning using neuromorphic chips.
"
1995,Embracing the Unreliability of Memory Devices for Neuromorphic Computing,"  The emergence of resistive non-volatile memories opens the way to highly
energy-efficient computation near- or in-memory. However, this type of
computation is not compatible with conventional ECC, and has to deal with
device unreliability. Inspired by the architecture of animal brains, we present
a manufactured differential hybrid CMOS/RRAM memory architecture suitable for
neural network implementation that functions without formal ECC. We also show
that using low-energy but error-prone programming conditions only slightly
reduces network accuracy.
"
1996,"Engineering Calcium Signaling of Astrocytes for Neural-Molecular
  Computing Logic Gates","  This paper proposes the use of Eukaryotic cells, namely astrocytes, to
develop logic gates. The logic gates are achieved by manipulating the threshold
of Ca$^{2+}$ ion flows between the cells, based on the input signals. Through
wet-lab experiments that engineer the astrocytes cells with pcDNA3.1-hGPR17
genes, we show that both AND and OR gates can be implemented by controlling
Ca$^{2+}$ signals that flow through the population. A reinforced learning
platform is also presented in the paper to optimize two main parameters, which
are the Ca$^{2+}$ activation threshold and time slot of input signals $T_b$
into the gate. This design platform caters for any size and connectivity of the
cell population, by taking into consideration the delay and noise produced from
the signalling between the cells, in order to fine-tune the activation
threshold and input signal time slot parameters. To validate the effectiveness
of the reinforced learning platform, a Ca$^{2+}$ Signalling-based Molecular
Communications Simulator was used to simulate the signalling between the
astrocyte cells. The results from the simulation showed that an optimum value
for both the Ca$^{2+}$ activation threshold and time slot of input signals
$T_b$ is required to achieve optimal computation accuracy, where up to 90\%
accuracy for both the AND and OR gates can be achieved with the right
combination of values. The reinforced learning platform for the engineered
astrocytes to create digital logic gates can be used for future
Neural-Molecular Computing chip, which can revolutionize brain implants that
are constructed from engineered biological cells.
"
1997,2D Qubit Placement of Quantum Circuits using LONGPATH,"  In order to achieve speedup over conventional classical computing for finding
solution of computationally hard problems, quantum computing was introduced.
Quantum algorithms can be simulated in a pseudo quantum environment, but
implementation involves realization of quantum circuits through physical
synthesis of quantum gates. This requires decomposition of complex quantum
gates into a cascade of simple one qubit and two qubit gates. The
methodological framework for physical synthesis imposes a constraint regarding
placement of operands (qubits) and operators. If physical qubits can be placed
on a grid, where each node of the grid represents a qubit then quantum gates
can only be operated on adjacent qubits, otherwise SWAP gates must be inserted
to convert non-Linear Nearest Neighbor architecture to Linear Nearest Neighbor
architecture. Insertion of SWAP gates should be made optimal to reduce
cumulative cost of physical implementation. A schedule layout generation is
required for placement and routing apriori to actual implementation. In this
paper, two algorithms are proposed to optimize the number of SWAP gates in any
arbitrary quantum circuit. The first algorithm is intended to start with
generation of an interaction graph followed by finding the longest path
starting from the node with maximum degree. The second algorithm optimizes the
number of SWAP gates between any pair of non-neighbouring qubits. Our proposed
approach has a significant reduction in number of SWAP gates in 1D and 2D NTC
architecture.

1998,"Securing the Insecure: A First-Line-of-Defense for Nanoscale
  Communication Systems Operating in THz Band","  Nanoscale communication systems operating in Ter-ahertz (THz) band are
anticipated to revolutionise the healthcaresystems of the future. Global
wireless data traffic is undergoinga rapid growth. However, wireless systems,
due to their broad-casting nature, are vulnerable to malicious security
breaches. Inaddition, advances in quantum computing poses a risk to
existingcrypto-based information security. It is of the utmost importanceto
make the THz systems resilient to potential active and passiveattacks which may
lead to devastating consequences, especiallywhen handling sensitive patient
data in healthcare systems. Newstrategies are needed to analyse these malicious
attacks and topropose viable countermeasures. In this manuscript, we presenta
new authentication mechanism for nanoscale communicationsystems operating in
THz band at the physical layer. We assessedan impersonation attack on a THz
system. We propose usingpath loss as a fingerprint to conduct authentication
via two-stephypothesis testing for a transmission device. We used hiddenMarkov
Model (HMM) viterbi algorithm to enhance the outputof hypothesis testing. We
also conducted transmitter identificationusing maximum likelihood and Gaussian
mixture model (GMM)expectation maximization algorithms. Our simulations
showedthat the error probabilities are a decreasing functions of SNR. At 10 dB
with 0.2 false alarm, the detection probability was almostone. We further
observed that HMM out-performs hypothesistesting at low SNR regime (10%
increase in accuracy is recordedat SNR =5 dB) whereas the GMM is useful when
groundtruths are noisy. Our work addresses major security gaps facedby
communication system either through malicious breachesor quantum computing,
enabling new applications of nanoscalesystems for Industry 4.0.
"
1999,"Radiation pattern prediction for Metasurfaces: A Neural Network based
  approach","  As the current standardization for the 5G networks nears completion, work
towards understanding the potential technologies for the 6G wireless networks
is already underway. One of these potential technologies for the 6G networks
are Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs). They offer unprecedented
degrees of freedom towards engineering the wireless channel, i.e., the ability
to modify the characteristics of the channel whenever and however required.
Nevertheless, such properties demand that the response of the associated
metasurface (MSF) is well understood under all possible operational conditions.
While an understanding of the radiation pattern characteristics can be obtained
through either analytical models or full wave simulations, they suffer from
inaccuracy under certain conditions and extremely high computational
complexity, respectively. Hence, in this paper we propose a novel neural
networks based approach that enables a fast and accurate characterization of
the MSF response. We analyze multiple scenarios and demonstrate the
capabilities and utility of the proposed methodology. Concretely, we show that
this method is able to learn and predict the parameters governing the reflected
wave radiation pattern with an accuracy of a full wave simulation (98.8%-99.8%)
and the time and computational complexity of an analytical model. The
aforementioned result and methodology will be of specific importance for the
design, fault tolerance and maintenance of the thousands of RISs that will be
deployed in the 6G network environment.

2000,SHE-MTJ Circuits for Convolutional Neural Networks,"  We report the performance characteristics of a notional Convolutional Neural
Network based on the previously-proposed Multiply-Accumulate-Activate-Pool set,
an MTJ-based spintronic circuit made to compute multiple neural functionalities
in parallel. A study of image classification with the MNIST handwritten digits
dataset using this network is provided via simulation. The effect of changing
the weight representation precision, the severity of device process variation
within the MAAP sets and the computational redundancy are provided. The
emulated network achieves between 90 and 95\% image classification accuracy at
a cost of ~100 nJ per image.
"
2001,"Spin-Hall MTJ Cells for Intra-Column Competition in Hierarchical
  Temporal Memory","  We propose a dedicated winner-take-all circuit to efficiently implement the
intra-column competition between cells in Hierarchical Temporal Memory which is
a crucial part of the algorithm. All inputs and outputs are charge-based for
compatibility with standard CMOS. The circuit incorporates memristors for
competitive advantage to emulate a column with a cell in a predictive state.
The circuit can also detect columns 'bursting' by passive averaging and
comparison of the cell outputs. The proposed spintronic devices and circuit are
thoroughly described and a series of simulations are used to predict the
performance. The simulations indicate that the circuit can complete a
nine-cell, nine-input competition operation in under 15 ns at a cost of about
25 pJ.
"
2002,"Bit-Slicing the Hilbert Space: Scaling Up Accurate Quantum Circuit
  Simulation to a New Level","  Quantum computing is greatly advanced in recent years and is expected to
transform the computation paradigm in the near future. Quantum circuit
simulation plays a key role in the toolchain for the development of quantum
hardware and software systems. However, due to the enormous Hilbert space of
quantum states, simulating quantum circuits with classical computers is
extremely challenging despite notable efforts have been made. In this paper, we
enhance quantum circuit simulation in two dimensions: accuracy and scalability.
The former is achieved by using an algebraic representation of complex numbers;
the latter is achieved by bit-slicing the number representation and replacing
matrix-vector multiplication with symbolic Boolean function manipulation.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method can be superior to the
state-of-the-art for various quantum circuits and can simulate certain
benchmark families with up to tens of thousands of qubits.
"
2003,"Energy Efficient Computing Systems: Architectures, Abstractions and
  Modeling to Techniques and Standards","  Computing systems have undergone several inflexion points - while Moore's law
guided the semiconductor industry to cram more and more transistors and logic
into the same volume, the limits of instruction-level parallelism (ILP) and the
end of Dennard's scaling drove the industry towards multi-core chips. We have
now entered the era of domain-specific architectures for new workloads like AI
and ML. These trends continue, arguably with other limits, along with
challenges imposed by tighter integration, extreme form factors and diverse
workloads, making systems more complex from an energy efficiency perspective.
Many research surveys have covered different aspects of techniques in hardware
and microarchitecture across devices, servers, HPC, data center systems along
with software, algorithms, frameworks for energy efficiency and thermal
management. Somewhat in parallel, the semiconductor industry has developed
techniques and standards around specification, modeling and verification of
complex chips; these areas have not been addressed in detail by previous
research surveys. This survey aims to bring these domains together and is
composed of a systematic categorization of key aspects of building energy
efficient systems - (a) specification - the ability to precisely specify the
power intent or properties at different layers (b) modeling and simulation of
the entire system or subsystem (hardware or software or both) so as to be able
to perform what-if analysis, (c) techniques used for implementing energy
efficiency at different levels of the stack, (d) verification techniques used
to provide guarantees that the functionality of complex designs are preserved,
and (e) energy efficiency standards and consortiums that aim to standardize
different aspects of energy efficiency, including cross-layer optimizations.
"
2004,"Exploiting Process Variations to Secure Photonic NoC Architectures from
  Snooping Attacks","  The compact size and high wavelength-selectivity of microring resonators
(MRs) enable photonic networks-on-chip (PNoCs) to utilize
dense-wavelength-division-multiplexing (DWDM) in their photonic waveguides, and
as a result, attain high bandwidth on-chip data transfers. Unfortunately, a
Hardware Trojan in a PNoC can manipulate the electrical driving circuit of its
MRs to cause the MRs to snoop data from the neighboring wavelength channels in
a shared photonic waveguide, which introduces a serious security threat. This
paper presents a framework that utilizes process variation-based authentication
signatures along with architecture-level enhancements to protect against
data-snooping Hardware Trojans during unicast as well as multicast transfers in
PNoCs. Evaluation results indicate that our framework can improve hardware
security across various PNoC architectures with minimal overheads of up to
14.2% in average latency and of up to 14.6% in energy-delay-product (EDP).
"
2005,A Generic Compilation Strategy for the Unitary Coupled Cluster Ansatz,"  We describe a compilation strategy for Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE)
algorithms which use the Unitary Coupled Cluster (UCC) ansatz, designed to
reduce circuit depth and gate count. This is achieved by partitioning Pauli
exponential terms into mutually commuting sets. These sets are then
diagonalised using Clifford circuits and synthesised using the phase polynomial
formalism. This strategy reduces cx depth by 75.4% on average, and by up to
89.9%, compared to naive synthesis for a variety of molecules, qubit encodings
and basis sets.
"
2006,"QUANTIFY: A framework for resource analysis and design verification of
  quantum circuits","  Quantum resource analysis is crucial for designing quantum circuits as well
as assessing the viability of arbitrary (error-corrected) quantum computations.
To this end, we introduce QUANTIFY, which is an open-source framework for the
quantitative analysis of quantum circuits. It is based on Google Cirq and is
developed with Clifford+T circuits in mind, and it includes the necessary
methods to handle Toffoli+H and more generalised controlled quantum gates, too.
Key features of QUANTIFY include: (1) analysis and optimisation methods which
are compatible with the surface code, (2) choice between different automated
(mixed polarity) Toffoli gate decompositions, (3) semi-automatic quantum
circuit rewriting and quantum gate insertion methods that take into account
known gate commutation rules, and (4) novel optimiser types that can be
combined with different verification methods (e.g. truth table or circuit
invariants like number of wires). For benchmarking purposes QUANTIFY includes
quantum memory and quantum arithmetic circuits. Experimental results show that
the framework's performance scales to circuits with thousands of qubits.

2007,Procedural generation using quantum computation,"  Quantum computation is an emerging technology that promises to be a powerful
tool in many areas. Though some years likely still remain until significant
quantum advantage is demonstrated, the development of the technology has led to
a range of valuable resources. These include publicly available prototype
quantum hardware, advanced simulators for small quantum programs and
programming frameworks to test and develop quantum software. In this
provocation paper we seek to demonstrate that these resources are sufficient to
provide the first useful results in the field of procedural generation. This is
done by introducing a proof-of-principle method: a quantum generalization of a
blurring process, in which quantum interference is used to provide a unique
effect. Through this we hope to show that further developments in the
technology are not required before it becomes useful for procedural generation.
Rather, fruitful experimentation with this new technology can begin now.

2008,"AM-DCGAN: Analog Memristive Hardware Accelerator for Deep Convolutional
  Generative Adversarial Networks","  Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is a well known computationally complex
algorithm requiring signficiant computational resources in software
implementations including large amount of data to be trained. This makes its
implementation in edge devices with conventional microprocessor hardware a slow
and difficult task. In this paper, we propose to accelerate the computationally
intensive GAN using memristive neural networks in analog domain. We present a
fully analog hardware design of Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN) based on
CMOS-memristive convolutional and deconvolutional networks simulated using
180nm CMOS technology.
"
2009,"Dopant Network Processing Units: Towards Efficient Neural-network
  Emulators with High-capacity Nanoelectronic Nodes","  The rapidly growing computational demands of deep neural networks require
novel hardware designs. Recently, tunable nanoelectronic devices were developed
based on hopping electrons through a network of dopant atoms in silicon. These
""Dopant Network Processing Units"" (DNPUs) are highly energy-efficient and have
potentially very high throughput. By adapting the control voltages applied to
its terminals, a single DNPU can solve a variety of linearly non-separable
classification problems. However, using a single device has limitations due to
the implicit single-node architecture. This paper presents a promising novel
approach to neural information processing by introducing DNPUs as high-capacity
neurons and moving from a single to a multi-neuron framework. By implementing
and testing a small multi-DNPU classifier in hardware, we show that
feed-forward DNPU networks improve the performance of a single DNPU from 77% to
94% test accuracy on a binary classification task with concentric classes on a
plane. Furthermore, motivated by the integration of DNPUs with memristor
arrays, we study the potential of using DNPUs in combination with linear
layers. We show by simulation that a single-layer MNIST classifier with only 10
DNPUs achieves over 96% test accuracy. Our results pave the road towards
hardware neural-network emulators that offer atomic-scale information
processing with low latency and energy consumption.
"
2010,CARAM: A Content-Aware Hybrid PCM/DRAM Main Memory System Framework,"  The emergence of Phase-Change Memory (PCM) provides opportunities for
directly connecting persistent memory to main memory bus. While PCM achieves
high read throughput and low standby power, the critical concerns are its poor
write performance and limited durability, especially when compared to DRAM. A
naturally inspired design is the hybrid memory architecture that fuses DRAM and
PCM, so as to exploit the positive aspects of both types of memory.
Unfortunately, existing solutions are seriously challenged by the limited main
memory size, which is the primary bottleneck of in-memory computing. In this
paper, we introduce a novel Content Aware hybrid PCM/DRAM main memory system
framework - CARAM, which exploits deduplication to improve line sharing with
high memory efficiency. CARAM effectively reduces write traffic to hybrid
memory by removing unnecessary duplicate line writes. It also substantially
extends available free memory space by coalescing redundant lines in hybrid
memory, thereby further improving the wear-leveling efficiency of PCM. To
obtain high data access performance, we also design a set of acceleration
techniques to minimize the overhead caused by extra computation costs. Our
experiment results show that CARAM effectively reduces 15%~42% of memory usage
and improves I/O bandwidth by 13%~116%, while saving 31%~38% energy
consumption, compared to the state-of-the-art of hybrid systems.

possible to be considered a complement to current wireless radio communication

2012,"Linear Delay-cell Design for Low-energy Delay Multiplication and
  Accumulation","  A practical deep neural network's (DNN) evaluation involves thousands of
multiply-and-accumulate (MAC) operations. To extend DNN's superior inference
capabilities to energy constrained devices, architectures and circuits that
minimize energy-per-MAC must be developed. In this respect, analog delay-based
MAC is advantageous due to reasons both extrinsic and intrinsic to the MAC
implementation - (1) lower fixed-point precision requirement for a DNN's
evaluation, (2) better dynamic range than charge-based accumulation, for
smaller technology nodes, and (3) simpler analog-digital interfacing.
Implementing DNNs using delay-based MAC requires mixed-signal delay multipliers
that accept digitally stored weights and analog voltages as arguments. To this
end, a novel, linearly tune-able delay-cell is proposed, wherein, the delay is
realized using an inverted MOS capacitor's (C*) steady discharge from a
linearly input-voltage dependent initial charge. The cell is analytically
modeled, constraints for its functional validity are determined, and
jitter-models are developed. Multiple cells with scaled delays, corresponding
to each bit of the digital argument, must be cascaded to form the multiplier.
To realize such bit-wise delay-scaling of the cells, a biasing circuit is
proposed that generates sub-threshold gate-voltages to scale C*'s discharging
rate, and thus area-expensive transistor width-scaling is avoided. For 130nm
CMOS technology, the theoretical constraints and limits on jitter are used to
find the optimal design-point and quantify the jitter versus
bits-per-multiplier trade-off. Schematic-level simulations show a worst-case
energy-consumption close to the state-of-art, and thus, feasibility of the
cell.
"
2013,"A Generalized Strong-Inversion CMOS Circuitry for Neuromorphic
  Applications","  It has always been a challenge in the neuromorphic field to systematically
translate biological models into analog electronic circuitry. In this paper, a
generalized circuit design platform is introduced where biological models can
be conveniently implemented using CMOS circuitry operating in strong-inversion.
The application of the method is demonstrated by synthesizing a relatively
complex two-dimensional (2-D) nonlinear neuron model. The validity of our
approach is verified by nominal simulated results with realistic process
parameters from the commercially available AMS 0.35 um technology. The circuit
simulation results exhibit regular spiking responses in good agreement with
their mathematical counterpart.
"
2014,"Implementation of Ternary Weights with Resistive RAM Using a Single
  Sense Operation per Synapse","  The design of systems implementing low precision neural networks with
emerging memories such as resistive random access memory (RRAM) is a
significant lead for reducing the energy consumption of artificial
intelligence. To achieve maximum energy efficiency in such systems, logic and
memory should be integrated as tightly as possible. In this work, we focus on
the case of ternary neural networks, where synaptic weights assume ternary
values. We propose a two-transistor/two-resistor memory architecture employing
a precharge sense amplifier, where the weight value can be extracted in a
single sense operation. Based on experimental measurements on a hybrid 130 nm
CMOS/RRAM chip featuring this sense amplifier, we show that this technique is
particularly appropriate at low supply voltage, and that it is resilient to
process, voltage, and temperature variations. We characterize the bit error
rate in our scheme. We show based on neural network simulation on the CIFAR-10
image recognition task that the use of ternary neural networks significantly
increases neural network performance, with regards to binary ones, which are
often preferred for inference hardware. We finally evidence that the neural
network is immune to the type of bit errors observed in our scheme, which can
therefore be used without error correction.
"
2015,Meta-optics for spatial optical analog computing,"  Rapidly growing demands for high-performance computing, powerful data
processing systems, and big data necessitate the advent of novel optical
devices to perform demanding computing processes effectively. Due to its
unprecedented growth in the past two decades, the field of meta-optics offers a
viable solution for spatially, spectrally, and/or even temporally sculpting
amplitude, phase, polarization, and/or dispersion of optical wavefronts. In
this Review, we discuss state-of-the-art developments as well as emerging
trends in computational meta-structures as disruptive platforms for spatial
optical analog computation. Two fundamental approaches based on general
concepts of spatial Fourier transformation and Green's function are discussed
in detail. Moreover, numerical investigations and experimental demonstrations
of computational optical surfaces and meta-structures for solving a diverse set
of mathematical problems (e.g., integro-differentiation and convolution
equations) necessary for on-demand applications (e.g., edge detection) are
reviewed. Finally, we explore the current challenges and the potential
resolutions in computational meta-optics followed by our perspective on future
research directions and possible developments in this promising area.
"
2016,A superconducting nanowire spiking element for neural networks,"  As the limits of traditional von Neumann computing come into view, the
brain's ability to communicate vast quantities of information using low-power
spikes has become an increasing source of inspiration for alternative
architectures. Key to the success of these largescale neural networks is a
power-efficient spiking element that is scalable and easily interfaced with
traditional control electronics. In this work, we present a spiking element
fabricated from superconducting nanowires that has pulse energies on the order
of ~10 aJ. We demonstrate that the device reproduces essential characteristics
of biological neurons, such as a refractory period and a firing threshold.
Through simulations using experimentally measured device parameters, we show
how nanowire-based networks may be used for inference in image recognition, and
that the probabilistic nature of nanowire switching may be exploited for
modeling biological processes and for applications that rely on stochasticity.
"
2017,"Faster Schr\""odinger-style simulation of quantum circuits","  Recent demonstrations of superconducting quantum computers by Google and IBM
and trapped-ion computers from IonQ fueled new research in quantum algorithms,
compilation into quantum circuits, and empirical algorithmics. While online
access to quantum hardware remains too limited to meet the demand, simulating
quantum circuits on conventional computers satisfies many needs. We advance
Schr\""odinger-style simulation of quantum circuits that is useful standalone
and as a building block in layered simulation algorithms, both cases are
illustrated in our results. Our algorithmic contributions show how to simulate
multiple quantum gates at once, how to avoid floating-point multiplies, how to
best use instruction-level and thread-level parallelism as well as CPU cache,
and how to leverage these optimizations by reordering circuit gates. While not
described previously, these techniques implemented by us supported published
high-performance distributed simulations up to 64 qubits. To show additional
impact, we benchmark our simulator against Microsoft, IBM and Google simulators
on hard circuits from Google.
"
2018,Complexity continuum within Ising formulation of NP problems,"  A promising approach to achieve computational supremacy over the classical
von Neumann architecture explores classical and quantum hardware as Ising
machines. The minimisation of the Ising Hamiltonian is known to be NP-hard
problem for certain interaction matrix classes, yet not all problem instances
are equivalently hard to optimise. We propose to identify computationally
simple instances with an `optimisation simplicity criterion'. Such optimisation
simplicity can be found for a wide range of models from spin glasses to
k-regular maximum cut problems. Many optical, photonic, and electronic systems
are neuromorphic architectures that can naturally operate to optimise problems
satisfying this criterion and, therefore, such problems are often chosen to
illustrate the computational advantages of new Ising machines. We further probe
an intermediate complexity for sparse and dense models by analysing circulant
coupling matrices, that can be `rewired' to introduce greater complexity. A
compelling approach for distinguishing easy and hard instances within the same
NP-hard class of problems can be a starting point in developing a standardised
procedure for the performance evaluation of emerging physical simulators and
physics-inspired algorithms.
"
2019,"Exploiting degeneracy to construct good ternary quantum error correcting
  code","  Quantum error-correcting code for higher dimensional systems can, in general,
be directly constructed from the codes for qubit systems. What remains unknown
is whether there exist efficient code design techniques for higher dimensional
systems. In this paper, we propose a 7-qutrit error-correcting code for the
ternary quantum system and show that this design formulation has no equivalence
in qubit systems. This code is optimum in the number of qutrits required to
correct a single error while maintaining the CSS structure. This degenerate CSS
code can (i) correct up to seven simultaneous phase errors and a single bit
error, (ii) correct two simultaneous bit errors on pre-defined pairs of qutrits
on eighteen out of twenty-one possible pairs, and (iii) in terms of the cost of
implementation, the depth of the circuit of this code is only two more than
that of the ternary Steane code. Our proposed code shows that it is possible to
design better codes explicitly for ternary quantum systems instead of simply
carrying over codes from binary quantum systems.
"
2020,Spiking neuromorphic chip learns entangled quantum states,"  Neuromorphic systems are designed to emulate certain structural and dynamical
properties of biological neuronal networks, with the aim of inheriting the
brain's functional performance and energy efficiency in artificial-intelligence
applications [1,2]. Among the platforms existing today, the spike-based
BrainScaleS system stands out by realizing fast analog dynamics which can boost
computationally expensive tasks [3]. Here we use the latest BrainScaleS
generation [4] for the algorithm-free simulation of quantum systems, thereby
opening up an entirely new application space for these devices. This requires
an appropriate spike-based representation of quantum states and an associated
training method for imprinting a desired target state onto the network. We
employ a representation of quantum states using probability distributions
[5,6], enabling the use of a Bayesian sampling framework for spiking neurons
[7]. For training, we developed a Hebbian learning scheme that explicitly
exploits the inherent speed of the substrate, which enables us to realize a
variety of network topologies. We encoded maximally entangled states of up to
four qubits and observed fidelities that imply genuine $N$-partite
entanglement. In particular, the encoding of entangled pure and mixed two-qubit
states reaches a quality that allows the observation of Bell correlations, thus
demonstrating that non-classical features of quantum systems can be captured by
spiking neural dynamics. Our work establishes an intriguing connection between
quantum systems and classical spiking networks, and demonstrates the
feasibility of simulating quantum systems with neuromorphic hardware.
"
2021,"SpinAPS: A High-Performance Spintronic Accelerator for Probabilistic
  Spiking Neural Networks","  We discuss a high-performance and high-throughput hardware accelerator for
probabilistic Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) based on Generalized Linear Model
(GLM) neurons, that uses binary STT-RAM devices as synapses and digital CMOS
logic for neurons. The inference accelerator, termed ""SpinAPS"" for Spintronic
Accelerator for Probabilistic SNNs, implements a principled direct learning
rule for first-to-spike decoding without the need for conversion from
pre-trained ANNs. The proposed solution is shown to achieve comparable
performance with an equivalent ANN on handwritten digit and human activity
recognition benchmarks. The inference engine, SpinAPS, is shown through
software emulation tools to achieve 4x performance improvement in terms of
GSOPS/W/mm2 when compared to an equivalent SRAM-based design. The architecture
leverages probabilistic spiking neural networks that employ first-to-spike
decoding rule to make inference decisions at low latencies, achieving 75% of
the test performance in as few as 4 algorithmic time steps on the handwritten
digit benchmark. The accelerator also exhibits competitive performance with
other memristor-based DNN/SNN accelerators and state-of-the-art GPUs.
"
2022,Machine Learning in Nano-Scale Biomedical Engineering,"  Machine learning (ML) empowers biomedical systems with the capability to
optimize their performance through modeling of the available data extremely
well, without using strong assumptions about the modeled system. Especially in
nano-scale biosystems, where the generated data sets are too vast and complex
to mentally parse without computational assist, ML is instrumental in analyzing
and extracting new insights, accelerating material and structure discoveries,
and designing experience as well as supporting nano-scale communications and
networks. However, despite these efforts, the use of ML in nano-scale
biomedical engineering remains still under-explored in certain areas and
research challenges are still open in fields such as structure and material
design and simulations, communications and signal processing, and bio-medicine
applications. In this article, we review the existing research regarding the
use of ML in nano-scale biomedical engineering. In more detail, we first
identify and discuss the main challenges that can be formulated as ML problems.
These challenges are classified into the three aforementioned main categories.
Next, we discuss the state of the art ML methodologies that are used to
countermeasure the aforementioned challenges. For each of the presented
methodologies, special emphasis is given to its principles, applications, and
limitations. Finally, we conclude the article with insightful discussions, that
reveal research gaps and highlight possible future research directions.
"
2023,Accuracy and Resiliency of Analog Compute-in-Memory Inference Engines,"  Recently, analog compute-in-memory (CIM) architectures based on emerging
analog non-volatile memory (NVM) technologies have been explored for deep
neural networks (DNN) to improve energy efficiency. Such architectures,
however, leverage charge conservation, an operation with infinite resolution,
and thus are susceptible to errors. The computations in DNN realized by analog
NVM thus have high uncertainty due to the device stochasticity. Several reports
have demonstrated the use of analog NVM for CIM in a limited scale. It is
unclear whether the uncertainties in computations will prohibit large-scale
DNNs. To explore this critical issue of scalability, this paper first presents
a simulation framework to evaluate the feasibility of large-scale DNNs based on
CIM architecture and analog NVM. Simulation results show that DNNs trained for
high-precision digital computing engines are not resilient against the
uncertainty of the analog NVM devices. To avoid such catastrophic failures,
this paper introduces the analog floating-point representation for the DNN, and
the Hessian-Aware Stochastic Gradient Descent (HA-SGD) training algorithm to
enhance the inference accuracy of trained DNNs. As a result of such
enhancements, DNNs such as Wide ResNets for the CIFAR-100 image recognition
problem are demonstrated to have significant performance improvements in
accuracy without adding cost to the inference hardware.

2024,"Helix: Algorithm/Architecture Co-design for Accelerating Nanopore Genome
  Base-calling","  Nanopore genome sequencing is the key to enabling personalized medicine,
global food security, and virus surveillance. The state-of-the-art base-callers
adopt deep neural networks (DNNs) to translate electrical signals generated by
nanopore sequencers to digital DNA symbols. A DNN-based base-caller consumes
$44.5\%$ of total execution time of a nanopore sequencing pipeline. However, it
is difficult to quantize a base-caller and build a power-efficient
processing-in-memory (PIM) to run the quantized base-caller. In this paper, we
propose a novel algorithm/architecture co-designed PIM, Helix, to
power-efficiently and accurately accelerate nanopore base-calling. From
algorithm perspective, we present systematic error aware training to minimize
the number of systematic errors in a quantized base-caller. From architecture
perspective, we propose a low-power SOT-MRAM-based ADC array to process
analog-to-digital conversion operations and improve power efficiency of prior
DNN PIMs. Moreover, we revised a traditional NVM-based dot-product engine to
accelerate CTC decoding operations, and create a SOT-MRAM binary comparator
array to process read voting. Compared to state-of-the-art PIMs, Helix improves
base-calling throughput by $6\times$, throughput per Watt by $11.9\times$ and
per $mm^2$ by $7.5\times$ without degrading base-calling accuracy.

2025,Scaling of Multi-contact Phase Change Device for Toggle Logic Operations,"  Scaling of two dimensional six-contact phase change devices that can perform
toggle logic operations is analyzed through 2D electrothermal simulations with
dynamic materials modeling, integrated with CMOS access circuitry. Toggle
configurations are achieved through a combination of isolation of some contacts
from others using amorphous regions and coupling between different regions via
thermal crosstalk. Use of thermal crosstalk as a coupling mechanism in a
multi-contact device in the memory layer allows implementation of analog
routing and digital logic operations at a significantly lower transistor count,
with the added benefit of non-volatility. Simulation results show approximately
linear improvement in peak current and voltage requirements with thickness
scaling.

2026,"Experimental Demonstration of a Reconfigurable Coupled Oscillator
  Platform to Solve the Max-Cut Problem","  In this work, we experimentally demonstrate an integrated circuit (IC) of 30
relaxation oscillators with reconfigurable capacitive coupling to solve the
NP-Hard Maximum Cut (Max-Cut) problem. We show that under the influence of an
external second-harmonic injection signal, the oscillator phases exhibit a
bi-partition which can be used to calculate a high quality approximate Max-Cut
solution. Leveraging the all-to-all reconfigurable coupling architecture, we
experimentally evaluate the computational properties of the oscillators using
randomly generated graph instances of varying size and edge density . Further,
comparing the Max-Cut solutions with the optimal values, we show that the
oscillators (after simple post-processing) produce a Max-Cut that is within 99%
of the optimal value in 28 of the 36 measured graphs; importantly, the
oscillators are particularly effective in dense graphs with the Max-Cut being
optimal in seven out of nine measured graphs with edge density 0.8. Our work
marks a step towards creating an efficient, room-temperature-compatible
non-Boolean hardware-based solver for hard combinatorial optimization problems.

2027,"Driver Assistance for Safe and Comfortable On-Ramp Merging Using
  Environment Models Extended through V2X Communication and Role-Based Behavior
  Predictions","  Modern driver assistance systems as well as autonomous vehicles take their
decisions based on local maps of the environment. These maps include, for
example, surrounding moving objects perceived by sensors as well as routes and
navigation information. Current research in the field of environment mapping is
concerned with two major challenges. The first one is the integration of
information from different sources e.g. on-board sensors like radar, camera,
ultrasound and lidar, offline map data or backend information. The second
challenge comprises in finding an abstract representation of this aggregated
information with suitable interfaces for different driving functions and
traffic situations. To overcome these challenges, an extended environment model
is a reasonable choice. In this paper, we show that role-based motion
predictions in combination with v2x-extended environment models are able to
contribute to increased traffic safety and driving comfort. Thus, we combine
the mentioned research areas and show possible improvements, using the example
of a threading process at a motorway access road. Furthermore, it is shown that
already an average v2x equipment penetration of 80% can lead to a significant
improvement of 0.33m/s^2 of the total acceleration and 12m more safety distance
compared to non v2x-equipped vehicles during the threading process.
"
2028,Fan-out and Fan-in properties of superconducting neuromorphic circuits,"  Neuromorphic computing has the potential to further the success of
software-based artificial neural networks (ANNs) by designing hardware from a
different perspective. Current research in neuromorphic hardware targets
dramatic improvements to ANN performance by increasing energy efficiency, speed
of operation, and even seeks to extend the utility of ANNs by natively adding
functionality such as spiking operation. One promising neuromorphic hardware
platform is based on superconductive electronics, which has the potential to
incorporate all of these advantages at the device level in addition to offering
the potential of near lossless communications both within the neuromorphic
circuits as well as between disparate superconductive chips. Here we explore
one of the fundamental brain-inspired architecture components, the fan-in and
fan-out as realized in superconductive circuits based on Josephson junctions.
From our calculations and WRSPICE simulations we find that the fan-out should
be limited only by junction count and circuit size limitations, and we
demonstrate results in simulation at a level of 1-to-10,000, similar to that of
the human brain. We find that fan-in has more limitations, but a fan-in level
on the order of a few 100-to-1 should be achievable based on current
technology. We discuss our findings and the critical parameters that set the
limits on fan-in and fan-out in the context of superconductive neuromorphic
circuits.
"
2029,Quantum advantage for computations with limited space,"  Quantum computations promise the ability to solve problems intractable in the
classical setting. Restricting the types of computations considered often
allows to establish a provable theoretical advantage by quantum computations,
and later demonstrate it experimentally. In this paper, we consider
space-restricted computations, where input is a read-only memory and only one
(qu)bit can be computed on. We show that $n$-bit symmetric Boolean functions
can be implemented exactly through the use of quantum signal processing as
restricted space quantum computations using $O(n^2)$ gates, but some of them
may only be evaluated with probability $\frac{1}{2} {+}
\tilde{O}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}})$ by analogously defined classical computations.
We experimentally demonstrate computations of $3$- and a $4$-bit symmetric
Boolean functions by quantum circuits, leveraging custom two-qubit gates, with
algorithmic success probability exceeding the best possible classically. This
establishes and experimentally verifies a different kind of quantum advantage
-- one where a quantum bit stores more useful information for the purpose of
computation than a classical bit. This suggests that in computations, quantum
scrap space is more valuable than analogous classical space and calls for an
in-depth exploration of space-time tradeoffs in quantum circuits.
"
2030,"Breaking Barriers: Maximizing Array Utilization for Compute In-Memory
  Fabrics","  Compute in-memory (CIM) is a promising technique that minimizes data
transport, the primary performance bottleneck and energy cost of most data
intensive applications. This has found wide-spread adoption in accelerating
neural networks for machine learning applications. Utilizing a crossbar
architecture with emerging non-volatile memories (eNVM) such as dense resistive
random access memory (RRAM) or phase change random access memory (PCRAM),
various forms of neural networks can be implemented to greatly reduce power and
increase on chip memory capacity. However, compute in-memory faces its own
limitations at both the circuit and the device levels. Although compute
in-memory using the crossbar architecture can greatly reduce data transport,
the rigid nature of these large fixed weight matrices forfeits the flexibility
of traditional CMOS and SRAM based designs. In this work, we explore the
different synchronization barriers that occur from the CIM constraints.
Furthermore, we propose a new allocation algorithm and data flow based on input
data distributions to maximize utilization and performance for compute-in
memory based designs. We demonstrate a 7.47$\times$ performance improvement
over a naive allocation method for CIM accelerators on ResNet18.
"
2031,Versatile Filamentary Resistive Switching Model,"  Memristors as emergent nano-electronic devices have been successfully
fabricated and used in non-conventional and neuromorphic computing systems in
the last years. Several behavioral or physical based models have been developed
to explain their operation and to optimize their fabrication parameters. All
existing memristor models are trade-offs between accuracy, universality and
realism, but, to the best of our knowledge, none of them is purely
characterized as quantum mechanical, despite the fact that quantum mechanical
processes are a major part of the memristor operation. In this paper, we employ
quantum mechanical methods to develop a complete and accurate filamentary model
for the resistance variation during memristor's operating cycle. More
specifically, we apply quantum walks to model and compute the motion of atoms
forming the filament, tight-binding Hamiltonians to capture the filament
structure and the Non-Equilibrium Green's Function (NEGF) method to compute the
conductance of the device. Furthermore, we proceeded with the parallelization
of the overall model through Graphical Processing Units (GPUs) to accelerate
our computations and enhance the model's performance adequately. Our simulation
results successfully reproduce the resistive switching characteristics of
memristors devices, match with existing fabricated devices experimental data,
prove the efficacy and robustness of the proposed model in terms of
multi-parameterization, and provide a new and useful insight into its
operation.

2032,"PROTEUS: Rule-Based Self-Adaptation in Photonic NoCs for Loss-Aware
  Co-Management of Laser Power and Performance","  The performance of on-chip communication in the state-of-the-art multi-core
processors that use the traditional electron-ic NoCs has already become
severely energy-constrained. To that end, emerging photonic NoCs (PNoC) are
seen as a po-tential solution to improve the energy-efficiency (performance per
watt) of on-chip communication. However, existing PNoC designs cannot realize
their full potential due to their exces-sive laser power consumption. Prior
works that attempt to improve laser power efficiency in PNoCs do not consider
all key factors that affect the laser power requirement of PNoCs. Therefore,
they cannot yield the desired balance between the reduction in laser power,
achieved performance and energy-efficiency in PNoCs. In this paper, we present
PROTEUS framework that employs rule-based self-adaptation in PNoCs. Our
approach not only reduces the laser power consumption, but also minimizes the
average packet latency by opportunis-tically increasing the communication data
rate in PNoCs, and thus, yields the desired balance between the laser power
re-duction, performance, and energy-efficiency in PNoCs. Our evaluation with
PARSEC benchmarks shows that our PROTEUS framework can achieve up to 24.5% less
laser power consumption, up to 31% less average packet latency, and up to 20%
less energy-per-bit, compared to another laser power management technique from
prior work.

2033,A Passive Circuit-Emulator for a Current-controlled Memristor,"  A memristor is an electrical element, which has been conjectured in 1971 to
complete the lumped circuit theory. Currently, researchers use memristors
emulators through diodes and other passive (or active) elements to study
circuits with possible attractors, chaos, and ways of implementing nonlinear
transformations for low-voltage novel computing paradigms. However, to date,
such passive memristor emulators have been voltage-controlled. In this study,
the first circuit realization of a current-controlled passive emulator is
established. The formal theory and simulations validate the proposed circuit.
"
2034,Characterizing the Stability of NISQ Devices,"  In this study, we focus on the question of stability of NISQ devices. The
parameters that define the device stability profile are motivated by the work
of DiVincenzo where the requirements for physical implementation of quantum
computing are discussed. We develop the metrics and theoretical framework to
quantify the DiVincenzo requirements and study the stability of those key
metrics. The basis of our assessment is histogram similarity (in time and
space). For identical experiments, devices which produce reproducible
histograms in time, and similar histograms in space, are considered more
reliable. To investigate such reliability concerns robustly, we propose a
moment-based distance (MBD) metric. We illustrate our methodology using data
collected from IBM's Yorktown device. Two types of assessments are discussed:
spatial stability and temporal stability.
"
2035,Fungal sensing skin,"  A fungal skin is a thin flexible sheet of a living homogeneous mycelium made
by a filamentous fungus. The skin could be used in future living architectures
of adaptive buildings and as a sensing living skin for soft
self-growing/adaptive robots. In experimental laboratory studies we demonstrate
that the fungal skin is capable for recognising mechanical and optical
stimulation. The skin reacts differently to loading of a weight, removal of the
weight, and switching illumination on and off. These are the first experimental
evidences that fungal materials can be used not only as mechanical `skeletons'
in architecture and robotics but also as intelligent skins capable for
recognition of external stimuli and sensorial fusion.

2036,"A Cost & Performance-Efficient Field-Programmable Pin-Constrained
  Digital Microfluidic Biochip","  Digital microfluidic biochips (DMFBs) constitute modern generation of
Lab-on-Chip (LoC) devices aimed at automation, miniaturization and
cost-affordability of biochemistry and laboratory procedures. Over the course
of past few years there have been various application-specific and
general-purpose DMFBs aimed at reduced manufacturing costs; following the same
trend this study presents a general-purpose DMFB with highly competitive
characteristics compared with the state-of-the-art DMFBs. The proposed DMFB
architecture provides lower Layout / PCB fabrication costs thereby reducing the
total manufacturing costs. While more cost-affordable the proposed design is
competitive with the state-of-the-art DMFB architectures.

2037,Electrical activity of fungi: Spikes detection and complexity analysis,"  Oyster fungi \emph{Pleurotus djamor} generate actin potential like spikes of
electrical potential. The trains of spikes might manifest propagation of
growing mycelium in a substrate, transportation of nutrients and metabolites
and communication processes in the mycelium network. The spiking activity of
the mycelium networks is highly variable compared to neural activity and
therefore can not be analysed by standard tools from neuroscience. We propose
original techniques for detecting and classifying the spiking activity of
fungi. Using these techniques, we analyse the information-theoretic complexity
of the fungal electrical activity. The results can pave ways for future
research on sensorial fusion and decision making of fungi.

2038,"Rethinking Non-idealities in Memristive Crossbars for Adversarial
  Robustness in Neural Networks","  \textit{Deep Neural Networks} (DNNs) have been shown to be prone to
adversarial attacks. With a growing need to enable intelligence in embedded
devices in this \textit{Internet of Things} (IoT) era, secure hardware
implementation of DNNs has become imperative. Memristive crossbars, being able
to perform \textit{Matrix-Vector-Multiplications} (MVMs) efficiently, are used
to realize DNNs on hardware. However, crossbar non-idealities have always been
devalued since they cause errors in performing MVMs, leading to degradation in
the accuracy of the DNNs. Several software-based adversarial defenses have been
proposed in the past to make DNNs adversarially robust. However, no previous
work has demonstrated the advantage conferred by the non-idealities present in
analog crossbars in terms of adversarial robustness. In this work, we show that
the intrinsic hardware variations manifested through crossbar non-idealities
yield adversarial robustness to the mapped DNNs without any additional
optimization. We evaluate resilience of state-of-the-art DNNs (VGG8 \& VGG16
networks) using benchmark datasets (CIFAR-10 \& CIFAR-100) across various
crossbar sizes towards both hardware and software adversarial attacks. We find
that crossbar non-idealities unleash greater adversarial robustness
($>10-20\%$) in DNNs than baseline software DNNs. We further assess the
performance of our approach with other state-of-the-art efficiency-driven
adversarial defenses and find that our approach performs significantly well in
terms of reducing adversarial losses.
"
2039,"Robustness Hidden in Plain Sight: Can Analog Computing Defend Against
  Adversarial Attacks?","  The ever-increasing computational demand of Deep Learning has propelled
research in special-purpose inference accelerators based on emerging
non-volatile memory (NVM) technologies. Such NVM crossbars promise fast and
energy-efficient in-situ matrix vector multiplications (MVM) thus alleviating
the long-standing von Neuman bottleneck in today's digital hardware. However
the analog nature of computing in these NVM crossbars introduces approximations
in the MVM operations. In this paper, we study the impact of these
non-idealities on the performance of DNNs under adversarial attacks. The
non-ideal behavior interferes with the computation of the exact gradient of the
model, which is required for adversarial image generation. In a non-adaptive
attack, where the attacker is unaware of the analog hardware, we show that
analog computing offers a varying degree of intrinsic robustness, with a peak
adversarial accuracy improvement of 35.34%, 22.69%, and 31.70% for white box
PGD ($\epsilon$=1/255, iter=30) for CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet(top-5)
respectively. We also demonstrate ""hardware-in-loop"" adaptive attacks that
circumvent this robustness by utilizing the knowledge of the NVM model. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first work that explores the non-idealities
of analog computing for adversarial robustness at the time of submission to
NeurIPS 2020.
"
2040,Optical Neural Networks: The 3D connection,"  We motivate a new canonical strategy for integrating photonic neural networks
(NNs) by leveraging 3D printing. Our believe is that a NN's parallel and dense
connectivity is not scalable without 3D integration. 3D additive fabrication
complemented with photonic signal transduction can dramatically augment the
current capabilities of 2D CMOS and integrated photonics. Here we review some
of our recent advances made towards such a breakthrough architecture.

2041,"Towards Building A Facial Identification System Using Quantum Machine
  Learning Techniques","  In the modern world, facial identification is an extremely important task in
which many applications rely on high performing algorithms to detect faces
efficiently. Whilst classical methods of SVM and k-NN commonly used may perform
to a good standard, they are often highly complex and take substantial
computing power to run effectively. With the rise of quantum computing boasting
large speedups without sacrificing large amounts of much needed performance, we
aim to explore the benefits that quantum machine learning techniques can bring
when specifically targeted towards facial identification applications. In the
following work, we explore a quantum scheme which uses fidelity estimations of
feature vectors in order to determine the classification result. Here, we are
able to achieve exponential speedups by utilizing the principles of quantum
computing without sacrificing large proportions of performance in terms of
classification accuracy. We also propose limitations of the work and where some
future efforts should be placed in order to produce robust quantum algorithms
that can perform to the same standard as classical methods whilst utilizing the
speedup performance gains.

2042,Floating-Point Multiplication Using Neuromorphic Computing,"  Neuromorphic computing describes the use of VLSI systems to mimic
neuro-biological architectures and is also looked at as a promising alternative
to the traditional von Neumann architecture. Any new computing architecture
would need a system that can perform floating-point arithmetic. In this paper,
we describe a neuromorphic system that performs IEEE 754-compliant
floating-point multiplication. The complex process of multiplication is divided
into smaller sub-tasks performed by components Exponent Adder, Bias Subtractor,
Mantissa Multiplier and Sign OF/UF. We study the effect of the number of
neurons per bit on accuracy and bit error rate, and estimate the optimal number
of neurons needed for each component.
"
2043,"Low-Cost Performance-Efficient Field-Programmable Pin-Constrained
  Digital Microfluidic Biochip","  Digital microfluidic biochips (DMFBs) are revolutionary biomedical devices
towards diagnostics and point-of-care applications; the chips provide the
capability of performing wide ranges of biochemistry and laboratory procedures,
offering various opportunities among which to mention are automation,
miniaturization and cost-affordability of bioassays. There have been various
digital microfluidic biochips architectures; the application-specific chips are
mainly suited towards executing a predefined set of bioassays whereas the more
flexible general-purpose chips allow executing wide ranges of bioassays on the
same architecture. Though more flexible in terms of performing various
bioassays the general-purpose chips require more complicated designs compared
with application-specific counterparts necessitating larger and more costly
designs. This paper attempts to propose a general-purpose field-programmable
pin-constrained DMFB design with improved characteristics in terms
area-consumption, manufacturing cost and performance.
"
2044,"Double-IRS Assisted Multi-User MIMO: Cooperative Passive Beamforming
  Design","  Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) has emerged as an enabling technology to
achieve smart and reconfigurable wireless communication environment
cost-effectively. Prior works on IRS mainly consider its passive beamforming
design and performance optimization without the inter-IRS signal reflection,
which thus do not unveil the full potential of multi-IRS assisted wireless
networks. In this paper, we study a double-IRS assisted multi-user
communication system with the \emph{cooperative} passive beamforming design
that captures the multiplicative beamforming gain from the inter-IRS channel.
Under the general channel setup with the co-existence of both double- and
single-reflection links, we jointly optimize the (active) receive beamforming
at the base station (BS) and the cooperative (passive) reflect beamforming at
the two distributed IRSs (deployed near the BS and users, respectively) to
maximize the minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of all
users. Moreover, for the single-user and multi-user setups, we analytically
show the superior performance of the double-IRS cooperative system over the
conventional single-IRS system in terms of the maximum signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) and multi-user effective channel rank, respectively. Simulation results
validate our analytical results and show the practical advantages of the
proposed double-IRS system with cooperative passive beamforming designs.
"
2045,"A Survey of Molecular Communication in Cell Biology: Establishing a New
  Hierarchy for Interdisciplinary Applications","  Molecular communication (MC) engineering is inspired by the use of chemical
signals as information carriers in cell biology. The biological nature of
chemical signaling makes MC a promising methodology for interdisciplinary
applications requiring communication between cells and other microscale
devices. However, since the life sciences and communications engineering fields
have distinct approaches to formulating and solving research problems, the
mismatch between them can hinder the translation of research results and impede
the development and implementation of interdisciplinary solutions. To bridge
this gap, this survey proposes a novel communication hierarchy for MC signaling
in cell biology and maps phenomena, contributions, and problems to the
hierarchy. The hierarchy includes: 1) the Physical Signal Propagation level; 2)
the Physical and Chemical Signal Interaction level; 3) the Signal-Data
Interface level; 4) the Local Data Abstraction level; and 5) the Application
level. To further demonstrate the proposed hierarchy, it is applied to case
studies on quorum sensing, neuronal signaling, and communication via DNA.
Finally, several open problems are identified for each level and the
integration of multiple levels. The proposed hierarchy provides language for
communication engineers to study and interface with biological systems, and
also helps biologists to understand how communications engineering concepts can
be exploited to interpret, control, and manipulate signaling in cell biology.
"
2046,The Computational Capacity of Memristor Reservoirs,"  Reservoir computing is a machine learning paradigm in which a
high-dimensional dynamical system, or \emph{reservoir}, is used to approximate
and perform predictions on time series data. Its simple training procedure
allows for very large reservoirs that can provide powerful computational
capabilities. The scale, speed and power-usage characteristics of reservoir
computing could be enhanced by constructing reservoirs out of electronic
circuits, but this requires a precise understanding of how such circuits
process and store information. We analyze the feasibility and optimal design of
such reservoirs by considering the equations of motion of circuits that include
both linear elements (resistors, inductors, and capacitors) and nonlinear
memory elements (called memristors). This complements previous studies, which
have examined such systems through simulation and experiment. We provide
analytic results regarding the fundamental feasibility of such reservoirs, and
give a systematic characterization of their computational properties, examining
the types of input-output relationships that may be approximated. This allows
us to design reservoirs with optimal properties in terms of their ability to
reconstruct a certain signal (or functions thereof). In particular, by
introducing measures of the total linear and nonlinear computational capacities
of the reservoir, we are able to design electronic circuits whose total
computation capacity scales linearly with the system size. Comparison with
conventional echo state reservoirs show that these electronic reservoirs can
match or exceed their performance in a form that may be directly implemented in
hardware.

2047,"AIDX: Adaptive Inference Scheme to Mitigate State-Drift in Memristive
  VMM Accelerators","  An adaptive inference method for crossbar (AIDX) is presented based on an
optimization scheme for adjusting the duration and amplitude of input voltage
pulses. AIDX minimizes the long-term effects of memristance drift on artificial
neural network accuracy. The sub-threshold behavior of memristor has been
modeled and verified by comparing with fabricated device data. The proposed
method has been evaluated by testing on different network structures and
applications, e.g., image reconstruction and classification tasks. The results
showed an average of 60% improvement in convolutional neural network (CNN)
performance on CIFAR10 dataset after 10000 inference operations as well as
78.6% error reduction in image reconstruction.
"
2048,On resistive spiking of fungi,"  We study long-term electrical resistance dynamics in mycelium and fruit
bodies of oyster fungi P. ostreatus. A nearly homogeneous sheet of mycelium on
the surface of a growth substrate exhibits trains of resistance spikes. The
average width of spikes is c.~23~min and the average amplitude is c.~1~kOhm.
The distance between neighbouring spikes in a train of spikes is c.~30~min.
Typically there are 4-6 spikes in a train of spikes. Two types of resistance
spikes trains are found in fruit bodies: low frequency and high amplitude
(28~min spike width, 1.6~kOhm amplitude, 57~min distance between spikes) and
high frequency and low amplitude (10~min width, 0.6~kOhm amplitude, 44~min
distance between spikes). The findings could be applied in monitoring of
physiological states of fungi and future development of living electronic
devices and sensors.
"
2049,"Reversible Computing with Fast, Fully Static, Fully Adiabatic CMOS","  To advance the energy efficiency of general digital computing far beyond the
thermodynamic limits that apply to conventional digital circuits will require
utilizing the principles of reversible computing. It has been known since the
early 1990s that reversible computing based on adiabatic switching is possible
in CMOS, although almost all of the ""adiabatic"" CMOS logic families in the
literature are not actually fully adiabatic, which limits their achievable
energy savings. The first CMOS logic style that achieved truly, fully adiabatic
operation if leakage was negligible (CRL) is not fully static, which leads to a
number of practical engineering difficulties in the presence of certain
nonidealities. Later, ""static"" adiabatic logic families were described, but
they were not actually fully adiabatic, or fully static, and were much slower.
  In this paper, we describe a new logic family, Static 2-Level Adiabatic Logic
(S2LAL), which is, to our knowledge, the first CMOS logic family that is both
fully static, and truly, fully adiabatic (modulo leakage). In addition, S2LAL
is, we think, the fastest possible such family (among fully pipelined
sequential circuits), having a latency per logic stage of one ""tick""
(transition time), and a minimum clock period (initiation interval) of 8 ticks.
S2LAL requires 8 phases of a trapezoidal power-clock waveform (plus constant
power and ground references) to be supplied. We argue that, if implemented in a
suitable fabrication process designed to aggressively minimize leakage, S2LAL
should be capable of demonstrating a greater level of energy efficiency than
any other semiconductor-based digital logic family known today.
"
2050,"Direct CMOS Implementation of Neuromorphic Temporal Neural Networks for
  Sensory Processing","  Temporal Neural Networks (TNNs) use time as a resource to represent and
process information, mimicking the behavior of the mammalian neocortex. This
work focuses on implementing TNNs using off-the-shelf digital CMOS technology.
A microarchitecture framework is introduced with a hierarchy of building blocks
including: multi-neuron columns, multi-column layers, and multi-layer TNNs. We
present the direct CMOS gate-level implementation of the multi-neuron column
model as the key building block for TNNs. Post-synthesis results are obtained
using Synopsys tools and the 45 nm CMOS standard cell library. The TNN
microarchitecture framework is embodied in a set of characteristic equations
for assessing the total gate count, die area, compute time, and power
consumption for any TNN design. We develop a multi-layer TNN prototype of 32M
gates. In 7 nm CMOS process, it consumes only 1.54 mm^2 die area and 7.26 mW
power and can process 28x28 images at 107M FPS (9.34 ns per image). We evaluate
the prototype's performance and complexity relative to a recent
state-of-the-art TNN model.
"
2051,Turning machines,"  Molecular robotics is challenging, so it seems best to keep it simple. We
consider an abstract molecular robotics model based on simple folding
instructions that execute asynchronously. Turning Machines are a simple 1D to
2D folding model, also easily generalisable to 2D to 3D folding. A Turning
Machine starts out as a line of connected monomers in the discrete plane, each
with an associated turning number. A monomer turns relative to its neighbours,
executing a unit-distance translation that drags other monomers along with it,
and through collective motion the initial set of monomers eventually folds into
a programmed shape. We fully characterise the ability of Turning Machines to
execute line rotations, and to do so efficiently: computing an almost-full line
rotation of $5\pi/3$ radians is possible, yet a full $2\pi$ rotation is
impossible. We show that such line-rotations represent a fundamental primitive
in the model, by using them to efficiently and asynchronously fold arbitrarily
large zig-zag-rastered squares and $y$-monotone shapes.
"
2052,Fully analog memristive circuits for optimization tasks: a comparison,"  We introduce a Lyapunov function for the dynamics of memristive circuits, and
compare the effectiveness of memristors in minimizing the function to widely
used optimization software. We study in particular three classes of problems
which can be directly embedded in a circuit topology, and show that memristors
effectively attempt at (quickly) extremizing these functionals.
"
2053,"CONTRA: Area-Constrained Technology Mapping Framework For Memristive
  Memory Processing Unit","  Data-intensive applications are poised to benefit directly from
processing-in-memory platforms, such as memristive Memory Processing Units,
which allow leveraging data locality and performing stateful logic operations.
Developing design automation flows for such platforms is a challenging and
highly relevant research problem. In this work, we investigate the problem of
minimizing delay under arbitrary area constraint for MAGIC-based in-memory
computing platforms. We propose an end-to-end area constrained technology
mapping framework, CONTRA. CONTRA uses Look-Up Table(LUT) based mapping of the
input function on the crossbar array to maximize parallel operations and uses a
novel search technique to move data optimally inside the array. CONTRA supports
benchmarks in a variety of formats, along with crossbar dimensions as input to
generate MAGIC instructions. CONTRA scales for large benchmarks, as
demonstrated by our experiments. CONTRA allows mapping benchmarks to smaller
crossbar dimensions than achieved by any other technique before, while allowing
a wide variety of area-delay trade-offs. CONTRA improves the composite metric
of area-delay product by 2.1x to 13.1x compared to seven existing technology
mapping approaches.

2054,"Ultrafast non-volatile flash memory based on van der Waals
  heterostructures","  Flash memory has become a ubiquitous solid-state memory device, it is widely
used in portable digital devices, computers, and enterprise applications. The
development of the information age has put forward higher requirements for
memory speed and retention performance. Here, we demonstrate an ultrafast
non-volatile memory based on MoS2/h-BN/multi-layer graphene (MLG) van der Waals
heterostructures, which has an atomic-level flat interface and achieves
ultrafast writing/erasing speed (~20 ns), surpassing the reported
state-of-the-art flash memory (~100 ns). The ultrafast flash memory could lay
the foundation for the next-generation of high-speed non-volatile memory.
"
2055,"Virtualized Logical Qubits: A 2.5D Architecture for Error-Corrected
  Quantum Computing","  Current, near-term quantum devices have shown great progress in recent years
culminating with a demonstration of quantum supremacy. In the medium-term,
however, quantum machines will need to transition to greater reliability
through error correction, likely through promising techniques such as surface
codes which are well suited for near-term devices with limited qubit
connectivity. We discover quantum memory, particularly resonant cavities with
transmon qubits arranged in a 2.5D architecture, can efficiently implement
surface codes with substantial hardware savings and performance/fidelity gains.
Specifically, we *virtualize logical qubits* by storing them in layers
distributed across qubit memories connected to each transmon.
  Surprisingly, distributing each logical qubit across many memories has a
minimal impact on fault tolerance and results in substantially more efficient
operations. Our design permits fast transversal CNOT operations between logical
qubits sharing the same physical address which are 6x faster than lattice
surgery CNOTs. We develop a novel embedding which saves ~10x in transmons with
another 2x from an additional optimization for compactness.
  Although Virtualized Logical Qubits (VLQ) pays a 10x penalty in
serialization, advantages in the transversal CNOT and area efficiency result in
performance comparable to 2D transmon-only architectures. Our simulations show
fault tolerance comparable to 2D architectures while saving substantial
hardware. Furthermore, VLQ can produce magic states 1.22x faster for a fixed
number of transmon qubits. This is a critical benchmark for future
fault-tolerant quantum computers. VLQ substantially reduces the hardware
requirements for fault tolerance and puts within reach a proof-of-concept
experimental demonstration of around 10 logical qubits, requiring only 11
transmons and 9 attached cavities in total.
"
2056,"SlackQ : Approaching the Qubit Mapping Problem with A Slack-aware Swap
  Insertion Scheme","  The rapid progress of physical implementation of quantum computers paved the
way for the design of tools to help users write quantum programs for any given
quantum device. The physical constraints inherent in current NISQ architectures
prevent most quantum algorithms from being directly executed on quantum
devices. To enable two-qubit gates in the algorithm, existing works focus on
inserting SWAP gates to dynamically remap logical qubits to physical qubits.
However, their schemes lack consideration of the execution time of generated
quantum circuits. In this work, we propose a slack-aware SWAP insertion scheme
for the qubit mapping problem in the NISQ era. Our experiments show performance
improvement by up to 2.36X at maximum, by 1.62X on average, over 106
representative benchmarks from RevLib, IBM Qiskit , and ScaffCC.
"
2057,Low-cost Active Dry-Contact Surface EMG Sensor for Bionic Arms,"  Surface electromyography (sEMG) is a popular bio-signal used for controlling
prostheses and finger gesture recognition mechanisms. Myoelectric prostheses
are costly, and most commercially available sEMG acquisition systems are not
suitable for real-time gesture recognition. In this paper, a method of
acquiring sEMG signals using novel low-cost, active, dry-contact, flexible
sensors has been proposed. Since the active sEMG sensor was developed to be
used along with a bionic arm, the sensor was tested for its ability to acquire
sEMG signals that could be used for real-time classification of five selected
gestures. In a study of 4 subjects, the average classification accuracy for
real-time gesture classification using the active sEMG sensor system was 85%.
The common-mode rejection ratio of the sensor was measured to 59 dB, and thus
the sensor's performance was not substantially limited by its active circuitry.
The proposed sensors can be interfaced with a variety of amplifiers to perform
fully wearable sEMG acquisition. This satisfies the need for a low-cost sEMG
acquisition system for prostheses.

2058,"Mitiq: A software package for error mitigation on noisy quantum

computation using zero-noise extrapolation. Error mitigation techniques improve
computational performance (with respect to noise) with minimal overhead in
quantum resources by relying on a mixture of quantum sampling and classical
post-processing techniques. Our error mitigation package interfaces with
multiple quantum computing software stacks, and we demonstrate improved
performance on IBM and Rigetti superconducting quantum processors as well as
noisy simulators. We describe the library using code snippets to demonstrate
usage and discuss features and contribution guidelines.

2059,"Digital Signal Processing for Molecular Communication via Chemical
  Reactions-based Microfluidic Circuits","  Chemical reactions-based microfluidic circuits are expected to provide new
opportunities to perform signal processing functions over molecular domain. To
realize this vision, in this article, we exploit and present the digital signal
processing capabilities of chemical reactions-based microfluidic circuits.
Aiming to facilitate microfluidic circuit design, we describe a microfluidic
circuit using a five-level architecture: 1) Molecular Propagation; 2) Chemical
Transformation; 3) Microfluidic Modules; 4) Microfluidic Logic Gates; and 5)
Microfluidic Circuits. We first identify the components at Levels 1 and 2, and
present how their combinations can build the basic modules for Level 3. We then
assemble basic modules to construct five types of logic gate for Level 4,
including AND, NAND, OR, NOR, and XOR gates, which show advantages of
microfluidic circuits in reusability and modularity. Last but not least, we
discuss challenges and potential solutions for designing, building, and testing
microfluidic circuits with complex signal processing functions in Level 5 based
on the digital logic gates at Level 4.
"
2060,Forecasting timelines of quantum computing,"  We consider how to forecast progress in the domain of quantum computing. For
this purpose we collect a dataset of quantum computer systems to date, scored
on their physical qubits and gate error rate, and we define an index combining
both metrics, the generalized logical qubit. We study the relationship between
physical qubits and gate error rate, and tentatively conclude that they are
positively correlated (albeit with some room for doubt), indicating a frontier
of development that trades-off between them. We also apply a log-linear
regression on the metrics to provide a tentative upper bound on how much
progress can be expected over time. Within the (generally optimistic)
assumptions of our model, including the key assumption that exponential
progress in qubit count and gate fidelity will continue, we estimate that that
proof-of-concept fault-tolerant computation based onsuperconductor technology
is unlikely (<5% confidence) to be exhibited before 2026, and that quantum
devices capable of factoring RSA-2048 are unlikely (<5% confidence) to exist
before 2039. It is of course possible that these milestones will in fact be
reached earlier, but that this would require faster progress than has yet been
seen.
"
2061,Mapping the XY Hamiltonian onto a Network of Coupled Lasers,"  In recent years there has been a growing interest in the physical
implementation of classical spin models through networks of optical
oscillators. However, a key missing step in this mapping is to formally prove
that the dynamics of such a nonlinear dynamical system is toward minimizing a
global cost function which is equivalent with the spin model Hamiltonian. Here,
we introduce a minimal dynamical model for a network of dissipatively coupled
optical oscillators and prove that the dynamics of such a system is governed by
a Lyapunov function that serves as a cost function for the system. This cost
function is in general a function of both phases and intensities of the
oscillators and depends strongly on the pump parameter. In case of bipartite
network topologies, the amplitudes of the oscillators become identical in the
steady state and the cost function reduces to the XY Hamiltonian. In the
general case for non-trivial network topologies, however, the cost function
approaches the XY Hamiltonian only in the strong pump limit. We show that by
adiabatically tuning the pump parameter, the network can largely avoid trapping
into the local minima of the governing cost function and stabilize into the
ground state of the associated XY Hamiltonian. These results show the great
potential of laser networks for unconventional computing.

2062,"Simphony: An open-source photonic integrated circuit simulation
  framework","  We present Simphony, a free and open-source software toolbox for abstracting
and simulating photonic integrated circuits, implemented in Python. The toolbox
is both fast and easily extensible; plugins can be written to provide
compatibility with existing layout tools, and device libraries can be easily
created without a deep knowledge of programming. We include several examples of
photonic circuit simulations with novel features and demonstrate a speedup of
more than 20x over a leading commercially available software tool.
"
2063,Modeling networks of probabilistic memristors in SPICE,"  Efficient simulation of probabilistic memristors and their networks requires
novel modeling approaches. One major departure from the conventional memristor
modeling is based on a master equation for the occupation probabilities of
network states [arXiv:2003.11011 (2020)]. In the present article, we show how
to implement such master equations in SPICE - a general-purpose circuit
simulation program. In the case studies, we simulate the dynamics of ac-driven
probabilistic binary and multi-state memristors, and dc-driven networks of
probabilistic binary and multi-state memristors. Our SPICE results are in
perfect agreement with known analytical solutions. Examples of LTspice codes
are included.

2064,Reactive fungal wearable,"  Smart wearables sense and process information from the user's body and
environment and report results of their analysis as electrical signals.
Conventional electronic sensors and controllers are commonly, sometimes
augmented by recent advances in soft electronics. Organic electronics and
bioelectronics, especially with living substrates, offer a great opportunity to
incorporate parallel sensing and information processing capabilities of natural
systems into future and emerging wearables. Nowadays fungi are emerging as a
promising candidate to produce sustainable textiles to be used as ecofriendly
biowearables. To assess the sensing potential of fungal wearables we undertook
laboratory experiments on electrical response of a hemp fabric colonised by
oyster fungi~\emph{Pleurotus ostreatus} to mechanical stretching and
stimulation with attractants and repellents. We have shown that it is possible
to discern a nature of stimuli from the fungi electrical responses. The results
paved a way towards future design of intelligent sensing patches to be used in
reactive fungal wearables.

2065,"Circuit Design for K-coloring Problem and it's Implementation on
  Near-term Quantum Devices","  Now-a-days in Quantum Computing, implementation of quantum algorithm has
created a stir since Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices are out in
the market. Researchers are mostly interested in solving NP-complete problems
with the help of quantum algorithms for its speed-up. As per the work on
computational complexity by Karp, if any of the NP-complete problem can be
solved then any other NP-complete problem can be reduced to that problem in
polynomial time. In this Paper, K-coloring problem (NP-complete problem) has
been considered to solve using Grover's search. A comparator-based approach has
been used to implement K-coloring problem which enables the reduction of the
qubit cost comparing to the state-of-the-art. An end-to-end automated framework
has been proposed to implement K-coloring problem for any unweighted and
undirected graph on any available Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ)
devices, which helps in generalizing our approach.

2066,MERAM: Non-Volatile Cache Memory Based on Magneto-Electric FETs,"  Magneto-Electric FET (MEFET) is a recently developed post-CMOS FET, which
offers intriguing characteristics for high speed and low-power design in both
logic and memory applications. In this paper, for the first time, we propose a
non-volatile 2T-1MEFET memory bit-cell with separate read and write paths. We
show that with proper co-design at the device, cell and array levels, such a
design is a promising candidate for fast non-volatile cache memory, termed as
MERAM. To further evaluate its performance in memory system, we, for the first
time, build a device-to-architecture cross-layer evaluation framework based on
an experimentally-calibrated MEFET device model to quantitatively analyze and
benchmark the proposed MERAM design with other memory technologies, including
both volatile memory (i.e. SRAM, eDRAM) and other popular non-volatile emerging
memory (i.e. ReRAM, STT-MRAM, and SOT-MRAM). The experiment results show that
MERAM has a high state distinguishability with almost 36x magnitude difference
in sense current. Results for the PARSEC benchmark suite indicate that as an L2
cache alternative, MERAM reduces Energy Area Latency (EAT) product on average
by ~98\% and ~70\% compared with typical 6T SRAM and 2T SOT-MRAM platforms,
respectively.

  processes","  In this work, a versatile mathematical framework for multi-state
probabilistic modeling of Resistive Switching (RS) devices is proposed for the
first time. The mathematical formulation of memristor and Markov jump processes
are combined and, by using the notion of master equations for finite-states,
the inherent probabilistic time-evolution of RS devices is sufficiently
modeled. In particular, the methodology is generic enough and can be applied
for $N$ states; as a proof of concept, the proposed framework is further
stressed for both two-state RS paradigm, namely $N=2$, and multi-state devices,
namely $N=4$. The presented I-V results demonstrate in a qualitative and
quantitative manner, adequate matching with other modeling approaches.

2068,Modulated Signals in Chemical Reaction Networks,"  Electrical engineering and molecular programming share many of the same
mathematical foundations. In this paper, we show how to send multiple signals
through a single pair of chemical species using modulation and demodulation
techniques found in electrical engineering. Key to our construction, we provide
chemical implementations of classical linear band-pass and low-pass filters
with induced differential equations that are identical to their electrical
engineering counterparts. We show how to modulate \emph{arbitrary} independent
input signals with different carrier frequencies for transmission through a
shared medium. Specific signals in the medium can then be isolated and
demodulated using band-pass and low-pass filters. Such programmable chemical
band-pass filters also offer a way to monitor chemical systems to verify that
they are operating between a prescribed set of frequencies.

2069,"What Have Google's Random Quantum Circuit Simulation Experiments
  Demonstrated about Quantum Supremacy?","  Quantum computing is of high interest because it promises to perform at least
some kinds of computations much faster than classical computers. Arute et al.
2019 (informally, ""the Google Quantum Team"") report the results of experiments
that purport to demonstrate ""quantum supremacy"" -- the claim that the
performance of some quantum computers is better than that of classical
computers on some problems. Do these results close the debate over quantum
supremacy? We argue that they do not. We provide an overview of the Google
Quantum Team's experiments, then identify some open questions in the quest to
demonstrate quantum supremacy.

2070,"Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) Assisted Wireless Coverage
  Extension: RIS Orientation and Location Optimization","  Recently, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) have attracted a lot of
attention due to their capability of extending cell coverage by reflecting
signals toward the receiver. In this letter, we analyze the coverage of a
downlink RIS-assisted network with one base station (BS) and one user equipment
(UE). Since the RIS orientation and the horizontal distance between the RIS and
the BS have a significant influence on the cell coverage, we formulate an RIS
placement optimization problem to maximize the cell coverage by optimizing the
RIS orientation and horizontal distance. To solve the formulated problem, a
coverage maximization algorithm (CMA) is proposed, where a closed-form optimal
RIS orientation is obtained. Numerical results verify our analysis.

2071,"Exploring a Double Full-Stack Communications-Enabled Architecture for
  Multi-Core Quantum Computers","  Being a very promising technology, with impressive advances in the recent
years, it is still unclear how quantum computing will scale to satisfy the
requirements of its most powerful applications. Although continued progress in
the fabrication and control of qubits is required, quantum computing
scalability will depend as well on a comprehensive architectural design
considering a multi-core approach as an alternative to the traditional
monolithic version, hence including a communications perspective. However, this
goes beyond introducing mere interconnects. Rather, it implies consolidating
the full communications stack in the quantum computer architecture. In this
paper, we propose a double full-stack architecture encompassing quantum
computation and quantum communications, which we use to address the monolithic
versus multi-core question with a structured design methodology. For that, we
revisit the different quantum computing layers to capture and model their
essence by highlighting the open design variables and performance metrics.
Using behavioral models and actual measurements from existing quantum
computers, the results of simulations suggest that multi-core architectures may
effectively unleash the full quantum computer potential.
"
2072,On the spatiotemporal behavior in biology-mimicking computing systems,"  The payload performance of conventional computing systems, from single
processors to supercomputers, reached its limits the nature enables. Both the
growing demand to cope with ""big data"" (based on, or assisted by, artificial
intelligence) and the interest in understanding the operation of our brain more
completely, stimulated the efforts to build biology-mimicking computing systems
from inexpensive conventional components and build different (""neuromorphic"")
computing systems. On one side, those systems require an unusually large number
of processors, which introduces performance limitations and nonlinear scaling.
On the other side, the neuronal operation drastically differs from the
conventional workloads. The conventional computing (including both its
mathematical background and physical implementation) is based on assuming
instant interaction, while the biological neuronal systems have a
""spatiotemporal"" behavior. This difference alone makes imitating biological
behavior in technical implementation hard. Besides, the recent issues in
computing called the attention to that the temporal behavior is a general
feature of computing systems, too. Some of their effects in both biological and
technical systems were already noticed. Nevertheless, handling of those issues
is incomplete/improper. Introducing temporal logic, based on the Minkowski
transform, gives quantitative insight into the operation of both kinds of
computing systems, furthermore provides a natural explanation of decades-old
empirical phenomena. Without considering their temporal behavior correctly,
neither effective implementation nor a true imitation of biological neural
systems are possible.

2073,"ACSS-q: Algorithmic complexity for short strings via quantum accelerated
  approach","  In this research we present a quantum circuit for estimating algorithmic
complexity using the coding theorem method. This accelerates inferring
algorithmic structure in data for discovering causal generative models. The
computation model is restricted in time and space resources to make it
computable in approximating the target metrics. The quantum circuit design
based on our earlier work that allows executing a superposition of automata is
presented. As a use-case, an application framework for protein-protein
interaction ontology based on algorithmic complexity is proposed. Using
small-scale quantum computers, this has the potential to enhance the results of
classical block decomposition method towards bridging the causal gap in entropy
based methods.
"
2074,"Closed-loop spiking control on a neuromorphic processor implemented on
  the iCub","  Despite neuromorphic engineering promises the deployment of low latency,
adaptive and low power systems that can lead to the design of truly autonomous
artificial agents, the development of a fully neuromorphic artificial agent is
still missing. While neuromorphic sensing and perception, as well as
decision-making systems, are now mature, the control and actuation part is
lagging behind. In this paper, we present a closed-loop motor controller
implemented on mixed-signal analog-digital neuromorphic hardware using a
spiking neural network. The network performs a proportional control action by
encoding target, feedback, and error signals using a spiking relational
network. It continuously calculates the error through a connectivity pattern,
which relates the three variables by means of feed-forward connections.
Recurrent connections within each population are used to speed up the
convergence, decrease the effect of mismatch and improve selectivity. The
neuromorphic motor controller is interfaced with the iCub robot simulator. We
tested our spiking P controller in a single joint control task, specifically
for the robot head yaw. The spiking controller sends the target positions,
reads the motor state from its encoder, and sends back the motor commands to
the joint. The performance of the spiking controller is tested in a step
response experiment and in a target pursuit task. In this work, we optimize the
network structure to make it more robust to noisy inputs and device mismatch,
which leads to better control performances.
"
2075,"Enabling Resource-Aware Mapping of Spiking Neural Networks via Spatial
  Decomposition","  With growing model complexity, mapping Spiking Neural Network (SNN)-based
applications to tile-based neuromorphic hardware is becoming increasingly
challenging. This is because the synaptic storage resources on a tile, viz. a
crossbar, can accommodate only a fixed number of pre-synaptic connections per
post-synaptic neuron. For complex SNN models that have many pre-synaptic
connections per neuron, some connections may need to be pruned after training
to fit onto the tile resources, leading to a loss in model quality, e.g.,
accuracy. In this work, we propose a novel unrolling technique that decomposes
a neuron function with many pre-synaptic connections into a sequence of
homogeneous neural units, where each neural unit is a function computation
node, with two pre-synaptic connections. This spatial decomposition technique
significantly improves crossbar utilization and retains all pre-synaptic
connections, resulting in no loss of the model quality derived from connection
pruning. We integrate the proposed technique within an existing SNN mapping
framework and evaluate it using machine learning applications on the DYNAP-SE
state-of-the-art neuromorphic hardware. Our results demonstrate an average 60%
lower crossbar requirement, 9x higher synapse utilization, 62% lower wasted
energy on the hardware, and between 0.8% and 4.6% increase in model quality.
"
2076,"Analysing and Measuring the Performance ofMemristive Integrating
  Amplifiers","  Recording reliably extracellular neural activities isan essential
prerequisite for the development of bioelectronicsand neuroprosthetic
applications. Recently, a fully differential,2-stage, integrating pre-amplifier
was proposed for amplifyingand then digitising neural signals. The amplifier
featured a finelytuneable offset that was used as a variable threshold
detector.Given that the amplifier is integrating, the DC operating pointkeeps
changing during integration, rendering traditional analysis(AC/DC) unsuitable.
In this work, we analyse the operation ofthis circuit and propose alternative
definitions for validating thenecessary key performance metrics, including:
gain, bandwidth,offset tuning range and offset sensitivity with respect to
thememory states of the employed memristors. The amplificationprocess is
analysed largely through investigating the transientbehaviour during the
integration phase. This benchmarkingapproach is finally leveraged for providing
useful insights anddesign trade-offs of the memristor-based integrating
amplifier.
"
2077,"TIGER: Topology-aware Assignment using Ising machines Application to
  Classical Algorithm Tasks and Quantum Circuit Gates","  Optimally mapping a parallel application to compute and communication
resources is increasingly important as both system size and heterogeneity
increase. A similar mapping problem exists in gate-based quantum computing
where the objective is to map tasks to gates in a topology-aware fashion. This
is an NP-complete graph isomorphism problem, and existing task assignment
approaches are either heuristic or based on physical optimization algorithms,
providing different speed and solution quality trade-offs. Ising machines such
as quantum and digital annealers have recently become available and offer an
alternative hardware solution to solve this type of optimization problems. In
this paper, we propose an algorithm that allows solving the topology-aware
assignment problem using Ising machines. We demonstrate the algorithm on two
use cases, i.e. classical task scheduling and quantum circuit gate scheduling.
TIGER---topology-aware task/gate assignment mapper tool---implements our
proposed algorithms and automatically integrates them into the quantum software
environment. To address the limitations of physical solver, we propose and
implement a domain-specific partition strategy that allows solving larger-scale
problems and a weight optimization algorithm that allows tuning Ising model
parameters to achieve better restuls. We use D-Wave's quantum annealer to
demonstrate our algorithm and evaluate the proposed tool flow in terms of
performance, partition efficiency, and solution quality. Results show
significant speed-up compared to classical solutions, better scalability, and
higher solution quality when using TIGER together with the proposed partition
method. It reduces the data movement cost by 68\% in average for quantum
circuit assignment compared to the IBM QX optimizer.
"
2078,"TSV Extrusion Morphology Classification Using Deep Convolutional Neural
  Networks","  In this paper, we utilize deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to
classify the morphology of through-silicon via (TSV) extrusion in three
dimensional (3D) integrated circuits (ICs). TSV extrusion is a crucial
reliability concern which can deform and crack interconnect layers in 3D ICs
and cause device failures. Herein, the white light interferometry (WLI)
technique is used to obtain the surface profile of the extruded TSVs. We have
developed a program that uses raw data obtained from WLI to create a TSV
extrusion morphology dataset, including TSV images with 54x54 pixels that are
labeled and categorized into three morphology classes. Four CNN architectures
with different network complexities are implemented and trained for TSV
extrusion morphology classification application. Data augmentation and dropout
approaches are utilized to realize a balance between overfitting and
underfitting in the CNN models. Results obtained show that the CNN model with
optimized complexity, dropout, and data augmentation can achieve a
classification accuracy comparable to that of a human expert.
"
2079,Collective and synchronous dynamics of photonic spiking neurons,"  Nonlinear dynamics of spiking neural networks has recently attracted much
interest as an approach to understand possible information processing in the
brain and apply it to artificial intelligence. Since information can be
processed by collective spiking dynamics of neurons, the fine control of
spiking dynamics is desirable for neuromorphic devices. Here we show that
photonic spiking neurons implemented with paired nonlinear optical oscillators
can be controlled to generate two modes of bio-realistic spiking dynamics by
changing the optical pump amplitude. When they are coupled in a network, we
found that the interaction between the photonic neurons induces an effective
change in the pump amplitude depending on the order parameter that
characterizes synchronization. The experimental results show that the effective
change causes spontaneous modification of the spiking modes and firing rates of
clustered neurons, and such collective dynamics can be utilized to realize
efficient heuristics for solving NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems.
"
2080,"Design and Evaluation of a Receiver for Wired Nano-Communication
  Networks","  In this paper, we propose a bio-inspired receiver, which detects the
electrons transmitted through a nanowire, then, it converts the detected
information into a blue light using bioluminescence. Using light allows the
designed receiver to also act as a relay for the nearest gateway
(photo-detector). We simulate the construction of the nanowire, present its
electrical characteristics and calculate its maximum throughput for a better
design of the receiver. The designed receiver contains two parts, a part that
detects the transmitted electrons, which we model by using an equivalent
circuit, and a part that converts the detected electrons into a blue light. We
derive the analytical expressions of the equivalent circuit's components, and
we calculate the emitted photons for each electrical pulse detected. We also
propose modulation techniques that guaranty an effective decoding of the
information. We send a binary message and we follow the electron detection
process of the proposed receiver until light emission and we calculate the Bit
Error Rate (BER) to evaluate the performance of the designed receiver. The
results of this study show that the designed receiver can accurately detect the
electrons sent through a conductive nanowire in wired nano-communication
networks, and that it can also act as a relay for the nearest gateway.
"
2081,Reliability-Performance Trade-offs in Neuromorphic Computing,"  Neuromorphic architectures built with Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) can
significantly improve the energy efficiency of machine learning tasks designed
with Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). A major source of voltage drop in a
crossbar of these architectures are the parasitic components on the crossbar's
bitlines and wordlines, which are deliberately made longer to achieve lower
cost-per-bit. We observe that the parasitic voltage drops create a significant
asymmetry in programming speed and reliability of NVM cells in a crossbar.
Specifically, NVM cells that are on shorter current paths are faster to program
but have lower endurance than those on longer current paths, and vice versa.
This asymmetry in neuromorphic architectures create reliability-performance
trade-offs, which can be exploited efficiently using SNN mapping techniques. In
this work, we demonstrate such trade-offs using a previously-proposed SNN
mapping technique with 10 workloads from contemporary machine learning tasks
for a state-of-the art neuromoorphic hardware.
"
2082,"A Machine Learning-based Approach to Detect Threats in Bio-Cyber DNA
  Storage Systems","  Data storage is one of the main computing issues of this century. Not only
storage devices are converging to strict physical limits, but also the amount
of data generated by users is growing at an unbelievable rate. To face these
challenges, data centres grew constantly over the past decades. However, this
growth comes with a price, particularly from the environmental point of view.
Among various promising media, DNA is one of the most fascinating candidate. In
our previous work, we have proposed an automated archival architecture which
uses bioengineered bacteria to store and retrieve data, previously encoded into
DNA. This storage technique is one example of how biological media can deliver
power-efficient storing solutions. The similarities between these biological
media and classical ones can also be a drawback, as malicious parties might
replicate traditional attacks on the former archival system, using biological
instruments and techniques. In this paper, first we analyse the main
characteristics of our storage system and the different types of attacks that
could be executed on it. Then, aiming at identifying on-going attacks, we
propose and evaluate detection techniques, which rely on traditional metrics
and machine learning algorithms. We identify and adapt two suitable metrics for
this purpose, namely generalized entropy and information distance. Moreover,
our trained models achieve an AUROC over 0.99 and AUPRC over 0.91.
"
2083,"Temporal State Machines: Using temporal memory to stitch time-based
  graph computations","  Race logic, an arrival-time-coded logic family, has demonstrated energy and
performance improvements for applications ranging from dynamic programming to
machine learning. However, the ad hoc mappings of algorithms into hardware
result in custom architectures making them difficult to generalize. We
systematize the development of race logic by associating it with the
mathematical field called tropical algebra. This association between the
mathematical primitives of tropical algebra and generalized race logic
computations guides the design of temporally coded tropical circuits. It also
serves as a framework for expressing high level timing-based algorithms. This
abstraction, when combined with temporal memory, allows for the systematic
generalization of race logic by making it possible to partition feed-forward
computations into stages and organizing them into a state machine. We leverage
analog memristor-based temporal memories to design a such a state machine that
operates purely on time-coded wavefronts. We implement a version of Dijkstra's
algorithm to evaluate this temporal state machine. This demonstration shows the
promise of expanding the expressibility of temporal computing to enable it to
deliver significant energy and throughput advantages.
"
2084,Realization of p_valued Deutsch quantum gates,"  In this report reversible Toffoli and quantum Deutsch gates are extended to
the p_valued domain. Their structural parameters are determined and their
behavior is proven. Both conjunctive and disjunctive control strategies with
positive and mixed polarities are introduced for the first time in a p_valued
domain. The design is based on elementary Muthukrishnan_Stroud quantum gates,
hence the realizability of the extended gates in the context of ion traps
should be possible.
"
2085,Post-Quantum Error-Correction for Quantum Annealers,"  We present a general post-quantum error-correcting technique for quantum
annealing, called multi-qubit correction (MQC), that views the evolution in an
open-system as a Gibs sampler and reduces a set of (first) excited states to a
new synthetic state with lower energy value. After sampling from the ground
state of a given (Ising) Hamiltonian, MQC compares pairs of excited states to
recognize virtual tunnels -- i.e., a group of qubits that changing their states
simultaneously can result in a new state with lower energy -- and successively
converges to the ground state. Experimental results using D-Wave 2000Q quantum
annealers demonstrate that MQC finds samples with notably lower energy values
and also improves the reproducibility of results, compared to recent
hardware/software advances in the realm of quantum annealing such as reverse
quantum annealing, increased inter-sample delay, and classical
pre/post-processing methods.
"
2086,Non-Markovian Momentum Computing: Universal and Efficient,"  All computation is physically embedded. Reflecting this, a growing body of
results embraces rate equations as the underlying mechanics of thermodynamic
computation and biological information processing. Strictly applying the
implied continuous-time Markov chains, however, excludes a universe of natural
computing. We show that expanding the toolset to continuous-time hidden Markov
chains substantially removes the constraints. The general point is made
concrete by our analyzing two eminently-useful computations that are impossible
to describe with a set of rate equations over the memory states. We design and
analyze a thermodynamically-costless bit flip, providing a first counterexample
to rate-equation modeling. We generalize this to a costless Fredkin gate---a
key operation in reversible computing that is computation universal. Going
beyond rate-equation dynamics is not only possible, but necessary if stochastic
thermodynamics is to become part of the paradigm for physical information
processing.
"
2087,The Fourier signatures of memristive hysteresis,"  While resistors with memory, sometimes called memristive elements (such as
ReRAM cells), are often studied under conditions of periodic driving, little
attention has been paid to the Fourier features of their memory response
(hysteresis). Here we demonstrate experimentally that the hysteresis of
memristive systems can be unambiguously distinguished from the linear or
non-linear response of systems without hysteresis by the values of certain
Fourier series coefficients. We also show that the Fourier series convergence
depends on driving conditions. These results may be used to quantify the memory
content of resistive memories and tune their Fourier spectrum according to the
excitation signal.
"
2088,Resonant Energy Recycling SRAM Architecture,"  Although we may be at the end of Moore's law, lowering chip power consumption
is still the primary driving force for the designers. To enable low-power
operation, we propose a resonant energy recovery static random access memory
(SRAM). We propose the first series resonance scheme to reduce the dynamic
power consumption of the SRAM operation. Besides, we identified the requirement
of supply boosting of the write buffers for proper resonant operation. We
evaluated the resonant 144KB SRAM cache through SPICE and test chip using a
commercial 28nm CMOS technology. The experimental results show that the
resonant SRAM can save up to 30% dynamic power at 1GHz operating frequency
compared to the state-of-the-art design.
"
2089,Robust High-dimensional Memory-augmented Neural Networks,"  Traditional neural networks require enormous amounts of data to build their
complex mappings during a slow training procedure that hinders their abilities
for relearning and adapting to new data. Memory-augmented neural networks
enhance neural networks with an explicit memory to overcome these issues.
Access to this explicit memory, however, occurs via soft read and write
operations involving every individual memory entry, resulting in a bottleneck
when implemented using the conventional von Neumann computer architecture. To
overcome this bottleneck, we propose a robust architecture that employs a
computational memory unit as the explicit memory performing analog in-memory
computation on high-dimensional vectors, while closely matching 32-bit
software-equivalent accuracy. This is enabled by a content-based attention
mechanism that represents unrelated items in the computational memory with
uncorrelated high-dimensional vectors, whose real-valued components can be
readily approximated by binary, or bipolar components. Experimental results
demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on few-shot image classification tasks
on the Omniglot dataset using more than 256,000 phase-change memory devices.
"
2090,Quantum Bayesian decision-making*,"  As a compact representation of joint probability distributions over a
dependence graph of random variables, and a tool for modelling and reasoning in
the presence of uncertainty, Bayesian networks are of great importance for
artificial intelligence to combine domain knowledge, capture causal
relationships, or learn from incomplete datasets. Known as a NP-hard problem in
a classical setting, Bayesian inference pops up as a class of algorithms worth
to explore in a quantum framework. This paper explores such a research
direction and improves on previous proposals by a judicious use of the utility
function in an entangled configuration. It proposes a completely quantum
mechanical decision-making process with a proven computational advantage. A
prototype implementation in Qiskit (a Python-based program development kit for
the IBM Q machine) is discussed as a proof-of-concept.
"
2091,"A Concentration-Time Hybrid Modulation Scheme for Molecular
  Communications","  Significant inter-symbol interference (ISI) challenges the achievement of
reliable, high data-rate molecular communication via diffusion. In this paper,
a hybrid modulation based on pulse position and concentration is proposed to
mitigate ISI. By exploiting the time dimension, molecular concentration and
position modulation (MCPM) increases the achievable data rate over conventional
concentration and position-based modulations. In addition, unlike
multi-molecule schemes, this hybrid scheme employs a single-molecule type and
simplifies transceiver implementations. In the paper, the optimal sequence
detector of the proposed modulation is provided as well as a reduced complexity
detector (two-stage, position-concentration detector, TPCD). A tractable cost
function based on the TPCD detector is proposed and employed to optimize the
design of the hybrid modulation scheme. In addition, the approximate
probability of error for the MCPM-TPCD system is derived and is shown to be
tight with respect to simulated performance. Numerically, MCPM is shown to
offer improved performance over standard concentration and pulse position-based
schemes in the low transmission power and high bit-rate regime. Furthermore,
MCPM offers increased robustness against synchronization errors.
"
2092,"WoLFRaM: Enhancing Wear-Leveling and Fault Tolerance in Resistive
  Memories using Programmable Address Decoders","  Resistive memories have limited lifetime caused by limited write endurance
and highly non-uniform write access patterns. Two main techniques to mitigate
endurance-related memory failures are 1) wear-leveling, to evenly distribute
the writes across the entire memory, and 2) fault tolerance, to correct memory
cell failures. However, one of the main open challenges in extending the
lifetime of existing resistive memories is to make both techniques work
together seamlessly and efficiently. To address this challenge, we propose
WoLFRaM, a new mechanism that combines both wear-leveling and fault tolerance
techniques at low cost by using a programmable resistive address decoder
(PRAD). The key idea of WoLFRaM is to use PRAD for implementing 1) a new
efficient wear-leveling mechanism that remaps write accesses to random physical
locations on the fly, and 2) a new efficient fault tolerance mechanism that
recovers from faults by remapping failed memory blocks to available physical
locations. Our evaluations show that, for a Phase Change Memory (PCM) based
system with cell endurance of 108 writes, WoLFRaM increases the memory lifetime
by 68% compared to a baseline that implements the best state-of-the-art
wear-leveling and fault correction mechanisms. WoLFRaM's average / worst-case
performance and energy overheads are 0.51% / 3.8% and 0.47% / 2.1%
respectively.
"
2093,Symbolic Verification of Quantum Circuits,"  This short note proposes a symbolic approach for representing and reasoning
about quantum circuits using complex, vector or matrix-valued Boolean

the diversity offered by RISs to generate and select easily differentiable
radio maps for use in wireless fingerprinting localization applications.
Further, we apply machine learning feature selection methods to prune the large
state space of the RIS, thus reducing complexity and enhancing localization
accuracy and position acquisition time. We evaluate our proposed approach by
generation of radio maps with a novel radio propagation modelling and
simulations.
"
2095,"Phase Configuration Learning in Wireless Networks with Multiple
  Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces","  Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) are recently gaining remarkable
attention as a low-cost, hardware-efficient, and highly scalable technology
capable of offering dynamic control of electro-magnetic wave propagation. Their
envisioned dense deployment over various obstacles of the, otherwise passive,
wireless communication environment has been considered as a revolutionary means
to transform them into network entities with reconfigurable properties,
providing increased environmental intelligence for diverse communication
objectives. One of the major challenges with RIS-empowered wireless
communications is the low-overhead dynamic configuration of multiple RISs,
which according to the current hardware designs have very limited computing and
storage capabilities. In this paper, we consider a typical communication pair
between two nodes that is assisted by a plurality of RISs, and devise
low-complexity supervised learning approaches for the RISs' phase
configurations. By assuming common tunable phases in groups of each RIS's unit
elements, we present multi-layer perceptron Neural Network (NN) architectures
that can be trained either with positioning values or the instantaneous channel
coefficients. We investigate centralized and individual training of the RISs,
as well as their federation, and assess their computational requirements. Our
simulation results, including comparisons with the optimal phase configuration
scheme, showcase the benefits of adopting individual NNs at RISs for the link
budget performance boosting.
"
2096,"Thermal-Aware Compilation of Spiking Neural Networks to Neuromorphic
  Hardware","  Hardware implementation of neuromorphic computing can significantly improve
performance and energy efficiency of machine learning tasks implemented with
spiking neural networks (SNNs), making these hardware platforms particularly
suitable for embedded systems and other energy-constrained environments. We
observe that the long bitlines and wordlines in a crossbar of the hardware
create significant current variations when propagating spikes through its
synaptic elements, which are typically designed with non-volatile memory (NVM).
Such current variations create a thermal gradient within each crossbar of the
hardware, depending on the machine learning workload and the mapping of neurons
and synapses of the workload to these crossbars. \mr{This thermal gradient
becomes significant at scaled technology nodes and it increases the leakage
power in the hardware leading to an increase in the energy consumption.} We
propose a novel technique to map neurons and synapses of SNN-based machine
learning workloads to neuromorphic hardware. We make two novel contributions.
First, we formulate a detailed thermal model for a crossbar in a neuromorphic
hardware incorporating workload dependency, where the temperature of each
NVM-based synaptic cell is computed considering the thermal contributions from
its neighboring cells. Second, we incorporate this thermal model in the mapping
of neurons and synapses of SNN-based workloads using a hill-climbing heuristic.
The objective is to reduce the thermal gradient in crossbars. We evaluate our
neuron and synapse mapping technique using 10 machine learning workloads for a
state-of-the-art neuromorphic hardware. We demonstrate an average 11.4K
reduction in the average temperature of each crossbar in the hardware, leading
to a 52% reduction in the leakage power consumption (11% lower total energy
consumption) compared to a performance-oriented SNN mapping technique.
"
2097,"Using the Parameterized Quantum Circuit combined with
  Variational-Quantum-Eigensolver (VQE) to create an Intelligent social
  workers' schedule problem solver","  The social worker scheduling problem is a class of combinatorial optimization
problems that combines scheduling with routing issues. These types of problems
with classical computing can only be solved, in the best of cases, in an
approximate way and significantly when the input data does not grow
considerably. Today, the focus on the quantum computer should no longer be only
on its enormous computing power, but also on the use of its imperfection for
this era, (Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ)) to create a powerful
optimization and learning device that uses variational techniques. We had
already proposed a formulation and solution of this problem using the capacity
of the quantum computer. In this article, we present some broad results of the
experimentation techniques. And above all, we propose an adaptive and
intelligence solution, which efficiently recalculates the schedules of social
workers. Taking into account new restrictions and changes in the initial
conditions, by using a case-based reasoning system and the variational quantum
eigensolver based on a finite-depth quantum circuit. That encodes the ground
state of the Hamiltonian of social workers.
  The quantum feasibility of the algorithm will be modelled with docplex and
tested on IBMQ computers.
"
2098,A Novel Quantum Algorithm for Ant Colony Optimization,"  Ant colony optimization is one of the potential solutions to tackle
intractable NP-Hard discrete combinatorial optimization problems. The metaphor
of ant colony can be thought of as the evolution of the best path from a given
graph as a globally optimal solution, which is unaffected by earlier local
convergence to achieve improved optimization efficiency. Earlier Quantum Ant
Colony Optimization research work was primarily based on Quantum-inspired
Evolutionary Algorithms, which deals with customizing and improving the quantum
rotation gate through upgraded formation of the lookup table of rotation angle.
Instead of relying on evolutionary algorithms, we have proposed a discrete-time
quantum algorithm based on adaptive quantum circuit for pheromone updation. The
algorithm encodes all possible paths in the exhaustive search space as input to
the ORACLE. Iterative model of exploration and exploitation of all possible
paths by quantum ants results in global optimal path convergence through
probabilistic measurement of selected path. Our novel approach attempts to
accelerate the search space exploitation in a significant manner to obtain the
best optimal path as a solution through quantum arallelization achieving
polynomial time speed-up over its classical counter part.

2099,"Teaching Quantum Computing through a Practical Software-driven Approach:
  Experience Report","  Quantum computing harnesses quantum laws of nature to enable new types of
algorithms, not efficiently possible on traditional computers, that may lead to
breakthroughs in crucial areas like materials science and chemistry. There is
rapidly growing demand for a quantum workforce educated in the basics of
quantum computing, in particular in quantum programming. However, there are few
offerings for non-specialists and little information on best practices for
training computer science and engineering students.
  In this report we describe our experience teaching an undergraduate course on
quantum computing using a practical, software-driven approach. We centered our
course around teaching quantum algorithms through hands-on programming,
reducing the significance of traditional written assignments and relying
instead on self-paced programming exercises (""Quantum Katas""), a variety of
programming assignments, and a final project. We observed that the programming
sections of the course helped students internalize theoretical material
presented during the lectures. In the survey results, students indicated that
the programming exercises and the final project contributed the most to their
learning process.
  We describe the motivation for centering the course around quantum
programming, discuss major artifacts used in this course, and present our
lessons learned and best practices for a future improved course offering. We
hope that our experience will help guide instructors who want to adopt a
practical approach to teaching quantum computing and will enable more
undergraduate programs to offer quantum programming as an elective.

2100,QDLC -- The Quantum Development Life Cycle,"  The magnificence grandeur of quantum computing lies in the inherent nature of
quantum particles to exhibit true parallelism, which can be realized by
indubitably fascinating theories of quantum physics. The possibilities opened
by quantum computation (QC) is no where analogous to any classical simulation
as quantum computers can efficiently simulate the complex dynamics of strongly
correlated inter-facial systems. But, unfolding mysteries and leading to
revolutionary breakthroughs in quantum computing are often challenged by lack
of research and development potential in developing qubits with longer
coherence interval, scaling qubit count, incorporating quantum error correction
to name a few. Putting the first footstep into explorative quantum research by
researchers and developers is also inherently ambiguous - due to lack of
definitive steps in building up a quantum enabled customized computing stack.
Difference in behavioral pattern of underlying system, early-stage noisy
device, implementation barriers and performance metric cause hindrance in full
adoption of existing classical SDLC suites for quantum product development.
This in turn, necessitates to devise systematic and cost-effective techniques
to quantum software development through a Quantum Development Life Cycle (QDLC)
model, specifying the distinguished features and functionalities of quantum
feasibility study, quantum requirement specification, quantum system design,
quantum software coding and implementation, quantum testing and quantum
software quality management.

2101,"Quantum computing approach to railway dispatching and conflict
  management optimization on single-track railway lines","  We consider a railway dispatching problem: delay and conflict management on a
single-track railway line. We examine the issue of train dispatching
consequences caused by the arrival of an already delayed train to the segment
being considered. This is a computationally hard problem and its solution is
needed in a very short time in practice. We introduce a quadratic unconstrained
binary optimization (QUBO) model of the problem that is suitable for solving on
quantum annealer devices: an emerging alternative computational hardware
technology. These offer a scalability of computationally hard problems better
than that of classical computers. We provide a proof-of-principle demonstration
of applicability through solving selected real-life problems from the Polish
railway network. We carry out the actual calculation on the D-Wave 2000Q
machine. We also include solutions of our model using classical algorithms for
solving QUBO, including those based on tensor networks. These are of potential
practical relevance in case of smaller instances and serve as a comparison for
understanding the behavior of the actual quantum device.
"
2102,Optoelectronic Intelligence,"  To design and construct hardware for general intelligence, we must consider
principles of both neuroscience and very-large-scale integration. For large
neural systems capable of general intelligence, the attributes of photonics for
communication and electronics for computation are complementary and
interdependent. Using light for communication enables high fan-out as well as
low-latency signaling across large systems with no traffic-dependent
bottlenecks. For computation, the inherent nonlinearities, high speed, and low
power consumption of Josephson circuits are conducive to complex neural
functions. Operation at 4\,K enables the use of single-photon detectors and
silicon light sources, two features that lead to efficiency and economical
scalability. Here I sketch a concept for optoelectronic hardware, beginning
with synaptic circuits, continuing through wafer-scale integration, and
extending to systems interconnected with fiber-optic white matter, potentially
at the scale of the human brain and beyond.
"
2103,"End-to-end Wireless Path Deployment with Intelligent Surfaces Using
  Interpretable Neural Networks","  Intelligent surfaces exert deterministic control over the wireless
propagation phenomenon, enabling novel capabilities in performance, security
and wireless power transfer. Such surfaces come in the form of rectangular
tiles that cascade to cover large surfaces such as walls, ceilings or building
facades. Each tile is addressable and can receive software commands from a
controller, manipulating an impinging electromagnetic wave upon it by
customizing its reflection direction, focus, polarization and phase. A new
problem arises concerning the orchestration of a set of tiles towards serving
end-to-end communication objectives. Towards that end, we propose a novel
intelligent surface networking algorithm based on interpretable neural
networks. Tiles are mapped to neural network nodes and any tile line-of-sight
connectivity is expressed as a neural network link. Tile wave manipulation
functionalities are captured via geometric reflection with virtually rotatable
tile surface norm, thus being able to tunable distribute power impinging upon a
tile over the corresponding neural network links, with the corresponding power
parts acting as the link weights. A feedforward/backpropagate process optimizes
these weights to match ideal propagation outcomes (normalized network power
outputs) to wireless user emissions (normalized network power inputs). An
interpretation process translates these weights to the corresponding tile wave
manipulation functionalities.
"
2104,Compiling quantamorphisms for the IBM Q Experience,"  Based on the connection between the categorical derivation of classical
programs from specifications and the category-theoretic approach to quantum
physics, this paper contributes to extending the laws of classical program
algebra to quantum programming. This aims at building correct-by-construction
quantum circuits to be deployed on quantum devices such as those available at
the IBM Q Experience. Quantum circuit reversibility is ensured by minimal
complements, extended recursively. Measurements are postponed to the end of
such recursive computations, termed ""quantamorphisms"", thus maximising the
quantum effect. Quantamorphisms are classical catamorphisms which, extended to
ensure quantum reversibility, implement quantum cycles (vulg. for-loops) and
quantum folds on lists. By Kleisli correspondence, quantamorphisms can be
written as monadic functional programs with quantum parameters. This enables
the use of Haskell, a monadic functional programming language, to perform the
experimental work. Such calculated quantum programs prepared in Haskell are
pushed through Quipper to the Qiskit interface to IBM Q quantum devices. The
generated quantum circuits - often quite large - exhibit the predicted
behaviour. However, running them on real quantum devices incurs into a
significant amount of errors. As quantum devices are constantly evolving, an
increase in reliability is likely in the near future, allowing for our programs
to run more accurately.
"
2105,Exploring the Impact of Affine Loop Transformations in Qubit Allocation,"  Most quantum compiler transformations and qubit allocation techniques to date
are either peep-hole focused or rely on sliding windows that depend on a number
of external parameters. Thus, global optimization criteria are still lacking.
In this paper we explore the synergies and impact of affine loop
transformations in the context of qubit allocation and mapping. With this goal
in mind, we have implemented a domain specific language and source-to-source
compiler for quantum circuits that can be directly described with affine
relations. We conduct an extensive evaluation spanning 8 quantum circuits taken
from the literature, 3 distinct coupling graphs, 4 affine transformations
(including the Pluto dependence distance minimization and Feautrier's minimum
latency algorithms), and 4 qubit allocators. Our results demonstrate that
affine transformations using global optimization criteria can cooperate
effectively in several scenarios with quantum qubit mapping algorithms to
reduce the circuit depth, size and allocation time.
"
2106,"MARS: Multi-macro Architecture SRAM CIM-Based Accelerator with
  Co-designed Compressed Neural Networks","  Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) play a key role in deep learning
applications. However, the large storage overheads and the substantial
computation cost of CNNs are problematic in hardware accelerators.
Computing-in-memory (CIM) architecture has demonstrated great potential to
effectively compute large-scale matrix-vector multiplication. However, the
intensive multiply and accumulation (MAC) operations executed at the crossbar
array and the limited capacity of CIM macros remain bottlenecks for further
improvement of energy efficiency and throughput. To reduce computation costs,
network pruning and quantization are two widely studied compression methods to
shrink the model size. However, most of the model compression algorithms can
only be implemented in digital-based CNN accelerators. For implementation in a
static random access memory (SRAM) CIM-based accelerator, the model compression
algorithm must consider the hardware limitations of CIM macros, such as the
number of word lines and bit lines that can be turned on at the same time, as
well as how to map the weight to the SRAM CIM macro. In this study, a software
and hardware co-design approach is proposed to design an SRAM CIM-based CNN
accelerator and an SRAM CIM-aware model compression algorithm. To lessen the
high-precision MAC required by batch normalization (BN), a quantization
algorithm that can fuse BN into the weights is proposed. Furthermore, to reduce
the number of network parameters, a sparsity algorithm that considers a CIM
architecture is proposed. Last, MARS, a CIM-based CNN accelerator that can
utilize multiple SRAM CIM macros as processing units and support a sparsity
neural network, is proposed.
"
2107,"ExPAN(N)D: Exploring Posits for Efficient Artificial Neural Network
  Design in FPGA-based Systems","  The recent advances in machine learning, in general, and Artificial Neural
Networks (ANN), in particular, has made smart embedded systems an attractive
option for a larger number of application areas. However, the high
computational complexity, memory footprints, and energy requirements of machine
learning models hinder their deployment on resource-constrained embedded
systems. Most state-of-the-art works have considered this problem by proposing
various low bit-width data representation schemes, optimized arithmetic
operators' implementations, and different complexity reduction techniques such
as network pruning. To further elevate the implementation gains offered by
these individual techniques, there is a need to cross-examine and combine these
techniques' unique features. This paper presents ExPAN(N)D, a framework to
analyze and ingather the efficacy of the Posit number representation scheme and
the efficiency of fixed-point arithmetic implementations for ANNs. The Posit
scheme offers a better dynamic range and higher precision for various
applications than IEEE $754$ single-precision floating-point format. However,
due to the dynamic nature of the various fields of the Posit scheme, the
corresponding arithmetic circuits have higher critical path delay and resource
requirements than the single-precision-based arithmetic units. Towards this
end, we propose a novel Posit to fixed-point converter for enabling
high-performance and energy-efficient hardware implementations for ANNs with
minimal drop in the output accuracy. We also propose a modified Posit-based
representation to store the trained parameters of a network. Compared to an
$8$-bit fixed-point-based inference accelerator, our proposed implementation
offers $\approx46\%$ and $\approx18\%$ reductions in the storage requirements
of the parameters and energy consumption of the MAC units, respectively.
"
2108,"Entangled and correlated photon mixed strategy for social decision
  making","  Collective decision making is important for maximizing total benefits while
preserving equality among individuals in the competitive multi-armed bandit
(CMAB) problem, wherein multiple players try to gain higher rewards from
multiple slot machines. The CMAB problem represents an essential aspect of
applications such as resource management in social infrastructure. In a
previous study, we theoretically and experimentally demonstrated that entangled
photons can physically resolve the difficulty of the CMAB problem. This
decision-making strategy completely avoids decision conflicts while ensuring
equality. However, decision conflicts can sometimes be beneficial if they yield
greater rewards than non-conflicting decisions, indicating that greedy actions
may provide positive effects depending on the given environment. In this study,
we demonstrate a mixed strategy of entangled- and correlated-photon-based
decision-making so that total rewards can be enhanced when compared to the
entangled-photon-only decision strategy. We show that an optimal mixture of
entangled- and correlated-photon-based strategies exists depending on the
dynamics of the reward environment as well as the difficulty of the given
problem. This study paves the way for utilizing both quantum and classical
aspects of photons in a mixed manner for decision making and provides yet
another example of the supremacy of mixed strategies known in game theory,
especially in evolutionary game theory.
"
2109,"Teaching Quantum Computing to an Audience Beyond Physicists: A Case
  Study over 22 Workshops in 10 Countries","  Quantum computing is a topic mainly rooted in physics, and it has been
gaining rapid popularity in recent years. A need for extending the educational
reach to groups outside of physics has also been becoming a necessity.
Following this, a shift in educational mindset considering teaching quantum
computing as a generalized probability theory rather than a field emanating
from physics is beginning to emerge. This is best actualized through the
utilization of quantum programming as an education tool for an introduction to
quantum computing. To this end, in this study we have assessed the
effectiveness of a three-day hands-on introduction to quantum programming
workshop called QBronze, organized and administered by QWorld initiative,
covering the Bronze material formulated according to this mindset. Gathered
data consists of pre and post-test results of 317 participants from 22
workshops held between May of 2019 and March of 2020 in ten countries. We
assessed the increase in basic knowledge of quantum computing concepts at
participants through a series of questions on quantum phenomena, quantum logic
gates, and quantum algorithms. We have found that the knowledge levels of
participants on quantum computing have increased for all levels of education,
regardless of department or gender. Therefore, we argue that hands-on
programming tasks based training workshops focusing on quantum computing as a
generalized probability theory is an effective way to introduce quantum
computing to a wider audience.
"
2110,Achieving a quantum smart workforce,"  Interest in building dedicated Quantum Information Science and Engineering
(QISE) education programs has greatly expanded in recent years. These programs
are inherently convergent, complex, often resource intensive and likely require
collaboration with a broad variety of stakeholders. In order to address this
combination of challenges, we have captured ideas from many members in the
community. This manuscript not only addresses policy makers and funding
agencies (both public and private and from the regional to the international
level) but also contains needs identified by industry leaders and discusses the
difficulties inherent in creating an inclusive QISE curriculum. We report on
the status of eighteen post-secondary education programs in QISE and provide
guidance for building new programs. Lastly, we encourage the development of a
comprehensive strategic plan for quantum education and workforce development as
a means to make the most of the ongoing substantial investments being made in
QISE.
"
2111,Structure-based Optical Logics Without Using Transistors,"  The commercialization of transistors capable of both switching and
amplification in 1960 resulted in the development of second-generation
computers, which resulted in the miniaturization and lightening while
accelerating the reduction and development of production costs. However, the
self-resistance and the resistance used in conjunction with semiconductors,
which are the basic principles of computers, generate a lot of heat, which
results in semiconductor obsolescence, and limits the computation speed (clock
rate). In implementing logic operation, this paper proposes the concept of
Structure-based Computer which can implement NOT gate made of semiconductor
transistor only by Structure-based twist of cable without resistance. In
Structure-based computer, the theory of 'inverse signal pair' of digital
signals was introduced so that it could operate in a different way than
semiconductor-based transistors. In this paper, we propose a new hardware
called Structure-based computer that can solve various problems in
semiconductor computers only with the wiring structure of the conductor itself,
not with the silicon-based semiconductor. Furthermore, we propose a
deep-priority exploration-based simulation method that can easily implement and
test complex Structure-based computer circuits. Furthermore, this paper
suggests a mechanism to implement optical computers currently under development
and research based on structures rather than devices.
"
2112,"Implementing efficient balanced networks with mixed-signal spike-based
  learning circuits","  Efficient Balanced Networks (EBNs) are networks of spiking neurons in which
excitatory and inhibitory synaptic currents are balanced on a short timescale,
leading to desirable coding properties such as high encoding precision, low
firing rates, and distributed information representation. It is for these
benefits that it would be desirable to implement such networks in low-power
neuromorphic processors. However, the degree of device mismatch in analog
mixed-signal neuromorphic circuits renders the use of pre-trained EBNs
challenging, if not impossible. To overcome this issue, we developed a novel
local learning rule suitable for on-chip implementation that drives a randomly
connected network of spiking neurons into a tightly balanced regime. Here we
present the integrated circuits that implement this rule and demonstrate their
expected behaviour in low-level circuit simulations. Our proposed method paves
the way towards a system-level implementation of tightly balanced networks on
analog mixed-signal neuromorphic hardware. Thanks to their coding properties
and sparse activity, neuromorphic electronic EBNs will be ideally suited for
extreme-edge computing applications that require low-latency, ultra-low power
consumption and which cannot rely on cloud computing for data processing.
"
2113,Receptor Saturation Modeling for Synaptic DMC,"  Synaptic communication is a natural Molecular Communication (MC) system which
may serve as a blueprint for the design of synthetic MC systems. In particular,
it features highly specialized mechanisms to enable inter-symbol interference
(ISI)-free and energy efficient communication. The understanding of synaptic MC
is furthermore critical for disruptive innovations in the context of
brain-machine interfaces. However, the physical modeling of synaptic MC is
complicated by the possible saturation of the molecular receiver arising from
the competition of postsynaptic receptors for neurotransmitters. Saturation
renders the system behavior nonlinear and is commonly neglected in existing
analytical models. In this work, we propose a novel model for receptor
saturation in terms of a nonlinear, state-dependent boundary condition for
Fick's diffusion equation. We solve the resulting boundary-value problem using
an eigenfunction expansion of the Laplace operator and the incorporation of the
receiver memory as feedback system into the corresponding state-space
description. The presented solution is numerically stable and computationally
efficient. Furthermore, the proposed model is validated with particle-based
stochastic computer simulations.
"
2114,"Quantum Computing: A Taxonomy, Systematic Review and Future Directions","  Quantum computing is an emerging paradigm with the potential to offer
significant computational advantage over conventional classical computing by
exploiting quantum-mechanical principles such as entanglement and
superposition. It is anticipated that this computational advantage of quantum
computing will help to solve many complex and computationally intractable
problems in several areas of research such as drug design, data science, clean
energy, finance, industrial chemical development, secure communications, and
quantum chemistry, among others. In recent years, tremendous progress in both
quantum hardware development and quantum software/algorithm have brought
quantum computing much closer to reality. As the quantum devices are expected
to steadily scale up in the next few years, quantum decoherence and qubit
interconnectivity are two of the major challenges to achieve quantum advantage
in the NISQ era. Quantum computing is a highly topical and fast-moving field of
research with significant ongoing progress in all facets. A systematic review
of the existing literature on quantum computing will be invaluable to
understand the current status of this emerging field and identify open
challenges for the quantum computing community in the coming years. This review
article presents a comprehensive review of quantum computing literature, and
taxonomy of quantum computing. Further, the proposed taxonomy is used to map
various related studies to identify the research gaps. A detailed overview of
quantum software tools and technologies, post-quantum cryptography and quantum
computer hardware development to document the current state-of-the-art in the
respective areas. We finish the article by highlighting various open challenges
and promising future directions for research.
"
2115,"Limitations of the recall capabilities in delay based reservoir
  computing systems","  We analyze the memory capacity of a delay based reservoir computer with a
Hopf normal form as nonlinearity and numerically compute the linear as well as
the higher order recall capabilities. A possible physical realisation could be
a laser with external cavity, for which the information is fed via electrical
injection. A task independent quantification of the computational capability of
the reservoir system is done via a complete orthonormal set of basis functions.
Our results suggest that even for constant readout dimension the total memory
capacity is dependent on the ratio between the information input period, also
called the clock cycle, and the time delay in the system. Optimal performance
is found for a time delay about 1.6 times the clock cycle
"
2116,"A Non-Volatile Cryogenic Random-Access Memory Based on the Quantum
  Anomalous Hall Effect","  The interplay between ferromagnetism and topological properties of electronic
band structures leads to a precise quantization of Hall resistance without any
external magnetic field. This so-called quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) is
born out of topological correlations, and is oblivious of low-sample quality.
It was envisioned to lead towards dissipationless and topologically protected
electronics. However, no clear framework of how to design such an electronic
device out of it exists. Here we construct an ultra-low power, non-volatile,
cryogenic memory architecture leveraging the QAHE phenomenon. Our design
promises orders of magnitude lower cell area compared with the state-of-the-art
cryogenic memory technologies. We harness the fundamentally quantized Hall
resistance levels in moir\'e graphene heterostructures to store non-volatile
binary bits (1, 0). We perform the memory write operation through controlled
hysteretic switching between the quantized Hall states, using nano-ampere level
currents with opposite polarities. The non-destructive read operation is
performed by sensing the polarity of the transverse Hall voltage using a
separate pair of terminals. We custom design the memory architecture with a
novel sensing mechanism to avoid accidental data corruption, ensure highest
memory density and minimize array leakage power. Our design is transferrable to
any material platform exhibiting QAHE, and provides a pathway towards realizing
topologically protected memory devices.
"
2117,"Mitigating Write Disturbance Errors of Phase-Change Memory as In-Module
  Approach","  With the growing demand for technology scaling and storage capacity in server
systems to support high-performance computing, phase-change memory (PCM) has
garnered attention as the next-generation non-volatile memory to satisfy these
requirements. However, write disturbance error (WDE) appears as a serious
reliability problem preventing PCM from general commercialization. WDE occurs
on the neighboring cells of a written cell due to heat dissipation. Previous
studies for the prevention of WDEs are based on the write cache or
verify-n-correction while they often suffer from significant area overhead and
performance degradation, making it unsuitable for high-performance computing.
Therefore, an on-demand correction is required to minimize the performance
overhead. In this paper, an in-module disturbance barrier (IMDB) mitigating
WDEs is proposed. IMDB includes two sets of SRAMs into two levels and evicts
entries with a policy that leverages the characteristics of WDE. In this work,
the comparator dedicated to the replacement policy requires significant
hardware resources and latency. Thus, an approximate comparator is designed to
reduce the area and latency considerably. Furthermore, the exploration of
architecture parameters is conducted to obtain cost-effective design. The
proposed work significantly reduces WDEs without a noticeable speed degradation
and additional energy consumption compared to previous methods.
"
2118,RANC: Reconfigurable Architecture for Neuromorphic Computing,"  Neuromorphic architectures have been introduced as platforms for energy
efficient spiking neural network execution. The massive parallelism offered by
these architectures has also triggered interest from non-machine learning
application domains. In order to lift the barriers to entry for hardware
designers and application developers we present RANC: a Reconfigurable
Architecture for Neuromorphic Computing, an open-source highly flexible
ecosystem that enables rapid experimentation with neuromorphic architectures in
both software via C++ simulation and hardware via FPGA emulation. We present
the utility of the RANC ecosystem by showing its ability to recreate behavior
of the IBM's TrueNorth and validate with direct comparison to IBM's Compass
simulation environment and published literature. RANC allows optimizing
architectures based on application insights as well as prototyping future
neuromorphic architectures that can support new classes of applications
entirely. We demonstrate the highly parameterized and configurable nature of
RANC by studying the impact of architectural changes on improving application
mapping efficiency with quantitative analysis based on Alveo U250 FPGA. We
present post routing resource usage and throughput analysis across
implementations of Synthetic Aperture Radar classification and Vector Matrix
Multiplication applications, and demonstrate a neuromorphic architecture that
scales to emulating 259K distinct neurons and 73.3M distinct synapses.
"
2119,"Membrane Fusion-Based Transmitter Design for Molecular Communication
  Systems","  This paper proposes a novel imperfect spherical transmitter (TX) model,
namely the membrane fusion (MF)-based TX, that adopts MF between a vesicle and
the TX membrane to release molecules encapsulated within the vesicle. For the
MF-based TX, the molecule release probability and the fraction of molecules
released from the TX membrane are derived. Incorporating molecular degradation
and a fully-absorbing receiver (RX), the end-to-end molecule hitting
probability at the RX is also derived. A simulation framework for the MF-based
TX is proposed, where the released point on the TX membrane and the released
time of each molecule are determined. Aided by the simulation framework, the
derived analytical expressions are validated. Simulation results verify that a
low MF probability or low vesicle mobility slows the release of molecules from
the TX, extends time required to reach the peak release probability, and
reduces the end-to-end molecule hitting probability at the RX.

2120,"Blockchain for Decentralization of Internet: Prospects, Trends, and
  Challenges","  Blockchain has made an impact on today's technology by revolutionizing the
financial industry in its utilization on cryptocurrency and the features it
provided on decentralization. With the current trend of pursuing the
decentralized Internet, many methods have been proposed to achieve
decentralization considering different aspects of the current Internet model
ranging from infrastructure and protocols to services and applications. This
paper focuses on using Blockchain to provide a robust and secure decentralized
computing system. The paper conducts a literature review on Blockchain-based
methods capable for the decentralization of the future Internet. To achieve
that decentralization, two research aspects of Blockchain have been
investigated that are highly relevant in realizing the decentralized Internet.
The first aspect is the consensus algorithms, which are vital components for
decentralization of Blockchain. We have identified three consensus algorithms
being PoP, Paxos, and PoAH to be more adequate for reaching consensus in
Blockchain-enabled Internet architecture. The second aspect that we
investigated is the impact of future Internet technologies on Blockchain, where
their combinations with Blockchain would help to make it overcome its
established flaws and be more optimized and applicable for Internet
decentralization.
"
2121,Variational certification of quantum devices,"  One of the requirements imposed on the realistic quantum computers is to
provide computation results which can be repeated and reproduced. In the
situation when one needs to repeat the quantum computation procedure several
times, it is crucial that the copies of the quantum devices are similar in the
sense of the produced results. In this work, we describe a simple procedure for
based on variational quantum eigensolver which can be utilized to compare
quantum devices. The procedure is developed by combining Choi-Jamio{\l}kowski
isomorphism with the variational hybrid quantum-classical procedure for matrix
diagonalization. We compare the introduced procedure with the scheme based on
the standard bounds for the similarity between quantum operations by analysing
its operation on random quantum operations.
"
2122,"Localization in Terahertz-Operating Energy Harvesting Software-Defined
  Metamaterials","  Software-Defined Metamaterials (SDMs) show a strong potential for advancing
the engineered control of electromagnetic waves. As such, they are envisioned
to enable a variety of exciting applications, among others in the domains of
smart textiles, high-resolution structural monitoring, and sensing in
challenging environments. Many of the applications envisage deformations of the
SDM structure, such as its bending, stretching or rolling, which implies that
the locations of metamaterial elements will be changing relative to one
another. In this paper, we argue that if the metamaterial elements would be
accurately localizable, this location information could potentially be utilized
for enabling novel SDM applications, as well as for optimizing the control of
the elements themselves. To enable their localization, we assume that these
elements are controlled wirelessly through a Terahertz (THz)-operating
nanonetwork. We consider the elements to be energy-constrained, with their sole
powering option being to harvest environmental energy. By means of simulation,
we demonstrate sub-millimeter accuracy of the two-way Time of Flight
(ToF)-based localization, as well as high availability of the service (i.e.,
consistently more than 80% of the time), which is a result of the low energy
consumed during localization. Finally, we qualitatively characterize the
latency of the proposed localization service, as well as outline several
challenges and future research directions.
"
2123,Learning to Approximate Functions Using Nb-doped SrTiO$_3$ Memristors,"  Memristors have attracted interest as neuromorphic computation elements
because they show promise in enabling efficient hardware implementations of
artificial neurons and synapses. We performed measurements on interface-type
memristors to validate their use in neuromorphic hardware. Specifically, we
utilised Nb-doped SrTiO$_3$ memristors as synapses in a simulated neural
network by arranging them into differential synaptic pairs, with the weight of
the connection given by the difference in normalised conductance values between
the two paired memristors. This network learned to represent functions through
a training process based on a novel supervised learning algorithm, during which
discrete voltage pulses were applied to one of the two memristors in each pair.
To simulate the fact that both the initial state of the physical memristive
devices and the impact of each voltage pulse are unknown we injected noise at
each time step. Nevertheless, discrete updates based on local knowledge were
shown to result in robust learning performance. Using this class of memristive
devices as the synaptic weight element in a spiking neural network yields, to
our knowledge, one of the first models of this kind, capable of learning to be
a universal function approximator, and strongly suggests the suitability of
these memristors for usage in future computing platforms.
"
2124,Image Classification via Quantum Machine Learning,"  Quantum Computing and especially Quantum Machine Learning, in a short period
of time, has gained a lot of interest through research groups around the world.
This can be seen in the increasing number of proposed models for pattern
classification applying quantum principles to a certain degree. Despise the
increasing volume of models, there is a void in testing these models on real
datasets and not only on synthetic ones. The objective of this work is to
classify patterns with binary attributes using a quantum classifier. Specially,
we show results of a complete quantum classifier applied to image datasets. The
experiments show favorable output while dealing with balanced classification
problems as well as with imbalanced classes where the minority class is the
most relevant. This is promising in medical areas, where usually the important
class is also the minority class.
"
2125,"Nonlinear Quantum Neuron: A Fundamental Building Block for Quantum
  Neural Networks","  Quantum computing enables quantum neural networks (QNNs) to have great
potentials to surpass artificial neural networks (ANNs). The powerful
generalization of neural networks is attributed to nonlinear activation
functions. Although various models related to QNNs have been developed, they
are facing the challenge of merging the nonlinear, dissipative dynamics of
neural computing into the linear, unitary quantum system. In this paper, we
establish different quantum circuits to approximate nonlinear functions and
then propose a generalizable framework to realize any nonlinear quantum neuron.
We present two quantum neuron examples based on the proposed framework. The
quantum resources required to construct a single quantum neuron are the
polynomial, in function of the input size. Finally, both IBM Quantum Experience
results and numerical simulations illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed
framework.

2126,"Graphene-based Wireless Agile Interconnects for Massive Heterogeneous
  Multi-chip Processors","  The main design principles in computer architecture have recently shifted
from a monolithic scaling-driven approach to the development of heterogeneous
architectures that tightly co-integrate multiple specialized processor and
memory chiplets. In such data-hungry multi-chip architectures, current
Networks-in-Package (NiPs) may not be enough to cater to their heterogeneous
and fast-changing communication demands. This position paper makes the case for
wireless in-package nanonetworking as the enabler of efficient and versatile
wired-wireless interconnect fabrics for massive heterogeneous processors. To
that end, the use of graphene-based antennas and transceivers with unique
frequency-beam reconfigurability in the terahertz band is proposed. The
feasibility of such a nanonetworking vision and the main research challenges
towards its realization are analyzed from the technological, communications,
and computer architecture perspectives.
"
2127,"Principles of Stochastic Computing: Fundamental Concepts and
  Applications","  The semiconductor and IC industry is facing the issue of high energy
consumption. In modern days computers and processing systems are designed based
on the Turing machine and Von Neumann's architecture. This architecture mainly
focused on designing systems based on deterministic behaviors. To tackle energy
consumption and reliability in systems, Stochastic Computing was introduced. In
this research, we aim to review and study the principles behind stochastic
computing and its implementation techniques. By utilizing stochastic computing,
we can achieve higher energy efficiency and smaller area sizes in terms of
designing arithmetic units. Also, we aim to popularize the affiliation of
Stochastic systems in designing futuristic BLSI and Neuromorphic systems.

2128,"Domain Wall Leaky Integrate-and-Fire Neurons with Shape-Based
  Configurable Activation Functions","  Complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) devices display volatile
characteristics, and are not well suited for analog applications such as
neuromorphic computing. Spintronic devices, on the other hand, exhibit both
non-volatile and analog features, which are well-suited to neuromorphic
computing. Consequently, these novel devices are at the forefront of
beyond-CMOS artificial intelligence applications. However, a large quantity of
these artificial neuromorphic devices still require the use of CMOS, which
decreases the efficiency of the system. To resolve this, we have previously
proposed a number of artificial neurons and synapses that do not require CMOS
for operation. Although these devices are a significant improvement over
previous renditions, their ability to enable neural network learning and
recognition is limited by their intrinsic activation functions. This work
proposes modifications to these spintronic neurons that enable configuration of
the activation functions through control of the shape of a magnetic domain wall
track. Linear and sigmoidal activation functions are demonstrated in this work,
which can be extended through a similar approach to enable a wide variety of
activation functions.

2129,"Thermoformed Circuit Boards: Fabrication of highly conductive freeform
  3D printed circuit boards with heat bending","  Fabricating 3D printed electronics using desktop printers has become more
accessible with recent developments in conductive thermoplastic filaments.
Because of their high resistance and difficulties in printing traces in
vertical directions, most applications are restricted to capacitive sensing. In
this paper, we introduce Thermoformed Circuit Board (TCB), a novel approach
that employs the thermoformability of the 3D printed plastics to construct
various double-sided, rigid and highly conductive freeform circuit boards that
can withstand high current applications through copper electroplating. To
illustrate the capability of the TCB, we showcase a range of examples with
various shapes, electrical characteristics and interaction mechanisms. We also
demonstrate a new design tool extension to an existing CAD environment that
allows users to parametrically draw the substrate and conductive trace, and
export 3D printable files. TCB is an inexpensive and accessible fabrication
technique that can broaden participation.

2130,"Efficient Solution of Boolean Satisfiability Problems with Digital
  MemComputing","  Boolean satisfiability is a propositional logic problem of interest in
multiple fields, e.g., physics, mathematics, and computer science. Beyond a
field of research, instances of the SAT problem, as it is known, require
efficient solution methods in a variety of applications. It is the decision
problem of determining whether a Boolean formula has a satisfying assignment,
believed to require exponentially growing time for an algorithm to solve for
the worst-case instances. Yet, the efficient solution of many classes of
Boolean formulae eludes even the most successful algorithms, not only for the
worst-case scenarios, but also for typical-case instances. Here, we introduce a
memory-assisted physical system (a digital memcomputing machine) that, when its
non-linear ordinary differential equations are integrated numerically, shows
evidence for polynomially-bounded scalability while solving ""hard""
planted-solution instances of SAT, known to require exponential time to solve
in the typical case for both complete and incomplete algorithms. Furthermore,
we analytically demonstrate that the physical system can efficiently solve the
SAT problem in continuous time, without the need to introduce chaos or an
exponentially growing energy. The efficiency of the simulations is related to
the collective dynamical properties of the original physical system that
persist in the numerical integration to robustly guide the solution search even
in the presence of numerical errors. We anticipate our results to broaden
research directions in physics-inspired computing paradigms ranging from theory
to application, from simulation to hardware implementation.

2131,Quantum Period Finding against Symmetric Primitives in Practice,"  We present the first complete implementation of the offline Simon's
algorithm, and estimate its cost to attack the MAC Chaskey, the block cipher
PRINCE and the NIST lightweight candidate AEAD scheme Elephant.
  These attacks require a reasonable amount of qubits, comparable to the number
of qubits required to break RSA-2048. They are faster than other collision
algorithms, and the attacks against PRINCE and Chaskey are the most efficient
known to date. As Elephant has a key smaller than its state size, the algorithm
is less efficient and ends up more expensive than exhaustive search.
  We also propose an optimized quantum circuit for boolean linear algebra as
well as complete reversible implementations of PRINCE, Chaskey, spongent and
Keccak which are of independent interest for quantum cryptanalysis.
  We stress that our attacks could be applied in the future against today's
communications, and recommend caution when choosing symmetric constructions for
cases where long-term security is expected.

2132,"In-Memory Nearest Neighbor Search with FeFET Multi-Bit
  Content-Addressable Memories","  Nearest neighbor (NN) search is an essential operation in many applications,
such as one/few-shot learning and image classification. As such, fast and
low-energy hardware support for accurate NN search is highly desirable. Ternary
content-addressable memories (TCAMs) have been proposed to accelerate NN search
for few-shot learning tasks by implementing $L_\infty$ and Hamming distance
metrics, but they cannot achieve software-comparable accuracies. This paper
proposes a novel distance function that can be natively evaluated with
multi-bit content-addressable memories (MCAMs) based on ferroelectric FETs
(FeFETs) to perform a single-step, in-memory NN search. Moreover, this approach
achieves accuracies comparable to floating-point precision implementations in
software for NN classification and one/few-shot learning tasks. As an example,
the proposed method achieves a 98.34% accuracy for a 5-way, 5-shot
classification task for the Omniglot dataset (only 0.8% lower than
software-based implementations) with a 3-bit MCAM. This represents a 13%
accuracy improvement over state-of-the-art TCAM-based implementations at
iso-energy and iso-delay. The presented distance function is resilient to the
effects of FeFET device-to-device variations. Furthermore, this work
experimentally demonstrates a 2-bit implementation of FeFET MCAM using AND
arrays from GLOBALFOUNDRIES to further validate proof of concept.
"
2133,Memristor networks learn by mistakes,"  Recent results in adaptive matter revived the interest in the implementation
of novel devices able to perform brain-like operations. Here we introduce a
training algorithm for a memristor network which is inspired in previous work
on biological learning. Robust results are obtained from computer simulations
of a network of voltage controlled memristive devices. Its implementation in
hardware is straightforward, being scalable and requiring very little
peripheral computation overhead.
"
2134,Random Stimuli Generation for the Verification of Quantum Circuits,"  Verification of quantum circuits is essential for guaranteeing correctness of
quantum algorithms and/or quantum descriptions across various levels of
abstraction. In this work, we show that there are promising ways to check the
correctness of quantum circuits using simulative verification and random
stimuli. To this end, we investigate how to properly generate stimuli for
efficiently checking the correctness of a quantum circuit. More precisely, we
introduce, illustrate, and analyze three schemes for quantum stimuli
generation---offering a trade-off between the error detection rate (as well as
the required number of stimuli) and efficiency. In contrast to the verification
in the classical realm, we show (both, theoretically and empirically) that even
if only a few randomly-chosen stimuli (generated from the proposed schemes) are
considered, high error detection rates can be achieved for quantum circuits.
The results of these conceptual and theoretical considerations have also been
empirically confirmed---with a grand total of approximately $10^6$ simulations
conducted across 50 000 benchmark instances.

2135,"Channel Tiling for Improved Performance and Accuracy of Optical Neural
  Network Accelerators","  Low latency, high throughput inference on Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs)
remains a challenge, especially for applications requiring large input or large
kernel sizes. 4F optics provides a solution to accelerate CNNs by converting
convolutions into Fourier-domain point-wise multiplications that are
computationally 'free' in optical domain. However, existing 4F CNN systems
suffer from the all-positive sensor readout issue which makes the
implementation of a multi-channel, multi-layer CNN not scalable or even
impractical. In this paper we propose a simple channel tiling scheme for 4F CNN
systems that utilizes the high resolution of 4F system to perform channel
summation inherently in optical domain before sensor detection, so the outputs
of different channels can be correctly accumulated. Compared to state of the
art, channel tiling gives similar accuracy, significantly better robustness to
sensing quantization (33\% improvement in required sensing precision) error and
noise (10dB reduction in tolerable sensing noise), 0.5X total filters required,
10-50X+ throughput improvement and as much as 3X reduction in required output
camera resolution/bandwidth. Not requiring any additional optical hardware, the
proposed channel tiling approach addresses an important throughput and
precision bottleneck of high-speed, massively-parallel optical 4F computing
systems.

2136,"Circuit-based quantum random access memory for classical data with
  continuous amplitudes","  Loading data in a quantum device is required in several quantum computing
applications. Without an efficient loading procedure, the cost to initialize
the algorithms can dominate the overall computational cost. A circuit-based
quantum random access memory named FF-QRAM can load M n-bit patterns with
computational cost O(CMn) to load continuous data where C depends on the data
distribution. In this work, we propose a strategy to load continuous data
without post-selection with computational cost O(Mn). The proposed method is
based on the probabilistic quantum memory, a strategy to load binary data in
quantum devices, and the FF-QRAM using standard quantum gates, and is suitable
for noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers.

2137,"Revising the classic computing paradigm and its technological
  implementations","  Today's computing is told to be based on the classic paradigm, proposed by
von Neumann, a three-quarter century ago. However, that paradigm was justified
(for the timing relations of) vacuum tubes only. The technological development
invalidated the classic paradigm (but not the model!) and led to catastrophic
performance losses in computing systems, from operating gate level to large
networks, including the neuromorphic ones. The paper reviews the critical
points of the classic paradigm and scrutinizes the confusion made around it. It
discusses some of the consequences of improper technological implementation,
from the shared media to the parallelized operation. The model is perfect, but
it is applied outside of its range of validity. The paradigm is extended by
providing the ""procedure"" that enables computing science to work with cases
where the transfer time is not negligible apart from processing time.

2138,"Distributed Injection-Locking in Analog Ising Machines to Solve
  Combinatorial Optimizations","  The oscillator-based Ising machine (OIM) is a network of coupled CMOS
oscillators that solves combinatorial optimization problems. In this paper, the
distribution of the injection-locking oscillations throughout the circuit is
proposed to accelerate the phase-locking of the OIM. The implications of the
proposed technique theoretically investigated and verified by extensive
simulations in EDA tools with a $130~nm$ PTM model. By distributing the
injective signal of the super-harmonic oscillator, the speed is increased by
$219.8\%$ with negligible increase in the power dissipation and phase-locking
error of the device due to the distributed technique.

2139,"Coupled VO2 oscillators circuit as analog first layer filter in
  convolutional neural networks","  In this work we present an in-memory computing platform based on coupled VO2
oscillators fabricated in a crossbar configuration on silicon. Compared to
existing platforms, the crossbar configuration promises significant
improvements in terms of area density and oscillation frequency. Further, the
crossbar devices exhibit low variability and extended reliability, hence,
enabling experiments on 4-coupled oscillator. We demonstrate the neuromorphic
computing capabilities using the phase relation of the oscillators. As a
application, we propose to replace digital filtering operation in a
convolutional neural network with oscillating circuits. The concept is tested
with a VGG13 architecture on the MNIST dataset, achieving performances of 95%
in the recognition task.
"
2140,"Experimental implementation of secure anonymous protocols on an
  eight-user quantum network","  Anonymity in networked communication is vital for many privacy-preserving
tasks. Secure key distribution alone is insufficient for high-security
communications, often knowing who transmits a message to whom and when must
also be kept hidden from an adversary. Here we experimentally demonstrate 5
information-theoretically secure anonymity protocols on an 8 user city-wide
quantum network using polarisation-entangled photon pairs. At the heart of
these protocols is anonymous broadcasting, which is a cryptographic primitive
that allows one user to reveal one bit of information while keeping her
identity anonymous. For a network of $n$ users, the protocols retain anonymity
for the sender, given less than $n-2$ users are dishonest. This is one of the
earliest implementations of genuine multi-user cryptographic protocols beyond
standard QKD. Our anonymous protocols enhance the functionality of any
fully-connected Quantum Key Distribution network without trusted nodes.

2141,"Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface-Assisted Uplink Sparse Code Multiple
  Access","  Reconfigurable intelligent surface-empowered communication (RIS) and sparse
code multiple access (SCMA) are promising candidates for future generations of
wireless networks. The former enhances the transmission environments, whereas
the latter provides a high spectral efficiency transmission. This letter
proposes, for the first time, an RIS-assisted uplink SCMA (SCMA-RIS) scheme to
improve the conventional SCMA spectrum efficiency. The message passing
algorithm (MPA) is utilized and modified to decode the SCMA-RIS transmitted
signals. Moreover, a low-complexity decoder for the SCMA-RIS scheme is proposed
to significantly reduce the MPA decoding complexity and improve the bit error
rate performance of the conventional SCMA. Monte-Carlo simulations and
complexity analysis are presented, which support the findings.

2142,Note on Needle in a Haystack,"  Introduced below is a quantum database method, not only for retrieval but
also for creation. It uses a particular structure of true's and false's in a
state vector of n qubits, permitting up to 2**2**n words, vastly more than for
classical bits. Several copies are produced so that later they can be
destructively observed and a word determined with high probability. Grover's
algorithm is proposed below to read out, nondestructively the unknown contents
of a given stored state vector using only one state vector.
